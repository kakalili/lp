crystal structure of e coli hsp  clpb nucleotide binding domain  nbd  and mechanistic studies on clpb atpase activity
e coli hsp  clpb was recently identified as a critical part in a multi chaperone system to play important roles in protein folding protein transport and degradation in cell physiology clpb contains two nucleotide binding domains nbd and nbd  within their primary sequences nbd and nbd of clpb can be classified as members of the large atpase family known as atpases associated with various cellular activities aaa  to investigate how clpb performs its atpase activities for its chaperone activity we have determined the crystal structure of clpb nucleotide binding domain  nbd  by mad method to    resolution the nbd monomer structure contains one domain that comprises    helices and six  strands when compared with the typical aaa structures the crystal structure of clpb nbd reveals a novel aaa topology with six stranded  sheet as its core the n terminal portion of nbd structure has an extra  strand flanked by two extra  helices that are not present in other aaa structures moreover the nbd structure does not have a c terminal helical domain as other aaa proteins do no nucleotide molecule is bound with clpb nbd in the crystal structure probably due to lack of the c terminal helix domain in the structure isothermal titration calorimetry itc studies of clpb nbd and other clpb deletion mutations showed that either clpb nbd or nbd alone does not bind to nucleotides however clpb nbd combined with clpb c terminal fragment can interact with one adp or atp molecule itc data also indicated that full length clpb could bind two adp molecules or one atp analogue atp s molecule further atpase activity studies of clpb and clpb deletion mutants showed that only wild type clpb have atpase activity none of clpb nbd domain nbd domain and nbd with c terminal fragment has detectable atpase activities on the basis of our structural and mutagenesis data we proposed a  see saw  model to illustrate the mechanisms by which clpb performs its atpase activities for chaperone functions
