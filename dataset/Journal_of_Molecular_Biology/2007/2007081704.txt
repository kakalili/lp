The nucleotide sequences that control transcription initiation and regulation in Mycoplasma pneumoniae are poorly understood. Moreover, only few regulatory events have been reported for M. pneumoniae. We have studied changes in the global protein synthesis pattern in M. pneumoniae in response to the presence of glycerol. The ackA and ldh genes, encoding acetate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, respectively, were controlled in a carbon source-dependent manner. While the ackA gene was strongly expressed in the presence of glucose, transcription of ldh was induced by glycerol. The promoters of both genes were mapped by primer extension analysis. Molecular analysis of transcription regulatory mechanisms in M. pneumoniae has so far not been possible due to the lack of appropriate reporter systems that can be used to study the activity of promoter fragments and their mutant derivatives in vivo. Recently, a reporter system has been developed which allows cloning of promoter fragments in front of a promoterless lacZ gene and inserting this construct into the genome of M. pneumoniae. To study the requirements of M. pneumoniae RNA polymerase for promoter recognition, a series of fusions of deletion and mutant variants of the ldh promoter was constructed and analyzed in vivo. While mutations affecting the −10 region strongly interfered with gene expression, the −35 region seems to be of minor importance in M. pneumoniae.
