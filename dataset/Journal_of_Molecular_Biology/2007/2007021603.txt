Escherichia coli phage N4 infection leads to delayed host cell lysis, 3000 particles per infected bacterium and a small plaque phenotype. We show that bacteriophage N4 encodes a murein hydrolase (gp61) that is essential for N4 plaque-forming ability. gp61 has a high level of sequence similarity to hypothetical proteobacterial proteins, and Vibrio harveyi phage VHML ORF 19. Nano-electrospray ionization (nESI) quadrupole ion trap (QIT) mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of muropeptides from purified gp61 digestion of E. coli peptidoglycan indicates that gp61 is an N-acetylmuramidase. The EGGY motif present near the N terminus of gp61 and its homologs contains the glutamic acid residue essential for enzymatic activity. These results provide evidence that N4 gp61 and its homologs define a new family of N-acetylmuramidases (pfam05838.4, DUF847, COG3926). In contrast to its homologs, gp61 contains an N-terminal signal sequence. When expressed at levels present during phage infection, gp61 localizes primarily to the cell inner membrane; in contrast, over-expression of recombinant N4 gp61 is sufficient for rapid cell lysis. Overproduction of the recombinant Salmonella typhimurium (STM0016) homolog is sufficient for cell lysis only when fused to the gp61 N-terminal signal sequence. The results of subcellular localization and of mutagenesis of the gp61 N-terminal signal sequence indicate that gp61 must be released from the inner membrane to be catalytically active.
