clickseq fragmentation free next generation sequencing via click ligation of adaptors to stochastically terminated   azido cdnas
we present a simple method called  clickseq  for ngs next generation sequencing library synthesis that uses click chemistry rather than enzymatic reactions for the ligation of illumina sequencing adaptors in clickseq randomly primed reverse transcription reactions are supplemented with azido      dideoxynucleotides that randomly terminate dna synthesis and release   azido blocked cdna fragments in a process akin to dideoxy sanger sequencing purified fragments are  click ligated  via copper catalyzed alkyne azide cycloaddition to dna oligos modified with a   alkyne group this generates ssdna molecules containing an unnatural triazole linked dna backbone that is sufficiently biocompatible for pcr amplification to generate a cdna library for rnaseq here we analyze viral rnas and mrna to demonstrate that clickseq produces unbiased ngs libraries with low error rates comparable to standard methods importantly clickseq is robust against common artifacts of ngs such as chimera formation and artifactual recombination with fewer than  aberrant events detected per million reads
