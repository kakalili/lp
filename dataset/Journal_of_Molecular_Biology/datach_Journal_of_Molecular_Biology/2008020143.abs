a new twist in tcr diversity revealed by a forbidden   tcr
we report crystal structures of a negatively selected t cell receptor tcr that recognizes two i au restricted myelin basic protein peptides and one of its peptide major histocompatibility complex pmhc ligands unusual complementarity determining region cdr structural features revealed by our analyses identify a previously unrecognized mechanism by which the highly variable cdr regions define ligand specificity in addition to the pmhc contact residues contributed by cdr  the cdr residues buried deep within the v  v  interface exert indirect effects on recognition by influencing the v  v  interdomain angle this phenomenon represents an additional mechanism for increasing the potential diversity of the tcr repertoire both the direct and indirect effects exerted by cdr residues can impact global tcr mhc docking analysis of the available tcr structures in light of these results highlights the significance of the v  v  interdomain angle in determining specificity and indicates that tcr pmhc interface features do not distinguish autoimmune from non autoimmune class ii restricted tcrs
