the crystal structure of dtdp d glucose   dehydratase rmlb from salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium the second enzyme in the dtdp l rhamnose pathway edited by r huber
l rhamnose is a  deoxyhexose that is found in a variety of different glycoconjugates in the cell walls of pathogenic bacteria the precursor of l rhamnose is dtdp l rhamnose which is synthesised from glucose  phosphate and deoxythymidine triphosphate dttp via a pathway requiring four enzymes significantly this pathway does not exist in humans and all four enzymes therefore represent potential therapeutic targets dtdp d glucose   dehydratase rmlb ec      is the second enzyme in the dtdp l rhamnose biosynthetic pathway the structure of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium rmlb had been determined to     resolution with its cofactor nad bound the structure has been refined to a crystallographic r factor of    and an r free value of    with good stereochemistry rmlb functions as a homodimer with monomer association occurring principally through hydrophobic interactions via a four helix bundle each monomer exhibits an    structure that can be divided into two domains the larger n terminal domain binds the nucleotide cofactor nad and consists of a seven stranded  sheet surrounded by  helices the smaller c terminal domain is responsible for binding the sugar substrate dtdp d glucose and contains four  strands and six  helices the two domains meet to form a cavity in the enzyme the highly conserved active site tyr   xxxlys   catalytic couple and the glyxglyxxgly motif at the n terminus characterise rmlb as a member of the short chain dehydrogenase reductase extended family the quaternary structure of rmlb and its similarity to a number of other closely related short chain dehydrogenase reductase enzymes have enabled us to propose a mechanism of catalysis for this important enzyme
