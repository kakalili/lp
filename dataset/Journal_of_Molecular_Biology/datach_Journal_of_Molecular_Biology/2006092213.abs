diabetes mellitus due to misfolding of a  cell transcription factor stereospecific frustration of a schellman motif in hnf
maturity onset diabetes of the young mody  a monogenic form of type ii diabetes mellitus results most commonly from mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factor    hnf    diabetes associated mutation g r perturbs the dimerization domain of hnf    an intertwined four helix bundle in the wild type structure g  participates in a schellman motif to cap an  helix its dihedral angles lie in the right side of the ramachandran plot  l region      substitutions g r and g a lead to dimeric molten globules of low stability suggesting that the impaired function of the diabetes associated transcription factor is due in large part to a main chain perturbation rather than to specific features of the arg side chain this hypothesis is supported by the enhanced stability of non standard analogues containing d ala or d ser at position   the crystal structure of the d ala  analogue determined to a resolution of     is essentially identical to the wild type structure in the same crystal form the mean root mean square deviation between equivalent c  atoms residues     is          angles of d ala  are the same as those of g  in the wild type structure whereas the side chain of a  or r  would be expected to clash with the preceding carbonyl oxygen thus accounting for its frustrated energy landscape  the side chain of d ala  projects into solvent without perturbation of the schellman motif calorimetric studies indicate that the increased stability of the d ala  analogue   gu   kcal mol is entropic in origin consistent with a conformational bias toward native like conformations in the unfolded state studies of multiple substitutions at g  and neighboring positions highlight the essential contributions of a glycine specific tight turn and adjoining inter subunit side chain hydrogen bonds to the stability and architectural specificity of the intertwined dimer comparison of l and d amino acid substitutions thus provides an example of the stereospecific control of an energy landscape by a helix capping residue
