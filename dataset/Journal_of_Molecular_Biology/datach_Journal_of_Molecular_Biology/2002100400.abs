hepatocyte nuclear factor   controls renal expression of the npt npt anionic transporter locus
hepatocyte nuclear factor    hnf   is a transcription factor that is expressed in liver pancreas kidney and intestine mice lacking hnf  are born normally but suffer from several defects including hyperphenylalaninemia defective bile acid and cholesterol metabolism an insulin secretion defect and renal fanconi syndrome the renal phenotype involves a defect in renal proximal tubule reabsorption leading to polyuria glucosuria aminoaciduria and phosphaturia we investigated the expression of genes encoding members of the sodium phosphate cotransporter na pi family namely npt  npt  npt and ram  we show that npt and npt genes were expressed at reduced levels in the kidneys of hnf      mice whereas the expression of npt  the major renal phosphate transporter was not affected analysis of the npt genomic sequence revealed the existence of several alternative promoters activated in liver and or in kidney all of these were down regulated in the kidneys of hnf      animals several hnf  binding sites bs play an important role in the transcriptional control of this locus including low affinity hnf bss localised in a dnase i hypersensitivity site hss  transient transfection experiments confirmed that hnf  directly transactivates the npt promoter and that the hss region contributes to this activation
