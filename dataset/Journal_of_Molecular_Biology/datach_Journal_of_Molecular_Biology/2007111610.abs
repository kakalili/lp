gal p dosage compensates transcriptional activator deletions via taf p
transcriptional activators work by recruiting transcription factors that are required for the process of transcription to their target genes we have used the split ubiquitin system to identify eight transcription factors that interacted with both the transcriptional activators gal p and gcn p in living cells the over expression of one of the activator interacting proteins gal p partially suppressed gal and gcn deletions we have isolated two point mutants in gal p f  l and f  s that were defective for the dosage compensation we have identified  transcription factors that interacted with gal p in living cells and the only protein  protein interaction affected by the gal p mutations was the one between gal p and taf p we have further shown that the suppression of a gal deletion by high levels of gal p required taf p and that over expression of gal p recruited taf p to the gal promoter together with tbp p swi p and srb p gal p interacted with mig p indicating that mig  p could have recruited gal p to the gal promoter in the absence of gal p our results suggest that transcriptional activators work by raising the local concentration of the limiting factor gal p and that gal p works by recruiting mediator and taf p containing transcription factors like tfiid and swi snf and by competing general repressors like ssn p tup p off the target promoters
