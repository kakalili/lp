identification and characterization of the chromatin binding domains of the hiv  integrase interactor ledgf p
depletion of the transcriptional co activator ledgf p  by rna interference alters the genome wide pattern of hiv  integration reducing integration into active genes reducing integration into ledgf p  regulated genes and increasing integration into g c rich sequences ledgf p  is also able to act as a molecular tether linking hiv  integrase protein to chromatin a phenomenon likely to underlie the integration site distribution effects the ledgf p  integrase binding domain has been established but the domain or domains responsible for the chromatin binding component of tethering are unknown here we identify and characterize these domains complementary methods were used to assess condensed and uncondensed chromatin and to determine the stringency of chromatin binding immuno localization analyses revealed that an n terminal pwwp domain and its  barrel substructure are needed for binding to metaphase chromatin however the pwwp domain is insufficient to transfer metaphase chromatin binding to green fluorescent protein which requires addition of a downstream charged region cr  biochemical analysis showed that full length ledgf p  resists triton x   extraction from chromatin to transfer triton resistant chromatin binding to green fluorescent protein pwwp cr is necessary but not sufficient further inclusion of a tandem pair of at hooks in combination with at least one of two identified downstream charged regions cr or cr  is needed deletion of just the pwwp or the at hook domain from full length ledgf p  reduced triton resistant chromatin binding while deletion of both elements abolished it underscoring their dominant and cooperative role the results establish a molecular mechanism for ledgf p  mediated tethering of hiv  integrase to chromatin
