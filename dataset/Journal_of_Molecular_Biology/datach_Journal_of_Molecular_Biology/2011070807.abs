mitochondrial aminoacyl trna synthetase single nucleotide polymorphisms that lead to defects in refolding but not aminoacylation
defects in organellar translation are the underlying cause of a number of mitochondrial diseases including diabetes deafness encephalopathy and other mitochondrial myopathies the most common causes of these diseases are mutations in mitochondria encoded trnas it has recently become apparent that mutations in nuclear encoded components of the mitochondrial translation machinery such as aminoacyl trna synthetases aarss  can also lead to disease in some cases mutations can be directly linked to losses in enzymatic activity however for many their effect is unknown to investigate how aars mutations impact function without changing enzymatic activity we chose nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms nssnps that encode residues distal from the active site of human mitochondrial phenylalanyl trna synthetase the phenylalanyl trna synthetase variants s c and n  s both displayed wild type aminoacylation activity and stability with respect to their free energies of unfolding but were less stable at low ph mitochondrial proteins undergo partial unfolding refolding during import and both s c and n  s variants retained less activity than wild type after refolding consistent with their reduced stability at low ph to examine possible defects in protein folding in other aars nssnps we compared the refolding of the human mitochondrial leucyl trna synthetase variant h  q to that of wild type the h  q variant had normal activity prior to unfolding but displayed a refolding defect resulting in reduced aminoacylation compared to wild type after renaturation these data show that nssnps can impact mitochondrial translation by changing a biophysical property of a protein in this case refolding without affecting the corresponding enzymatic activity
