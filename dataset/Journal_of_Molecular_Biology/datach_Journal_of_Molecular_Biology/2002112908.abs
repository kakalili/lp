pvuii endonuclease induces structural alterations at the scissile phosphate group of its cognate dna
we investigated the pvuii endonuclease with its cognate dna by means of molecular dynamics simulations comparing the complexed dna with a reference simulation of free dna we saw structural changes at the scissile phosphodiester bond at this gpc step the enzyme induces the highest twist and axial rise inclination is increased and the minor groove widened the distance between the scissile phosphate group and the phosphate group of the following thymine base is shortened significantly indicating a substrate assisted catalysis a feasible reason for this vicinity is the catalytically important amino acid residue lysine   which bridges the free oxygen atoms of the successive phosphate groups due to this geometry a compact reaction pocket is formed where a water molecule can be held thus bringing the reaction partners for hydrolysis into contact the o  p  o angle of the scissile nucleotide is decreased probably due to a complexation of the negative oxygen atoms through protein and solvent contacts
