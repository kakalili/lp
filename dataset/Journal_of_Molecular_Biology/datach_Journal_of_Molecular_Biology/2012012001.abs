crystal structure of human mitochondrial phers complexed with trnaphe in the active  open  state
monomeric human mitochondrial phenylalanyl trna synthetase phers  or hmphers is the smallest known enzyme exhibiting aminoacylation activity hmphers consists of only two structural domains and differs markedly from heterodimeric eukaryotic cytosolic and bacterial analogs both in the domain organization and in the mode of trna binding here we describe the first crystal structure of mitochondrial aminoacyl trna synthetase aars complexed with trna at a resolution of     unlike bacterial pherss the hmphers recognizes c  the g  c  base pair and the  discriminator  base a  proposed to contribute to trnaphe identity in the yeast mitochondrial enzyme an interaction of the trna acceptor stem with the signature motif  residues of hmphers is of critical importance for the stabilization of the cca extended conformation and its correct placement in the synthetic site of the enzyme the crystal structure of hmphers  trnaphe provides direct evidence that the formation of the complex with trna requires a significant rearrangement of the anticodon binding domain from the  closed  to the productive  open  state global repositioning of the domain is trna modulated and governed by long range electrostatic interactions
