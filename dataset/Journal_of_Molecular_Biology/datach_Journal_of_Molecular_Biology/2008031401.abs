nmr analysis of partially folded states and persistent structure in the alpha subunit of tryptophan synthase implications for the equilibrium folding mechanism of a  kda tim barrel protein
structural insights into the equilibrium folding mechanism of the alpha subunit of tryptophan synthase  ts from escherichia coli a     tim barrel protein were obtained with a pair of complementary nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopic techniques the secondary structures of rare high energy partially folded states were probed by native state hydrogen exchange nmr analysis of main chain amide hydrogens  d heteronuclear single quantum coherence nmr analysis of several  n labeled nonpolar amino acids was used to probe the side chains involved in stabilizing a highly denatured intermediate that is devoid of secondary structure the dynamic broadening of a subset of isoleucine and leucine side chains and the absence of protection against exchange showed that the highest energy folded state on the free energy landscape is stabilized by a hydrophobic cluster lacking stable secondary structure the core of this cluster centered near the n terminus of  ts serves as a nucleus for the stabilization of what appears to be nonnative secondary structure in a marginally stable intermediate the progressive decrease in protection against exchange from this nucleus toward both termini and from the n termini to the c termini of several  strands is best described by an ensemble of weakly coupled conformers comparison with previous data strongly suggests that this ensemble corresponds to a marginally stable off pathway intermediate that arises in the first few milliseconds of folding and persists under equilibrium conditions a second more stable intermediate which has an intact  barrel and a frayed  helical shell coexists with this marginally stable species the conversion of the more stable intermediate to the native state of  ts entails the formation of a stable helical shell and completes the acquisition of the tertiary structure
