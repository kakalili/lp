identification of critical residues for the tight binding of both correct and incorrect nucleotides to human dna polymerase
dna polymerase   pol   is a novel x family dna polymerase that shares   sequence identity with dna polymerase   pre steady state kinetic studies have shown that the pol   dna complex binds both correct and incorrect nucleotides   fold tighter on average than the dna polymerase   dna complex although the base substitution fidelity of both polymerases is    to     to better understand pol  s tight nucleotide binding affinity we created single substitution and double substitution mutants of pol  to disrupt the interactions between active site residues and an incoming nucleotide or a template base single turnover kinetic assays showed that pol  binds to an incoming nucleotide via cooperative interactions with active site residues r   r   k   y   f   a   and r   disrupting protein interactions with an incoming correct or incorrect nucleotide impacted binding to each of the common structural moieties in the following order triphosphate  base gt ribose in addition the loss of watson  crick hydrogen bonding between the nucleotide and the template base led to a moderate increase in kd the fidelity of pol  was maintained predominantly by a single residue r   which has minor groove interactions with the dna template
