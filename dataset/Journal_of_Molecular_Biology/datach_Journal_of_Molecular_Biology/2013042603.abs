proteins and domains vary in their tolerance of non synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms nssnps
the widespread application of whole genome sequencing is identifying numerous non synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms nssnps  many of which are associated with disease we analyzed nssnps from humsavar and the   genomes project to investigate why some proteins and domains are more tolerant of mutations than others we identified   proteins and   pfam families corresponding to   domains as disease susceptible and  proteins and  pfam families     domains as disease resistant based on the relative numbers of disease associated and neutral polymorphisms proteins with no significant difference from expected numbers of disease and polymorphism nssnps are classified as other this classification takes into account the phenotypes of all known mutations in the protein or domain rather than simply classifying based on the presence or absence of disease nssnps of the two hypotheses suggested our results support the model that disease resistant domains and proteins are more able to tolerate mutations rather than having more lethal mutations that are not observed disease resistant proteins and domains show significantly higher mutation rates and lower sequence conservation than disease susceptible proteins and domains disease susceptible proteins are more likely to be encoded by essential genes are more central in protein  protein interaction networks and are less likely to contain loss of function mutations in healthy individuals we use this classification for nssnp phenotype prediction predicting nssnps in disease susceptible domains to be disease and those in disease resistant domains to be polymorphism in this way we achieve higher accuracy than sift a state of the art algorithm
