folding kinetics of the cooperatively folded subdomain of the i b  ankyrin repeat domain
the ankyrin repeat ar domain of i b  consists of a cooperative folding unit of roughly four ars ar  ar  and of two weakly folded repeats ar and ar  the kinetic folding mechanism of the cooperative subdomain i b     was analyzed using rapid mixing techniques despite its apparent architectural simplicity i b     displays complex folding kinetics with two sequential on pathway high energy intermediates the effect of mutations to or away from the consensus sequences of ars on folding behavior was analyzed particularly the gxtplhla motif which have not been examined in detail previously mutations toward the consensus generally resulted in an increase in folding stability whereas mutations away from the consensus resulted in decreased overall stability we determined the free energy change upon mutation for three sequential transition state ensembles along the folding route for  mutants we show that folding initiates with the formation of the interface of the outer helices of ar and ar  and then proceeds to consolidate structure in these repeats subsequently ar and ar fold in a concerted way in a single kinetic step we show that this mechanism is robust to the presence of ar and ar as they do not strongly affect the folding kinetics overall the protein appears to fold on a rather smooth energy landscape where the folding mechanism conforms a one dimensional approximation however we note that the ar does not necessarily act as a single folding element
