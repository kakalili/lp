multi timescale dynamics study of fkbp  along the rapamycin  mtor binding coordinate
drugs can affect function in proteins by modulating their flexibility despite this possibility there are very few studies on how drug binding affects the dynamics of target macromolecules fkbp  fk  binding protein   is a prolyl cis  trans isomerase and a drug target the immunosuppressant drug rapamycin exerts its therapeutic effect by serving as an adaptor molecule between fkbp  and the cell proliferation regulator mtor mammalian target of rapamycin  to understand the role of dynamics in rapamycin based immunosuppression and to gain insight into the role of dynamics in the assembly of supramolecular complexes we used  n  c and h nmr spin relaxation to characterize fkbp  along the binding coordinate that leads to cell cycle arrest we show that sequential addition of rapamycin and mtor leads to incremental rigidification of the fkbp  backbone on the picosecond nanosecond timescale both binding events lead to perturbation of main chain and side chain dynamics at sites distal to the binding interfaces suggesting tight coupling interactions dispersed throughout the fkbp   rapamycin interface binding of the first molecule rapamycin quenches microsecond millisecond motions of the fkbp   s loop this loop provides much of the surface buried at the protein  protein interface of the ternary complex leading us to assert that preorganization upon rapamycin binding facilitates binding of the second molecule mtor widespread microsecond millisecond motions of the backbone persist in the drug bound enzyme and we provide evidence that these slow motions represent coupled dynamics of the enzyme and isomerization of the bound drug finally the pattern of microsecond millisecond dynamics reported here in the rapamycin complex is dramatically different from the pattern in the complex with the structurally related drug fk   this raises the important question of how two complexes that are highly isomorphic based on high resolution static models have such different flexibilities in solution
