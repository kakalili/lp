rad  interaction with the proteasome is regulated by phosphorylation of its ubiquitin like ubl domain
rad  was identified as a dna repair protein although a role in protein degradation has been described the protein degradation function of rad  contributes to cell cycle progression stress response endoplasmic reticulum proteolysis and dna repair rad  binds the proteasome through a ubl ubiquitin like domain and contains uba ubiquitin associated motifs that bind multiubiquitin chains these domains allow rad  to function as a substrate shuttle factor this property is shared by structurally similar proteins dsk and ddi  and is conserved among the human and mouse counterparts of rad  despite much effort the regulation of rad  interactions with ubiquitinated substrates and the proteasome is unknown we report here that rad  is extensively phosphorylated in vivo and in vitro serine residues in ubl are phosphorylated and influence rad  interaction with proteasomes replacement of these serine residues with acidic residues to mimic phosphorylation reduced proteasome binding we reported that when ubl is overexpressed it can compete with rad  for proteasome interaction and can inhibit substrate turnover this effect is not observed with ubl containing acidic substitutions consistent with results that phosphorylation inhibits interaction with the proteasome loss of both rad  and rpn  caused pleiotropic defects that were suppressed by overexpressing either rad  or rpn  rad  bearing a ubl domain with acidic substitutions failed to suppress rad   rpn   confirming the importance of regulated rad  proteasome binding strikingly threonine  in human hr b also regulates interaction with the proteasome suggesting that phosphorylation is a conserved mechanism for controlling rad  proteasome interaction
