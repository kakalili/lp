identification and characterization of a novel periplasmic polygalacturonic acid binding protein from yersinia enterolitica
a number of bacteria in the family enterobacteriaceae harbor the genes comprising well developed pectinolytic pathways e g erwinia sp  or abridged versions of this pathway e g yersinia sp  one of the most enigmatic components present in some of these pathways is a small gene that encodes a predicted secreted protein of    amino acid residues with unknown function this protein shows distant amino acid sequence similarity over its entire length to galactose specific family  carbohydrate binding modules cbms  here we demonstrate the ability of the yersinia enterocolitica example here called yecbm  to bind polygalacturonic acid containing components of pectin this binding is selective for highly polymerized galacturonic acid and shows a complex mode of polysaccharide recognition the high resolution x ray crystal structure      shows yecbm s overall structural similarity to galactose specific cbms and conserved binding site location but reveals a substantially different binding site topology which likely reflects its unique polymeric and acidic ligand the results suggest the possibility of a unique role for yecbm  in polygalacturonic acid transport
