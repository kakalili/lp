mechanism of thermostabilization in a designed cold shock protein with optimized surface electrostatic interactions
using computational and sequence analysis of bacterial cold shock proteins we designed a protein cspb tb that has the core residues of mesophilic protein from bacillus subtilis cspb bs and altered distribution of surface charged residues this designed protein was characterized by circular dichroism spectroscopy and found to have secondary and tertiary structure similar to that of cspb bs the activity of the cspb tb protein as measured by the affinity to a single stranded dna ssdna template at   c is somewhat higher than that of cspb bs furthermore the decrease in the apparent binding constant to ssdna upon increase in temperature is much more pronounced for cspb bs than for cspb tb temperature induced unfolding as monitored by differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroism spectroscopy and urea induced unfolding experiments were used to compare the stabilities of cspb bs and cspb tb it was found that cspb tb is   deg c more thermostable than cspb bs the thermostabilization of cspb tb relative to cspb bs is achieved by decrease in the enthalpy and entropy of unfolding without affecting their temperature dependencies i e these proteins have similar heat capacity changes upon unfolding these changes in the thermodynamic parameters result in the global stability function i e gibbs energy  g t  that is shifted to higher temperatures with only small changes in the maximum stability such a mechanism of thermostabilization although predicted from the basic thermodynamic considerations has never been identified experimentally
