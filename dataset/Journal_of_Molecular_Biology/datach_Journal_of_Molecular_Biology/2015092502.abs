highly collapsed conformation of the initial folding intermediates of  lactoglobulin with non native  helix
in the folding of  lactoglobulin  lg  a predominantly  sheet protein a transient intermediate possessing an excess amount of non native  helix is formed within a few milliseconds to characterize the early folding dynamics of  lg in terms of secondary structure content and compactness we performed submillisecond resolved circular dichroism cd and small angle x ray scattering saxs measurements time resolved cd after rapid dilution of urea showed non native  helix formation within   s time resolved saxs showed that the radius of gyration rg of the intermediate at   s was       indicating a considerable collapse from the unfolded state having rg of       further compaction to rg of       occurred with a time constant of    ms pair distribution functions showed that the intermediate at   s comprises a single collapsed domain with a small fluctuating domain which becomes more compact after the second collapse kinetic measurements in the presence of    trifluoroethanol showed that the intermediate at several milliseconds possessed an increased amount of  helix but similar rg of       suggesting similarity of the shape of the intermediate in different solvents consequently the initial collapse occurs globally to a compact state with a small fluctuating domain irrespective of the non native  helical contents the second collapse of the fluctuating domain occurs in accordance with the reported stabilization of the non native helix around strand a the non native helix around strand a might facilitate the formation of long range contacts required for the folding of  lg
