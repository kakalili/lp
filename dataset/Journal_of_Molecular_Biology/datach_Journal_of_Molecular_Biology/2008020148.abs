in crystallo capture of a michaelis complex and product binding modes of a bacterial phosphotriesterase
the mechanism by which the binuclear metallophosphotriesterases ptes e c      catalyse substrate hydrolysis has been extensively studied the  hydroxo bridge between the metal ions has been proposed to be the initiating nucleophile in the hydrolytic reaction in contrast analysis of some biomimetic systems has indicated that  hydroxo bridges are often not themselves nucleophiles but act as general bases for freely exchangeable nucleophilic water molecules herein we present crystallographic analyses of a bacterial pte from agrobacterium radiobacter opda capturing the enzyme  substrate complex during hydrolysis this model of the michaelis complex suggests the alignment of the substrate will favour attack from a solvent molecule terminally coordinated to the  metal ion the bridging of both metal ions by the product without disruption of the  hydroxo bridge is also consistent with nucleophilic attack occurring from the terminal position when phosphodiesters are soaked into crystals of opda they coordinate bidentately to the  metal ion displacing the  hydroxo bridge thus alternative product binding modes exist for the ptes and it is the bridging mode that appears to result from phosphotriester hydrolysis kinetic analysis of the pte and promiscuous phosphodiesterase activities confirms that the presence of a  hydroxo bridge during phosphotriester hydrolysis is correlated with a lower pka for the nucleophile consistent with a general base function during catalysis
