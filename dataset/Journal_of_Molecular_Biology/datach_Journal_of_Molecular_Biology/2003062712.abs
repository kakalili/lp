the active conformation of glutamate synthase and its binding to ferredoxin
glutamate synthases glts are crucial enzymes in ammonia assimilation in plants and bacteria where they catalyze the formation of two molecules of l glutamate from l glutamine and  oxoglutarate the plant type ferredoxin dependent glts and the functionally homologous  subunit of the bacterial nadph dependent glts are complex four domain monomeric enzymes of      kda belonging to the nh terminal nucleophile family of amidotransferases the enzymes function through the channeling of ammonia from the n terminal amidotransferase domain to the fmn binding domain here we report the x ray structure of the synechocystis ferredoxin dependent glts with the substrate  oxoglutarate and the covalent inhibitor  oxo l norleucine bound in their physically distinct active sites solved using a new crystal form the covalent cys  oxo l norleucine adduct mimics the glutamyl thioester intermediate formed during l glutamine hydrolysis moreover we determined a high resolution structure of the glts  oxoglutarate complex these structures represent the enzyme in the active conformation by comparing these structures with that of glts  subunit and of related enzymes we propose a mechanism for enzyme self regulation and ammonia channeling between the active sites x ray small angle scattering experiments were performed on solutions containing glts and its physiological electron donor ferredoxin fd  using the structure of glts and the newly determined crystal structure of synechocystis fd the scattering experiments clearly showed that glts forms an equimolar    complex with fd a fundamental consequence of this result is that two fd molecules bind consecutively to fd glts to yield the reduced fmn cofactor during catalysis
