structure  function analysis of enoyl thioester reductase involved in mitochondrial maintenance
candida tropicalis enoyl thioester reductase etr p and the saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue mrf p catalyse the nadph dependent reduction of trans  enoyl thioesters in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis fas  unlike prokaryotic enoyl thioester reductases etrs  which belong to the short chain dehydrogenases reductases sdr  etr p and mrf p represent structurally distinguishable etrs that belong to the medium chain dehydrogenases reductases mdr superfamily indicating independent origin of two separate classes of etrs the crystal structures of etr p the etr p nadph complex and the etr y np mutant were refined to        and    resolution respectively the native fold of etr p was maintained in etr y np but the mutant had only   of etr p catalytic activity remaining and failed to rescue the respiratory deficient phenotype of the mrf  strain mutagenesis of tyr  in mrf p corresponding to tyr  in etr p produced similar results our data indicate that the mitochondrial reductase activity is indispensable for respiratory function in yeast emphasizing the significance of mrf p etr p and mitochondrial fas for the integrity of the respiratory competent organelle
