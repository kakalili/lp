genomes and g quadruplexes for better or for worse
genomic integrity is crucial for correct chromosome segregation and physiological rates of cell proliferation mutations deletions and translocations hallmarks of human tumors drive the aberrant proliferation and metastatic behavior of cancer cells these chromosomal rearrangements often occur at genomic sites susceptible to breakage during dna replication including regions with g quadruplex g  forming potential g s are stable secondary structures that guanine rich single stranded dna can readily adopt in vitro however their formation in eukaryotic cells has remained elusive and thus a subject of debate ever since they were first described recent work has more convincingly implicated g s in a variety of biological processes including telomere maintenance gene expression epigenetic regulation and dna replication however the downside of employing thermodynamically very stable alternative dna structures as regulatory entities lies in their potential to also interfere with normal dna metabolic processes such as transcription and replication which require readability of each base to faithfully transmit genetic information indeed it has become clear that g structures can pose prominent barriers to replication fork progression and that they are also intrinsically recombinogenic here we discuss mechanisms that cells evolved to counteract these detrimental effects thereby ensuring the faithful inheritance of g containing genomes
