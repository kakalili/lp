the solution structure of the loop e region of the s rrna from spinach chloroplasts
a structure has been obtained for the loop e region of the s rrna from spinacia oleracia chloroplast ribosomes using residual dipolar coupling data as well as noe j coupling and chemical shift information even though the loop e sequence of this chloroplast s rrna differs from that of escherichia coli loop e at    of its positions its conformation is remarkably similar to that of e coli loop e consistent with this conclusion ribosomal protein l  from e coli which binds to the loop e region of both intact e coli s rrna and to oligonucleotides containing that sequence also binds to the chloroplast derived oligonucleotide discussed here
