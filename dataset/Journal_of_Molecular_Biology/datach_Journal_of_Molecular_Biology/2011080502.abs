generation of bivalent and bispecific kringle single domains by loop grafting as potent agonists against death receptors  and
bivalent or bispecific binding activity of proteins has been mainly achieved by assembling two or more domains in a single molecule here we report bivalent bispecific single domain proteins based on the kringle domain kd  which has a cystine knot structural motif and is highly tolerant of sequence modifications kd has seven loops protruding from the core fold into two largely opposite directions dubbed loop cluster regions lcrs  and  mutational analysis of previously isolated agonistic kd variants against human death receptors drs  and  revealed that they can simultaneously recognize two target molecules of dr and or dr via the two independent binding sites of lcr and lcr  binding loop mapping of yeast surface displayed kd mutants identified high affinity target binding loops in lcr  which were then grafted into conformationally compatible loops located on the opposite side of lcr within the same or different kd variants to generate bivalent bispecific kd variants against dr and or dr with improved affinity the loop grafted bivalent bispecific kd variants showed enhanced cell death inducing activity of tumor cells compared with their monovalent monospecific and bivalent monospecific counterparts demonstrating an advantage of bispecific targeting to both dr and dr over the targeting of only one of the two pro apoptotic receptors our results suggest that the kd with the two independent binding surfaces for target recognition is an appropriate scaffold for the development of bivalency and or bispecificity by loop grafting on the single domain which offers a distinct advantage over other protein scaffolds with a single binding surface
