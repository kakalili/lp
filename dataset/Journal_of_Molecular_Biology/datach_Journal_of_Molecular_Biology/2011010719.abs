biogenesis of mitochondria dual role of tom in modulating assembly of the preprotein translocase of the outer membrane
biogenesis of the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane tom complex involves the assembly of the central  barrel forming protein tom  with six different subunits that are embedded in the membrane via  helical transmembrane segments the sorting and assembly machinery sam complex of the outer membrane plays a central role in this process the sam complex mediates the membrane integration of  barrel precursor proteins including tom  the small tom proteins tom and tom associate with the precursor of tom  at the sam complex at an early stage of the assembly process and play a stimulatory role in the formation of the mature tom complex a fraction of the sam components interacts with the outer membrane protein mitochondrial distribution and morphology protein   mdm  to form the sam  mdm  machinery however different views exist on the function of the sam  mdm  complex we report here that the third small tom protein tom  plays an inhibitory role at two distinct steps in the biogenesis of the tom complex first tom plays an antagonistic role to tom and tom at the early stage of tom  assembly at the sam complex second tom interacts with mdm  that is not bound to the sam complex and thus promotes dissociation of the sam  mdm  complex since the sam  mdm  complex is required for the biogenesis of tom  tom delays the assembly of tom  with tom  at a late stage of assembly of the tom complex thus tom modulates the biogenesis of topologically different proteins the  barrel forming protein tom  and tom  that contains a transmembrane  helix
