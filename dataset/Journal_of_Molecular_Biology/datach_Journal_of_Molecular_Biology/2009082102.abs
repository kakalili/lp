conformational adaptability of red  during dna annealing and implications for its structural relationship with rad
single strand annealing proteins such as red  from  phage or eukaryotic rad  play roles in homologous recombination here we use atomic force microscopy to examine red  quaternary structure and red   dna complexes in the absence of dna red  forms a shallow right handed helix the presence of single stranded dna ssdna disrupts this structure upon addition of a second complementary ssdna annealing generates a left handed helix that incorporates  red  monomers per helical turn with each red  monomer annealing    bp of dna the smallest stable annealing intermediate requires   bp dna and two red  monomers hence we propose that red  promotes base pairing by first increasing the number of transient interactions between ssdnas then annealing is promoted by the binding of a second red  monomer which nucleates the formation of a stable annealing intermediate using threading we identify sequence similarities between the rect red  and the rad  families which strengthens previous suggestions based on similarities of their quaternary structures that they share a common mode of action hence our findings have implications for a common mechanism of dna annealing mediated by single strand annealing proteins including rad
