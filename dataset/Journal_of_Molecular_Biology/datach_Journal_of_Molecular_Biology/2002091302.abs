dependence of  synuclein aggregate morphology on solution conditions
synuclein is the major component of lewy bodies and lewy neurites which are granular and filamentous protein inclusions that are the defining pathological features of several neurodegenerative conditions such as parkinson s disease fibrillar aggregates formed from  synuclein in vitro resemble brain derived material but the role of such aggregates in the etiology of parkinson s disease and their relation to the toxic molecular species remain unclear in this study we investigated the effects of ph and salt concentration on the in vitro assembly of human wild type  synuclein particularly with regard to aggregation rate and aggregate morphology aggregates formed at ph   and ph   in the absence of nacl and mgcl were fibrillar the ph   fibrils displayed a helical twist as clearly evident by scanning force and electron microscopy incubations at ph   remained transparent during the process of aggregation and exhibited strong thioflavin t and weak  anilino  naphthalenesulfonate ans binding furthermore they were efficient in seeding fibrillization of fresh solutions in contrast incubating  synuclein at low ph ph   or ph   resulted in the rapid formation of turbid suspensions characterized by strong ans binding reduced thioflavin t binding and reduced seeding efficiency at ph   fibril formation was abrogated instead very large aggregates dimensions     m of amorphous appearance were visible by light microscopy as with acidic conditions addition of  m nacl or  mm mgcl to ph   incubations led to a shorter aggregation lag time and formation of large amorphous aggregates these results demonstrate that the morphology of  synuclein aggregates is highly sensitive to solution conditions implying that the fibrillar state does not necessarily represent the predominant or most functionally significant aggregated state under physiological conditions
