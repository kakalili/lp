activation mechanisms of transcriptional regulator cooa revealed by small angle x ray scattering
cooa a heme containing transcriptional activator binds co to the heme moiety and then undergoes a structural change that promotes the specific binding to the target dna to elucidate the activation mechanism coupled to co binding we investigated the co dependent structural transition of cooa with small angle x ray scattering saxs  in the absence of co the radius of gyration rg and the second virial coefficient a  were        and            mlmolg   respectively co binding caused a slight increase in rg by    and a marked decrease in a  by       mlmolg    the observed decrease in a points to higher attractive interactions between co bound cooa molecules in solution compared with co free cooa although the minor alternation of rg rules out changes in the overall structure the marked change in the surface properties points to a co induced conformational transition the experimental rg and saxs curves of the two states did not agree with the crystal structure of co free cooa we thus simulated the solution structures of cooa based on the experimental data using rigid body refinements as well as low resolution model reconstructions both results demonstrate that the hinge region connecting the n terminal heme domain and c terminal dna binding domain is kinked in co free cooa so that the two domains are positioned close to each other the co dependent structural change observed by saxs corresponds to a slight swing of the dna binding domains away from the heme domains coupled with their rotation by about   around the axis of  fold symmetry
