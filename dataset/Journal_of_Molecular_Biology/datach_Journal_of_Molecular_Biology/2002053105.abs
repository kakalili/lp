structural characterization of the reaction pathway in phosphoserine phosphatase crystallographic  snapshots  of intermediate states
phosphoserine phosphatase psp is a member of a large class of enzymes that catalyze phosphoester hydrolysis using a phosphoaspartate  enzyme intermediate psp is a likely regulator of the steady state d serine level in the brain which is a critical co agonist of the n methyl d aspartate type of glutamate receptors here we present high resolution        structures of psp from methanococcus jannaschii which define the open state prior to substrate binding the complex with phosphoserine substrate bound with a d to n mutation in the active site  and the complex with alf  a transition state analog for the phospho transfer steps in the reaction these structures together with those described for the bef   complex mimicking the phospho enzyme and the enzyme with phosphate product in the active site provide a detailed structural picture of the full reaction cycle the structure of the apo state indicates partial unfolding of the enzyme to allow substrate binding with refolding in the presence of substrate to provide specificity interdomain and active site conformational changes are identified the structure with the transition state analog bound indicates a  tight  intermediate a striking structure homology with significant sequence conservation among psp p type atpases and response regulators suggests that the knowledge of the psp reaction mechanism from the structures determined will provide insights into the reaction mechanisms of the other enzymes in this family
