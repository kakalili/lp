multiple roles of heparin in the aggregation of p
the   residue protein p   stimulates the fibrillation of  synuclein  sn in vitro and colocalizes with it in several  synucleinopathies although p   does not fibrillate by itself under native conditions in vitro  sn free p   aggregates have also been observed in vivo in for example multiple system atrophy to investigate which environmental conditions might trigger this aggregation we investigated the effect of polyanionic biomolecules on p   aggregation heparin polyglutamate arachidonic acid micelles and rna all induce p   aggregation more detailed studies using heparin as template for aggregation reveal that a minimum of     heparin monosaccharide units per heparin polymer are required bona fide fibrils are only formed at intermediate heparin concentrations possibly because an excess of heparin binding sites blocks the inter p   contacts required for amyloid formation other polyanions also show an optimum for amyloid formation aggregation involves only modest structural changes according to both spectroscopic and proteolytic experiments the aggregates do not seed aggregation of heparin free p   suggesting that heparin is required in stoichiometric amounts to form organized structures we are able to reproduce these observations in a model involving two levels of binding of p   to heparin we conclude that the modest structural changes that p   undergoes can promote weak intermolecular contacts and that polyanions such as heparin play a central role in stabilizing these aggregates but in multiple ways leading to different types of aggregates this highlights the role of non protein components in promoting protein aggregation in vivo
