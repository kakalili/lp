an a type double helix of dna having b type puckering of the deoxyribose rings edited by i tinoco
dna usually adopts structure b in aqueous solution while structure a is preferred in mixtures of trifluoroethanol tfe with water however the octamer d ccccgggg and other d cngn fragments of dna provide cd spectra that suggest that the base pairs are stacked in an a like fashion even in aqueous solution yet d ccccgggg undergoes a cooperative tfe induced transition into structure a indicating that an important part of the aqueous duplex retains structure b nmr spectroscopy shows that puckering of the deoxyribose rings is of the b type hence combination of the information provided by cd spectroscopy and nmr spectroscopy suggests an unprecedented double helix of dna in which a like base stacking is combined with b type puckering of the deoxyribose rings in order to determine whether this combination is possible we used molecular dynamics to simulate the duplex of d ccccgggg  remarkably the simulations completely unrestrained by the experimental data provided a very stable double helix of dna exhibiting just the intermediate b a features described above the double helix contained well stacked guanine bases but almost unstacked cytosine bases this generated a hole in the double helix center which is a property characteristic for a dna but absent from b dna the minor groove was narrow at the double helix ends but wide at the central cg step where the watson crick base pairs were buckled in opposite directions the base pairs stacked tightly at the ends but stacking was loose in the duplex center the present double helix in which a like base stacking is combined with b type sugar puckering is relevant to replication and transcription because both of these phenomena involve a local b to a transition
