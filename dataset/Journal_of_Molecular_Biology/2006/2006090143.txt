ErbB-2 is a member of the family of epidermal growth factor receptors, which shows an oncogenic mutation in the rat gene neu, Val664Glu in the transmembrane domain that causes permanent dimerisation and subsequently leads to uncontrollable cell division and tumour formation. We have obtained the α-helical structure of the mutant transmembrane domain dimer experimentally with site-specific infrared dichroism (SSID) based on six transmembrane peptides with 13C18O carbonyl group-labelled residues. The derived orientational data indicate a local helix tilt ranging from 28(±6)° to 22(±4)°. Altogether using orientational constraints from SSID and experimental α-helical constraints while performing a systematic conformational search including molecular dynamics simulation in a lipid bilayer, we have obtained a unique experimentally defined atomic structure. The resulting structure consists of a right handed α-helical bundle with the residues Ile659, Val663, Leu667, Ile671, Val674 and Leu679 in the dimerisation interface. The right-handed bundle is in contrast to the left-handed structures obtained in previous modelling efforts. In order to facilitate tight helical packing, the spacious Glu664 residues do not interact directly but with water molecules that enter the bilayer.
