allosteric communication network in the tetrameric restriction endonuclease bse  i
restriction endonuclease bse  i is a homotetramer arranged as a dimer of two primary dimers bse  i displays its maximum catalytic efficiency upon binding of two copies of cognate dna one per each primary dimer the catalytic activity of bse  i on a single dna copy is down regulated due to the cross talking interactions between the primary dimers the mechanism of signal propagation between the individual active sites of bse  i remains unclear to identify communication pathways involved in the catalytic activity regulation of bse  i tetramer we mutated a selected set of amino acid residues at the dimer  dimer interface and analysed the oligomeric state and catalytic properties of the mutant proteins we demonstrate that alanine replacement of n  and v  residues located in the loop at the tetramerisation interface did not inhibit tetramer assembly but dramatically altered the catalytic properties of bse  i despite of the distal location from the active site kinetic analysis using cognate hairpin oligonucleotide and one and two site plasmids as substrates allowed us to identify two types of communication signals propagated through the dimer dimer interface in the bse  i tetramer the inhibitory or  stopper  and the activating or  sync  signal we suggest that the interplay between the two signals determines the catalytic and regulatory properties of the bse  i and mutant proteins
