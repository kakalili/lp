two intramolecular isopeptide bonds are identified in the crystal structure of the streptococcus gordonii sspb c terminal domain
streptococcus gordonii is a primary colonizer and is involved in the formation of dental plaque this bacterium expresses several surface proteins one of them is the adhesin sspb which is a member of the antigen i ii family of proteins sspb is a large multi domain protein that has interactions with surface molecules on other bacteria and on host cells and is thus a key factor in the formation of biofilms here we report the crystal structure of a truncated form of the sspb c terminal domain solved by single wavelength anomalous dispersion to     resolution the structure represents the first of a c terminal domain from a streptococcal antigen i ii protein and is comprised of two structurally related  sandwich domains c and c  both with a ca  bound in equivalent positions in each of the domains a covalent isopeptide bond is observed between a lysine and an asparagine a feature that is believed to be a common stabilization mechanism in gram positive surface proteins s gordonii biofilms contain attachment sites for the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis and the sspb c terminal domain has been shown to have one such recognition motif the sspb adherence region the motif protrudes from the protein and serves as a handle for attachment the structure suggests several additional putative binding surfaces and other binding clefts may be created when the full length protein is folded
