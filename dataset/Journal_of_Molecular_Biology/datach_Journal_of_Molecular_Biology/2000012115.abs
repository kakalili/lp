a diamond shaped zipper like dna architecture containing triads sandwiched between mismatches and tetrads edited by p e wright
the present study reports on the solution structure of the guanine plus adenine rich d a g t a g   mer sequence which forms a unique fold in moderate nacl solution proton resonance assignments for this sequence which contains a pair of aagg repeats separated by a t linker segment were aided by site specific  n labeling of guanine and adenine bases as well as site specific incorporation of   diaminopurine and  bromoadenine for adenine  bromoguanine  deazaguanine and inosine for guanine and uracil and  bromouracil for thymine the solution structure which was solved by a combined nmr and intensity refined computational approach consists of a diamond shaped architecture formed through dimerization of a pair of d a g t a g  hairpins this  fold symmetric structure contains a quadruplex core consisting of a pair of symmetry related g syn  g syn  g anti  g anti tetrads where adjacent strands have both parallel and anti parallel neighbors and connecting t segments which form diagonal loops each of the g syn  g syn  g anti  g anti tetrads forms a platform on which stacks a t anti  a syn a anti  triad containing a novel a syn a anti platform step and a reversed hoogsteen a syn  t anti pair we observe both base base and base sugar stacking interactions with the latter occuring at a sheared a g step where the sugar of the a stacks on the purine plane of the g unexpectedly the topology of this sheared a anti g syn step has many similarities with the c anti g syn step in left handed z dna the t  a a triad is sandwiched between the g tetrad on one side and a reversed hoogsteen a anti  t anti pair on the other this intercalative topology is facilitated by a zipper like motif where the a anti residue of the triad is interdigitated within a stretched a anti g syn step our structural study reports on new aspects of a a platforms base triads zipper like interdigitation and sheared base steps together with base base and base sugar stacking defining a diamond like architecture for the d a g t a g  sequence one can anticipate that mixed guanine adenine sequences will exhibit a rich diversity of polymorphic architectures that will provide unique topologies for recognition by both nucleic acids and proteins
