local unfolding of cu zn superoxide dismutase monomer determines the morphology of fibrillar aggregates
aggregation of cu zn superoxide dismutase sod  is often found in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients the fibrillar aggregates formed by wild type and various disease associated mutants have recently been found to have distinct cores and morphologies previous computational and experimental studies of wild type sod suggest that the apo monomer highly aggregation prone displays substantial local unfolding dynamics the residual folded structure of locally unfolded aposod corresponds to peptide segments forming the aggregation core as identified by a combination of proteolysis and mass spectroscopy therefore we hypothesize that the destabilization of aposod caused by various mutations leads to distinct local unfolding dynamics the partially unfolded structure exposing the hydrophobic core and backbone hydrogen bond donors and acceptors is prone to aggregate the peptide segments in the residual folded structures form the  building block  for aggregation which in turn determines the morphology of the aggregates to test this hypothesis we apply a multiscale simulation approach to study the aggregation of three typical sod variants wild type g r and i  t each of these sod variants has distinct peptide segments forming the core structure and features different aggregate morphologies we perform atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to study the conformational dynamics of aposod monomer and coarse grained molecular dynamics simulations to study the aggregation of partially unfolded sod monomers our computational studies of monomer local unfolding and the aggregation of different sod variants are consistent with experiments supporting the hypothesis of the formation of aggregation  building blocks  via apo monomer local unfolding as the mechanism of sod fibrillar aggregation
