sus p facilitates pre initiation complex formation at the saga regulated genes independently of histone h b de ubiquitylation
sus p is a common component of transcriptional co activator saga spt ada gcn acetyltransferase  and mrna export complex trex  transcription export   and is involved in promoting transcription and mrna export however it is not clearly understood how sus p promotes transcription here we show that sus p is predominantly recruited to the upstream activating sequence of a saga dependent gene gal  under transcriptionally active conditions as a component of saga to promote the formation of pre initiation complex pic at the core promoter and consequently transcriptional initiation likewise sus p promotes the pic formation at other saga dependent genes and hence transcriptional initiation such function of sus p in promoting pic formation and transcriptional initiation is not mediated via its role in regulation of saga s histone h b de ubiquitylation activity however sus p s function in regulation of histone h b ubiquitylation is associated with transcriptional elongation dna repair and replication collectively our results support that sus p promotes pic formation and hence transcriptional initiation at the saga regulated genes independently of histone h b de ubiquitylation and further controls transcriptional elongation dna repair and replication via orchestration of histone h b ubiquitylation thus providing distinct functional insights of sus p in regulation of dna transacting processes
