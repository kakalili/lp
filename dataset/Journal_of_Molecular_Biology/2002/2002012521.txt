In the immune state bacteriophage P4 prevents expression of the replication functions by premature termination of transcription. A small RNA, the CI RNA, is the trans acting factor that regulates P4 immunity, by pairing to complementary target sequences and causing premature transcription termination. The CI RNA is matured by RNAse P and PNPase from the leader region of the same operon it regulates. In this work we better characterize this molecule. CI RNA copy number was determined to be around 500 molecules per lysogenic cell. By S1 mapping we defined the 3′-end at 8423(±1); thus CI RNA is 79(±1) nt long. The minimum region for correct processing requires two bases upstream of the CI RNA 5′-end and the CCA sequence at the 3′-end. Computer analysis by FOLD RNA of CI RNA sequence predicts a cloverleaf-like structure formed by a double-stranded stalk, a minor and a major stem loop, and a single-stranded bulge. We analysed several cI mutations, which fall either in the single or double-stranded CI RNA regions. Base substitutions in the main loop and in the single-stranded bulge apparently did not change CI RNA structure, but affected its activity by altering the complementarity with the target sequences, whereas a mutation in the secondary stem had a disruptive effect on CI RNA secondary structure. The effects of this latter mutation were suppressed by a base substitution that restored the complementarity with the corresponding base in the stem. Base substitutions in the main stem caused only local alterations in the secondary structure of CI. However, when the substitutions concerned either G8501 or its complementary base at the bottom of the stem, CI RNA was not correctly processed.
