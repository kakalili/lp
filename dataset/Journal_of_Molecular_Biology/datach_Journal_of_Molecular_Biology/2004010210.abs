crystal structure of echicetin from echis carinatus indian saw scaled viper at    resolution
echicetin is a heterodimeric protein from the venom of the indian saw scaled viper echis carinatus it binds to platelet glycoprotein ib gpib and thus inhibits platelet aggregation it has two subunits   and   consisting of   and   amino acid residues respectively the two chains are linked with a disulphide bond the level of amino acid sequence homology between two subunits is   the protein was purified from the venom of e carinatus and crystallized using ammonium sulphate as a precipitant the crystal structure has been determined at    resolution and refined to an r factor of    overall dimensions of the heterodimer are           the backbone folds of the two subunits are similar the central portions of the polypeptide chains of  and  subunits move into each other to form a tight dimeric association the remaining portions of the chains of both subunits fold in a manner similar to those observed in the carbohydrate binding domains of c type lectins in echicetin the ca  binding sites are not present despite being topologically equivalent to other similar ca  binding proteins of the superfamily the residues ser  glu  and glu  in the calcium binding proteins of the related family are conserved but the residues glu    are replaced by lysine at the corresponding sites in the  and  subunits
