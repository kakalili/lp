the crystal structure of the cytosolic exopolyphosphatase from saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals the basis for substrate specificity
inorganic long chain polyphosphate is a ubiquitous linear polymer in biology consisting of many phosphate moieties linked by phosphoanhydride bonds it is synthesized by polyphosphate kinase and metabolised by a number of enzymes including exo and endopolyphosphatases the saccharomyces cerevisiae gene ppx encodes for a   kda metal dependent cytosolic exopolyphosphatase that processively cleaves the terminal phosphate group from the polyphosphate chain until inorganic pyrophosphate is all that remains ppx belongs to the dhh family of phosphoesterases which includes family  inorganic pyrophosphatases found in gram positive bacteria prune a cyclic ampase and recj a single stranded dna exonuclease we describe the high resolution x ray structures of yeast ppx  solved using the multiple isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering miras technique and its complexes with phosphate      sulphate      and atp      yeast ppx folds into two domains and the structures reveal a strong similarity to the family  inorganic pyrophosphatases particularly in the active site region a large extended channel formed at the interface of the n and c terminal domains is lined with positively charged amino acids and represents a conduit for polyphosphate and the site of phosphate hydrolysis structural comparisons with the inorganic pyrophosphatases and analysis of the ligand bound complexes lead us to propose a hydrolysis mechanism finally we discuss a structural basis for substrate selectivity and processivity
