a new trick for an old dog tray binding to a homopurine homopyrimidine run attenuates dna replication edited by i tinoco
the effects of the d ga n d tc n repeat on plasmid replication in escherichia coli cells were analyzed using electrophoretic analysis of replication intermediates this repeat appeared to stall the replication fork progression in e coli strains carrying f  episomes the potency of replication stalling increased with the repeat  s length but did not depend on its orientation relative to the replication origin or transcription through the repeat treatment of e coli cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor chloramphenicol abolished replication blockage indicating that protein binding might be responsible for the repeat caused replication blockage concordantly dimethylsulfate footprinting in vivo revealed methylation protection of all guanine residues within the d ga n d tc n gel retardation assays with crude cell extracts confirmed the presence of a d ga n d tc n binding activity in f   but not f   strains further strains cured from the f  episome lost this activity while f  strains that acquired the f  factor via conjugation acquired d ga n d tc n binding activity as well thus this d ga n d tc n binding protein is encoded by the f  factor purification of this protein by affinity chromatography revealed a single polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of   kda microsequencing of its two tryptic peptides revealed two perfect matches with the tray protein which is encoded by the f factor overexpression of an individual tray protein in the f  e coli strain conveyed d ga n d tc n binding activity in vitro and replication stalling at d ga n d tc n repeats in vivo we conclude that tray binding to a homopurine homopyrimidine repeat is responsible for stalling dna replication biological applications of this phenomenon are discussed
