a new structural domain in the escherichia coli rcsc hybrid sensor kinase connects histidine kinase and phosphoreceiver domains
the rcs signalling pathway controls a variety of physiological functions like capsule synthesis cell division or motility in prokaryotes the rcs regulation cascade involving a multi step phosphorelay between the two membrane bound hybrid sensor kinases rcsc and rcsd and the global regulator rcsb is up to now one of the most complicated regulatory systems in bacteria to understand the structural basis of rcs signal transduction nmr spectroscopy was employed to determine the solution structure of the rcsc c terminus possessing a phosphoreceiver domain rcsc pr  and a region previously described as a long linker between the histidine kinase domain of rcsc rcsc hk and the rcsc pr we have found that the linker region comprises an independent structural domain of a new    organization which we named rcsc abl domain alpha beta loop  the abl domain appears to be a conserved and unique structural element of rcsc like kinases with no significant sequence homology to other proteins the second domain of the c terminus the rcsc pr domain represents a well folded chey like phosphoreceiver domain with the central parallel  sheet covered with two  helical layers on both sides we have mapped the interaction of rcsc abl and rcsc pr with the histidine phosphotransfer domain hpt of rcsd in addition we have characterized the interaction with and the conformational effects of mg  and the phosphorylation mimetic bef   on rcsc abl and rcsc pr
