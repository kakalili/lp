linkage between the intramembrane h bond network around aspartic acid  and the cytosolic environment of helix  in photoactivated rhodopsin
understanding the coupling between conformational changes in the intramembrane domain and at the membrane exposed surface of the bovine photoreceptor rhodopsin a prototypical g protein coupled receptor gpcr  is crucial for the elucidation of molecular mechanisms in gpcr activation here we have combined fourier transform infrared ftir and fluorescence spectroscopy to address the coupling between conformational changes in the intramembrane region around the retinal and the environment of helix  a putative cytosolic surface switch region in class i gpcrs using ftir fluorescence cross correlation we show specifically that surface alterations monitored by emission changes of fluorescein bound to cys  in helix  of rhodopsin are highly correlated with i h bonding to asp  proximal of the retinal schiff base but not to glu  close to the  ionone and ii with a metarhodopsin ii mii specific    cm   ir absorption change indicative of a partial loss of secondary structure in helix  upon mii formation these correlations are disrupted by limited c terminal proteolysis but are maintained upon binding of a transducin  subunit gt  derived peptide which stabilizes the mii state our results suggest that additional c terminal cytosolic loop contacts monitored by an amide ii absorption at    cm   play a functionally crucial role in keeping helix  in the position in which its environment is strongly coupled to the retinal binding site near the schiff base in the intramembrane region this coupling is mediated by the h bonding network that connects asp  to the npxxy x f motif preceding helix
