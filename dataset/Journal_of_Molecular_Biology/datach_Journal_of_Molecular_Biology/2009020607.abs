b crystallin a hybrid solid state solution state nmr investigation reveals structural aspects of the heterogeneous oligomer
atomic level structural information on  b crystallin  b  a prominent member of the small heat shock protein family has been a challenge to obtain due its polydisperse oligomeric nature we show that magic angle spinning solid state nmr can be used to obtain high resolution information on an    kda human  b assembled from   residue  kda subunits an    residue  crystallin domain is common to all small heat shock proteins and solution state nmr was performed on two different  crystallin domain constructs isolated from  b in vitro the chaperone like activities of full length  b and the isolated  crystallin domain are identical chemical shifts of the backbone and c  resonances have been obtained for residues       crystallin domain plus part of the c terminus in  b and the isolated  crystallin domain by solid state and solution state nmr respectively both sets of data strongly predict six  strands in the  crystallin domain a majority of residues in the  crystallin domain have similar chemical shifts in both solid state and solution state indicating similar structures for the domain in its isolated and oligomeric forms sites of intersubunit interaction are identified from chemical shift differences that cluster to specific regions of the  crystallin domain multiple signals are observed for the resonances of m  in the oligomer identifying the region containing this residue as existing in heterogeneous environments within  b evidence for a novel dimerization motif in the human  crystallin domain is obtained by a comparison of i solid state and solution state chemical shift data and ii  h   n heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra as a function of ph the isolated  crystallin domain undergoes a dimer  monomer transition over the ph range      this steep ph dependent switch may be important for  b to function optimally e g  to preserve the filament integrity of cardiac muscle proteins such as actin and desmin during cardiac ischemia which is accompanied by acidosis
