arsenate reduction thiol cascade chemistry with convergent evolution
the frequent abundance of arsenic in the environment has guided the evolution of enzymes for the reduction of arsenate the arsenate reductases arsc from different sources have unrelated sequences and structural folds and can be divided into different classes on the basis of their structures reduction mechanisms and the locations of catalytic cysteine residues the thioredoxin coupled arsenate reductase class is represented by staphylococcus aureus pi  arsc and bacillus subtilis arsc the arsc from escherichia coli plasmid r  and the eukaryotic acr p reductase from saccharomyces cerevisiae represent two distinct glutaredoxin linked arsc classes all are small cytoplasmic redox enzymes that reduce arsenate to arsenite by the sequential involvement of three different thiolate nucleophiles that function as a redox cascade in contrast the arrab complex is a bacterial heterodimeric periplasmic or a surface anchored arsenate reductase that functions as a terminal electron acceptor and transfers electrons from the membrane respiratory chain to arsenate finally the less well documented arsenate reductase activity of the monomeric arsenic iii methylase which is an s adenosylmethionine adomet dependent methyltransferase after each oxidative methylation cycle and before the next methylation step as v is reduced to as iii  methylation by this enzyme is also considered an arsenic resistance mechanism for bacteria fungi and mammals
