structures of yeast apa reveal catalytic insights into a canonical ap a phosphorylase of the histidine triad superfamily
the homeostasis of intracellular diadenosine       p p tetraphosphate ap a in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is maintained by two   sequence identical paralogs of ap a phosphorylases apa and apa  enzymatic assays show that compared to apa  apa has a relatively higher phosphorylase activity towards ap a        p p tetraphosphate  ap a and ap a        p p tetraphosphate  and ap a is the favorable substrate for both enzymes to decipher the catalytic insights we determined the crystal structures of apa in the apo  amp  and ap a complexed forms at       and    resolution respectively apa is an    protein with a core domain of a twisted eight stranded antiparallel  sheet flanked by several  helices similar to the galactose  phosphate uridylyltransferase galt members of the histidine triad hit superfamily however a unique auxiliary domain enables an individual apa monomer to possess an intact substrate binding cleft which is distinct from previously reported dimeric galt proteins this cleft is perfectly complementary to the favorable substrate ap a the amp and atp moieties of which are perpendicular to each other leaving the  phosphate group exposed at the sharp turn against the catalytic residue his   structural comparisons combined with site directed mutagenesis and activity assays enable us to define the key residues for catalysis furthermore multiple sequence alignment reveals that apa and homologs represent canonical ap a phosphorylases which could be grouped as a unique branch in the galt family
