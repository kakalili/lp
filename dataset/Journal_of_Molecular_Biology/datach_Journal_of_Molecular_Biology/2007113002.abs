a protein silencing switch by ligand induced proteasome targeting intrabodies
the selective knock down of cellular proteins has proven useful for in vivo studies of protein function and rnai methods are readily available for this purpose however interfering directly at the protein level may have distinct advantages with the intracellular targeting of antibodies intrabodies representing an attractive option although not a general one we demonstrate a novel general strategy named suicide or silencing intrabody technology sit  based on the inducible degradation of intrabodies which are equipped with proteasome targeting sequences and thus converted into suicide intrabodies we show that suicide intrabodies are able to redirect the target cellular proteins upon stimulus administration to the proteolytic machinery thus resulting in selective protein knock down remarkably suicide intrabody acts in a catalytic fashion sit is a ligand inducible strategy potentially applicable to any protein of interest and does not require the engineering of cellular proteolytic enzymes sit represents a general approach to confer  neutralizing  properties to any intrabody a valuable feature given the present impossibility to select a priori intrinsically neutralizing antibodies this knock down strategy together with available methods to isolate functional intrabodies should allow the large scale investigation of intracellular protein networks
