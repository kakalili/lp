formation of cytoplasmic turns between two closely spaced transmembrane helices during membrane protein integration into the er membrane edited by f cohen
the helical hairpin two closely spaced transmembrane helices separated by a short turn is a recurring structural element in integral membrane proteins and may serve as a compact unit that inserts into the membrane en bloc previously we have determined the propensities of the  natural amino acids when present in the middle of a long hydrophobic stretch to induce the formation of a helical hairpin with a lumenally exposed turn during membrane protein assembly into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane here we present results from a similar set of measurements but with the turn placed on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane we find that a significantly higher number of turn promoting residues need to be present to induce a cytoplasmic turn compared to a lumenal turn and that in contrast to the lumenal turn the positively charged residues arg and lys are the strongest turn promoters in cytoplasmic turns these results suggest that the process of turn formation between transmembrane helices is different for lumenal and cytoplasmic turns
