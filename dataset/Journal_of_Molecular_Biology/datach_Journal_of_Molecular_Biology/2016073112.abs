chopping and changing the evolution of the flavin dependent monooxygenases
flavin dependent monooxygenases play a variety of key physiological roles and are also very powerful biotechnological tools these enzymes have been classified into eight different classes a  h based on their sequences and biochemical features by combining structural and sequence analysis and phylogenetic inference we have explored the evolutionary history of classes a b e f and g and demonstrate that their multidomain architectures reflect their phylogenetic relationships suggesting that the main evolutionary steps in their divergence are likely to have arisen from the recruitment of different domains additionally the functional divergence within in each class appears to have been the result of other mechanisms such as a complex set of single point mutations our results reinforce the idea that a main constraint on the evolution of cofactor dependent enzymes is the functional binding of the cofactor additionally a remarkable feature of this family is that the sequence of the key flavin adenine dinucleotide binding domain is split into at least two parts in all classes studied here we propose a complex set of evolutionary events that gave rise to the origin of the different classes within this family
