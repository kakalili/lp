farnesylation of the snare protein ykt increases its stability and helical folding
the evolutionarily conserved soluble n ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptor snare proteins are involved in the fusion of vesicles with their target membranes while most snares are permanently anchored to membranes by their transmembrane domains the vesicle associated snare ykt has been found both in soluble and in membrane bound pools the r snare ykt is thought to mediate interactions between various q snares by a reversible membrane targeting cycle membrane attachment of ykt is achieved by its c terminal prenylation and palmitoylation motif succeeding the snare motif in this study we have analyzed full length farnesylated ykt from yeast and humans by biochemical and structural means in vitro farnesylation of the c terminal caax box of recombinant full length ykt resulted in stabilization of the native protein and a more compactly folded structure as shown by size exclusion chromatography and limited proteolysis circular dichroism spectroscopy indicated a specific increase in the helical content of the farnesylated ykt compared to the nonlipidated form or the single longin domain which correlated with a marked increase in stability as observed by heat denaturation experiments although highly soluble farnesylated ykt is capable of lipid membrane binding independent of the membrane charge as shown by surface plasmon resonance the crystal structure of the n terminal longin domain of yeast ykt      was determined at     resolution as similarly found in a previous nmr structure the ykt longin domain contains a hydrophobic patch at its surface that may accommodate the lipid moiety in the crystal structure this hydrophobic surface is buried in a crystallographic homomeric dimer interface together these observations support a previously suggested closed conformation of cytosolic ykt  where the c terminal farnesyl moiety folds onto a hydrophobic groove in the n terminal longin domain
