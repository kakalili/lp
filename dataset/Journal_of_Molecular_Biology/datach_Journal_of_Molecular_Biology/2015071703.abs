negative epistasis and evolvability in tem   lactamase  the thin line between an enzyme s conformational freedom and disorder
epistasis is a key factor in evolution since it determines which combinations of mutations provide adaptive solutions and which mutational pathways toward these solutions are accessible by natural selection there is growing evidence for the pervasiveness of sign epistasis  a complete reversion of mutational effects particularly in protein evolution  yet its molecular basis remains poorly understood we describe the structural basis of sign epistasis between g  s and r  s two adaptive mutations in tem   lactamase  an enzyme that endows antibiotics resistance separated by    these mutations initiate two separate trajectories toward increased hydrolysis rates and resistance toward second and third generation cephalosporins antibiotics both mutations allow the enzyme s active site to adopt alternative conformations and accommodate the new antibiotics by solving the corresponding set of crystal structures we found that r  s causes local disorder whereas g  s induces discrete conformations when combined the mutations in   and   induce local disorder whereby nonproductive conformations that perturb the enzyme s catalytic preorganization dominate specifically asn  that coordinates the deacylating water molecule is misaligned in both the free form and the inhibitor bound double mutant this local disorder is not restored by stabilizing global suppressor mutations and thus leads to an evolutionary cul de sac conformational dynamism therefore underlines the reshaping potential of protein s structures and functions but also limits protein evolvability because of the fragility of the interactions networks that maintain protein structures
