role of the charge  charge interactions in defining stability and halophilicity of the cspb proteins
charge  charge interactions on the surface of native proteins are important for protein stability and can be computationally redesigned in a rational way to modulate protein stability such computational effort led to an engineered protein cspb tb that has the same core as the mesophilic cold shock protein cspb bs from bacillus subtilis but optimized distribution of charge  charge interactions on the surface the cspb tb protein shows an increase in the transition temperature by    c relative to the unfolding temperature of cspb bs the cspb tb and cspb bs protein pair offers a unique opportunity to further explore the energetics of charge  charge interactions as the substitutions at the same sequence positions are done in largely similar structural but different electrostatic environments in particular we addressed two questions what is the contribution of charge  charge interactions in the unfolded state to the protein stability and how amino acid substitutions modulate the effect of increase in ionic strength on protein stability i e protein halophilicity  to this end we experimentally measured the stabilities of over   variants of cspb tb and cspb bs proteins with substitutions at charged residues we also performed computational modeling of these protein variants analysis of the experimental and computational data allowed us to conclude that the charge  charge interactions in the unfolded state of two model proteins cspb bs and cspb tb are not very significant and computational models that are based only on the native state structure can adequately i e qualitatively stabilizing versus destabilizing and semi quantitatively relative rank order  predict the effects of surface charge neutralization or reversal on protein stability we also show that the effect of ionic strength on protein stability protein halophilicity appears to be mainly due to the screening of the long range charge  charge interactions
