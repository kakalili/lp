inter helical hydrogen bonds are essential elements for intra protein signal transduction the role of asp  in bacteriorhodopsin transport function
the behavior of the d  a mutant was analyzed by time resolved uv vis and fourier transformed infrared ftir spectroscopies aiming to clarify the role of asp  in the intra protein signal transductions occurring during the bacteriorhodopsin photocycle uv vis data on the d  a mutant show severely desynchronized photocycle kinetics ftir data show a poor transmission of the retinal isomerization to the chromoprotein evidenced by strongly attenuated helical changes amide i  the remarkable absence of environment alterations and protonation deprotonation events related to asp  and direct schiff base sb protonation form the bulk this argues for the interactions of asp  with leu  via water molecule and thr  as key elements for the effective and vectorial proton path between asp  and the sb in the cytoplasmic half of bacteriorhodopsin the results strongly suggest the presence of a regulation motif enclosed in helices c and d thr   pro  asp   which drives properly the dynamics of helix c through a set of interactions it also supports the idea that intra helical hydrogen bonding clusters in the buried regions of transmembrane proteins can be potential elements in intra protein signal transduction
