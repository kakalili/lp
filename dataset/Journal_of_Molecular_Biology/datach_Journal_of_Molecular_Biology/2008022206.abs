the archaeal xpb protein is a ssdna dependent atpase with a novel partner
xpb is a superfamily  helicase with a       polarity in eukaryotes xpb is an integral subunit of the transcription factor tfiih which plays a dual role in dna opening at rna polymerase ii promoters and in establishing the repair bubble around a dna lesion in nucleotide excision repair eukaryotic xpb has only very limited helicase activity in vitro and may function as a dna dependent molecular switch to catalyse local distortion of dna in transcription and repair most archaea have one or two homologues of the xpb protein with a presumed role in dna repair but only one other subunit of the tfiih complex the       helicase xpd has been identified in archaea here we report the biochemical characterisation of the two homologous xpb proteins from the crenarchaeon sulfolobus solfataricus although both proteins are single stranded dna stimulated atpases neither displays any helicase activity in vitro consistent with recent studies of eukaryotic xpb in almost all archaeal genomes the xpb gene lies adjacent to a conserved partner gene and we demonstrate that these two gene products form a physical interaction in vitro we propose the name bax  binds archaeal xpb for this protein which has a predicted endonuclease domain xpb and bax may collaborate in processing nucleic acid in an archaeal specific dna repair pathway
