the three dimensional structure of nifese hydrogenase from desulfovibrio vulgaris hildenborough a hydrogenase without a bridging ligand in the active site in its oxidised   as isolated  state
hydrogen is a good energy vector and its production from renewable sources is a requirement for its widespread use  nifese hydrogenases hases are attractive candidates for the biological production of hydrogen because they are capable of high production rates even in the presence of moderate amounts of o  lessening the requirements for anaerobic conditions the three dimensional structure of the nifese hase from desulfovibrio vulgaris hildenborough has been determined in its oxidised  as isolated  form at     resolution remarkably this is the first structure of an oxidised hase of the nife family that does not contain an oxide bridging ligand at the active site instead an extra sulfur atom is observed binding ni and se leading to a secys conformation that shields the nife site from contact with oxygen this structure provides several insights that may explain the fast activation and o tolerance of these enzymes
