crystal structure of sumo modified proliferating cell nuclear antigen
eukaryotic proliferating cell nuclear antigen pcna is a replication accessory protein that functions in dna replication repair and recombination the various functions of pcna are regulated by posttranslational modifications including mono ubiquitylation which promotes translesion synthesis and sumoylation which inhibits recombination to understand how sumo modification regulates pcna we generated a split sumo modified pcna protein and showed that it supports cell viability and stimulates dna polymerase  activity we then determined its x ray crystal structure and found that sumo occupies a position on the back face of the pcna ring which is distinct from the position occupied by ubiquitin in the structure of ubiquitin modified pcna we propose that the back of pcna has evolved to be a site of regulation that can be easily modified without disrupting ongoing reactions on the front of pcna such as normal dna replication moreover these modifications likely allow pcna to function as a tool belt whereby proteins can be recruited to the replication machinery via the back of pcna and be held in reserve until needed
