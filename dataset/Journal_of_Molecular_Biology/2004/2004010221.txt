Members of the Bcl-2 protein family regulate apoptosis by controlling the release of apoptogenic proteins such as cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Proapoptotic members induce release by increasing outer membrane permeability, while antiapoptotic members prevent this. The activity of Bcl-2 proteins depends mostly on their insertion into the mitochondrial membrane, which is reported to occur via putative channels formed by the two central hydrophobic helices. The pro- and antiapoptotic activity of Bcl-2 proteins can also be modulated by heterodimerization between antagonists through the BH3 domain of proapoptotic members, though the position of the heterodimer with respect to the membrane has never been elucidated. In this work, the membrane insertion capacity of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 related protein Nr-13 was explored, using monolayer expansion measurements. Nr-13 penetrates into the monolayer with a molecular cross-section of 1100Å2, thereby implicating almost all α-helical domains of the molecule in this process. A mutant protein, bearing neutral instead of acidic residues in the loop between the two putative channel-forming fifth and sixth α-helices, retained the ability to interact with the lipid monolayer, suggesting that the membrane insertion of Nr-13 is not exclusively α5-α6-dependent. In contrast, the specific interaction of Nr-13 with the monolayer was prevented by heterodimer formation with the BH3 domain of proapoptotic Bax. These findings are discussed in terms of a model for monolayer insertion in which the antiapoptotic Nr-13 and proapoptotic proteins exert their antagonistic effects by preventing each other from reaching the membrane.
