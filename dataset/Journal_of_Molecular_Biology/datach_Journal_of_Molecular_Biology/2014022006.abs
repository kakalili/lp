gpib  interacts exclusively with exosite ii of thrombin
activation of platelets by the serine protease thrombin is a critical event in haemostasis this process involves the binding of thrombin to glycoprotein ib  gpib  and cleavage of protease activated receptors pars  the n terminal extracellular domain of gpib  contains an acidic peptide stretch that has been identified as the main thrombin binding site and both anion binding exosites of thrombin have been implicated in gpib  binding but it remains unclear how they are involved this issue is of critical importance for the mechanism of platelet activation by thrombin if both exosites bind to gpib  thrombin could potentially act as a platelet adhesion molecule or receptor dimerisation trigger alternatively if only a single site is involved gpib  may serve as a cofactor for par  activation by thrombin to determine the involvement of thrombin s two exosites in gpib  binding we employed the complementary methods of mutational analysis binding studies x ray crystallography and nmr spectroscopy our results indicate that the peptide corresponding to the c terminal portion of gpib  and the entire extracellular domain bind exclusively to thrombin s exosite ii the interaction of thrombin with gpib  thus serves to recruit thrombin activity to the platelet surface while leaving exosite i free for par  recognition
