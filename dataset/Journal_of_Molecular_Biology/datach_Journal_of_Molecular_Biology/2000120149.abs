the    resolution structure of the o h blood group specific lectin i from ulex europaeus    this manuscript is dedicated to the memory of professor raymond u lemieux        edited by i wilson
the tertiary and quaternary structure of the lectin i from ulex europaeus ue i has been determined to    resolution ue i is a dimeric metalloglycoprotein that binds the h type  human blood group determinant   l fuc        d gal        d glcnac   nine changes from the published amino acid sequence were necessary to account for the electron density the quaternary structural organization of ue i is that of the most commonly occurring legume lectin dimer the tertiary structure of the monomeric subunits is similar to that in the conventional lectin subunit however some structural differences are noted these differences include a four stranded anti parallel  s  sheet in ue i versus the five stranded s sheet in other lectin monomers the ala residue of the ala asp cis peptide bond present in the carbohydrate binding site of the conventional lectin monomer is replaced with a thr in the ue i structure also a novel disulfide bridge linking cys  and cys  is present there are two metallic ions one calcium and the other manganese per subunit n linked oligosaccharides are at residues  and   of each subunit one molecule of r  methyl   pentanediol r mpd is present in a shallow depression on the surface of each subunit in order to examine the binding of the h type  blood group determinant by ue i its  methyl glycoside h type  ome was docked into the binding site of r mpd the epitope previously identified for h type  ome by chemical mapping proved with only minor adjustment of amino acid residues to be complementary to the shallow cavity occupied by r mpd in the structure several key interactions have been proposed between the h type  ome and ue i
