a conserved cysteine within the atpase domain of the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone bip is necessary for a complete complement of bip activities
among the amino acids cysteine stands apart based on its highly reactive sulfur group in general cysteine is underrepresented in proteins yet when present the features of cysteine often afford unique function we have shown previously that a cysteine within the atpase domain of yeast bip kar  serves as a sensor of the endoplasmic reticulum er redox environment     under conditions of increased oxidant oxidative stress  this cysteine becomes oxidized changing kar from an atp dependent foldase to an atp independent holdase we were struck by the high degree of conservation for this cysteine between bip orthologs and we sought to determine how cysteine substitution impacts kar function we observed that no single amino acid replacement is capable of recreating the range of functions that can be achieved by wild type kar with its cysteine in either unmodified or oxidized states however we were able to generate mutants that could selectively replicate the distinct activities exhibited by either unmodified or oxidized kar  we found that the atpase activity displayed by unmodified kar is fully maintained when cys  is replaced with ala or val conversely we demonstrate that several amino acid substitutions including his phe pro trp and tyr support an enhanced viability during oxidative stress associated with oxidized kar  although these alleles are compromised as an atpase we reveal that the range of activity demonstrated by wild type kar can be replicated by co expression of kar mutants that mimic either the unmodified or oxidized kar state allowing for growth during standard and oxidative stress conditions
