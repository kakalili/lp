oligomerization propensity and flexibility of yeast frataxin studied by x ray crystallography and small angle x ray scattering
frataxin is a mitochondrial protein with a central role in iron homeostasis defects in frataxin function lead to friedreich s ataxia a progressive neurodegenerative disease with childhood onset the function of frataxin has been shown to be closely associated with its ability to form oligomeric species however the factors controlling oligomerization and the types of oligomers present in solution are a matter of debate using small angle x ray scattering we found that co  glycerol and a single amino acid substitution at the n terminus y a facilitate oligomerization of yeast frataxin resulting in a dynamic equilibrium between monomers dimers trimers hexamers and higher order oligomers using x ray crystallography we found that co  binds inside the channel at the  fold axis of the trimer which suggests that the metal has an oligomer stabilizing role the results reveal the types of oligomers present in solution and support our earlier suggestions that the trimer is the main building block of yeast frataxin oligomers they also indicate that different mechanisms may control oligomer stability and oligomerization in vivo
