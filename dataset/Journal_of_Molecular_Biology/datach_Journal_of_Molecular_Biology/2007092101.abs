crystal structure of the escherichia coli regulator of    rsd in complex with   domain
the escherichia coli rsd protein binds tightly and specifically to the rna polymerase rnap    factor rsd plays a role in alternative  factor dependent transcription by biasing the competition between   and alternative  factors for the available core rnap here we determined the     resolution x ray crystal structure of rsd bound to   domain      the primary determinant for rsd binding within    the structure reveals that rsd binding interferes with the two primary functions of    core rnap binding and promoter    element binding interestingly the most highly conserved rsd residues form a network of interactions through the middle of the rsd structure that connect the    binding surface with three cavities exposed on distant surfaces of rsd suggesting functional coupling between    binding and other binding surfaces of rsd either for other proteins or for as yet unknown small molecule effectors these results provide a structural basis for understanding the role of rsd as well as its ortholog algq a positive regulator of pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence in transcription regulation
