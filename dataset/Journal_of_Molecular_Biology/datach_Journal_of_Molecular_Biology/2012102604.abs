construction of a stability landscape of the ch domain of human igg by combining directed evolution with high throughput sequencing
one of the most important but still poorly understood issues in protein chemistry is the relationship between sequence and stability of proteins here we present a method for analyzing the influence of each individual residue on the foldability and stability of an entire protein a randomly mutated library of the crystallizable fragment of human immunoglobulin g class  igg fc was expressed on the surface of yeast followed by heat incubation at   c and selection of stable variants that still bound to structurally specific ligands high throughput sequencing allowed comparison of the mutation rate between the starting and selected library pools enabling the generation of a stability landscape for the entire ch domain of human igg at single residue resolution its quality was analyzed with respect to i the structure of igg fc  ii evolutionarily conserved positions and iii in silico calculations of the energy of unfolding of all variants in comparison with the wild type protein in addition this new experimental approach allowed the assignment of functional epitopes of structurally specific ligands used for selection fc   receptor i cd  and anti human ch domain antibody to distinct binding regions in the ch domain
