insight into dna and protein transport in double stranded dna viruses the structure of bacteriophage n
bacteriophage n encapsidates a   aa long dna dependent rna polymerase vrnap  which is injected into the host along with the n genome upon infection the three dimensional structures of wild type and mutant n viruses lacking gp  gp  or gp  were determined by cryoelectron microscopy the virion has an icosahedral capsid with t  quasi symmetry that encapsidates well organized double stranded dna and vrnap the tail attached at a unique pentameric vertex of the head consists of a neck   appendages and six ribbons that constitute a non contractile sheath around a central tail tube comparison of wild type and mutant virus structures in conjunction with bioinformatics established the identity and virion locations of the major capsid protein gp   a decorating protein gp   the vrnap gp   the tail sheath gp   the appendages gp   and the portal protein gp   the n virion organization provides insight into its assembly and suggests a mechanism for genome and vrnap transport strategies utilized by this unique system
