mechanism of hydrolysis of phosphate esters by the dimetal center of   nucleotidase based on crystal structures edited by r huber
nucleotidase belongs to a large superfamily of distantly related dinuclear metallophosphatases including the ser thr protein phosphatases and purple acid phosphatases the protein undergoes a   domain rotation between an open inactive and a closed active enzyme form complex structures of the closed form with the products adenosine and phosphate and with the substrate analogue inhibitor    methylene adp have been determined at    and     resolution respectively in addition a complex of the open form of   nucleotidase with atp was analyzed at a resolution of     these structures show that the adenosine group binds to a specific binding pocket of the c terminal domain the adenine ring is stacked between phe  and phe   the n terminal domain provides the ligands to the dimetal cluster and the conserved his   which together form the catalytic core structure however the three c terminal arginine residues     and   which are involved in substrate binding may also play a role in transition state stabilization the  phosphate group of the inhibitor is terminally coordinated to the site  metal ion the site  metal ion coordinates a water molecule which is in an ideal position for a nucleophilic attack on the phosphorus atom assuming an in line mechanism of phosphoryl transfer another water molecule bridges the two metal ions
