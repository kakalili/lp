structural determinants of pld inhibition by  synuclein
the presynaptic protein  synuclein has been implicated in both neuronal plasticity and neurodegenerative disease but its normal function remains unclear we described the induction of an amphipathic  helix at the n terminus exons    of  synuclein upon exposure to phospholipid vesicles and hypothesized that lipid binding might serve as a functional switch by stabilizing  synuclein in an active   helical conformation others have shown that  and  synucleins inhibit phospholipase d pld  an enzyme involved in lipid mediated signaling cascades and vesicle trafficking here we report that all three naturally occurring synuclein isoforms     and  synuclein are similarly effective inhibitors of pld in vitro as is the parkinson s disease associated mutant a p the pd associated mutant a t however is a more potent inhibitor of pld than is wild type  synuclein we analyze mutations of the  synuclein protein to identify critical determinants of human pld inhibition in vitro deletion of residues      exon  decreases pld inhibition significantly this activity of exon  may require adoption of an  helical conformation as mutations that disrupt  helicity also abrogate inhibition deletion of c terminal residues      exon  completely abolishes inhibitory activity in addition pld inhibition is blocked by phosphorylation at serine   or at tyrosine residues   and   or by mutations that mimic phosphorylation at these sites we conclude that pld inhibition by  synuclein is mediated by a lipid stabilized  helical structure in exon  and also by residues within exon  and that this inhibition can be modulated by phosphorylation of specific residues in exons  and
