function of the c terminal domain of the dead box protein mss  p analyzed in vivo and in vitro
the dead box proteins cyt  in neurospora crassa and mss  p in saccharomyces cerevisiae are general rna chaperones that function in splicing mitochondrial group i and group ii introns and in translational activation both proteins consist of a conserved atp dependent rna helicase core region linked to n and c terminal domains the latter with a basic tail similar to many other dead box proteins in cyt   this basic tail was shown to contribute to non specific rna binding that helps tether the core helicase region to structured rna substrates here multiple sequence alignments and secondary structure predictions indicate that cyt  and mss  p belong to distinct subgroups of dead box proteins whose c terminal domains have a defining extended  helical region preceding the basic tail we find that mutations or c terminal truncations in the predicted  helical region of mss  p strongly inhibit rna dependent atpase activity leading to loss of function in both translational activation and rna splicing these findings suggest that the  helical region may stabilize and or regulate the activity of the rna helicase core by contrast a truncation that removes only the basic tail leaves high rna dependent atpase activity and causes only a modest reduction in translation and rna splicing efficiency in vivo and in vitro biochemical analysis shows that deletion of the basic tail leads to weaker non specific binding of group i and group ii intron rnas and surprisingly also impairs rna unwinding at saturating protein concentrations and nucleotide dependent tight binding of single stranded rnas by the rna helicase core together our results indicate that the two sub regions of mss  p s c terminal domain act in different ways to support and modulate activities of the core helicase region whose rna unwinding activity is critical for both the translation and rna splicing functions
