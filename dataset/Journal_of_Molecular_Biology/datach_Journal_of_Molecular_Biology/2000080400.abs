characterisation of the newly identified human ump homologue pomp and analysis of lmp   i incorporation into  s proteasomes edited by r huber
biogenesis of mammalian  s proteasomes occurs via precursor complexes containing  and unprocessed  subunits a human homologue of the yeast proteasome maturation factor ump was identified in d gels of  s precursor preparations and designated as pomp proteasome maturation protein  we show that pomp is detected only in precursor fractions and not in fractions containing mature  s proteasome northern blot experiments revealed that expression of pomp is induced after treatment with interferon   to analyse the role of the   propeptide for proper maturation and incorporation of the   subunit into the complex human t cells which highly express derivatives of the  i subunit lmp  were studied in contrast to yeast the presence of the   propeptide is not essential for incorporation of lmp into the proteasome complex mutated lmp subunits either carrying the prosequence of  i lmp  or containing a mutation in the active threonine site are incorporated like wild type lmp  while a lmp derivative lacking the prosequence completely is incorporated to a lesser extent although the absence of the prosequence does not affect incorporation of lmp  its deletion leads to delayed proteasome maturation and thereby to an accumulation of precursor complexes as a result of the precursor accumulation an increased amount of the pomp protein can be detected in these cells
