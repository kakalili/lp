Bacteriophage P4 immunity is controlled by a small stable RNA (CI RNA) that derives from the processing of primary transcripts. In previous works, we observed that the endonuclease RNase P is required for the maturation of CI RNA 5′-end; moreover, we found that polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), a 3′ to 5′ RNA-degrading enzyme, is required for efficient 5′-end processing of CI RNA, suggesting that 3′-end degradation of the primary transcript might be involved in the production of proper RNase P substrates. Here, we demonstrate that another Escherichia coli nuclease, RNase E, would appear to be involved in this process. We found that transcripts of the P4 immunity region are modified by the post-transcriptional addition of short poly(A) tails and heteropolymeric tails with prevalence of A residues. Most oligoadenylated transcripts encompass the whole cI locus and are thus compatible as intermediates in the CI RNA maturation pathway. On the contrary, in a polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase)-defective host, adenylation occurred most frequently within cI, implying that such transcripts are targeted for degradation. We did not find polyadenylation in a pcnB mutant, suggesting that the pcnB-encoded polyadenyl polymerase I (PAP I) is the only enzyme responsible for modification of P4 immunity transcripts. Maturation of CI RNA 5′-end in such a mutant was impaired, further supporting the idea that processing of the 3′-end of primary transcripts is an important step for efficient maturation of CI RNA by RNase P.
