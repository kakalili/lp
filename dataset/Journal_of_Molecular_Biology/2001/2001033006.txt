Mitochondria of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contain three different Hsp70 chaperones, Ssc1, Ecm10 and Ssq1. Ssc1 is an essential protein that mediates the import of nuclear-encoded proteins into the organelle and their subsequent folding. The nucleotide state of Ssc1 is thereby regulated by the nucleotide exchange factor Mge1. Here, we show that Mge1 interacts with Ssq1 in an ATP-dependent manner, suggesting that Mge1 also regulates Ssq1 function. In contrast to Ssc1, Ssq1 does not associate with the Tim44 subunit of the protein translocating complex, indicating a different function of both chaperones. Mutants in Ssq1 were reported to have low levels of iron sulfur (FeS) cluster-containing enzymes. Employing an assay that allowed us to monitor the conversion of the apoform of mitochondrial ferredoxin into its FeS-containing holoform, Ssq1 was demonstrated to be required for the FeS cluster assembly in mitochondria. The mitochondrial DnaJ homolog Jac1 is crucial for this process, whereas Mdj1 function is dispensable. Furthermore, the presence of frataxin is necessary for FeS cluster assembly into ferredoxin suggesting a role for frataxin at the level of the formation of holo-ferredoxin.
