regions within the n terminal domain of human topoisomerase i exert important functions during strand rotation and dna binding
the human topoisomerase i n terminal domain is the only part of the enzyme still not crystallized and the function of this domain remains enigmatical in the present study we have addressed the specific functions of individual n terminal regions of topoisomerase i by characterizing mutants lacking amino acid residues     or      or having tryptophane   substituted by glycine in a broad variety of in vitro activity assays as a result of these investigations we find that mutants altered in the region      distinguished themselves from the wild type enzyme by a faster strand rotation step insensitivity towards the anti cancer drug camptothecin in relaxation and the inability to ligate blunt end dna fragments the mutant lacking amino acid residues     was impaired in blunt end dna ligation and showed wild type sensitivity towards camptothecin in relaxation taken together the presented data support a model according to which tryptophane   and possibly other residues located between position      coordinates the restriction of free strand rotation during the topoisomerization step of catalysis moreover tryptophane   appears important for the function of the bulk part of the n terminal domain in direct dna interaction
