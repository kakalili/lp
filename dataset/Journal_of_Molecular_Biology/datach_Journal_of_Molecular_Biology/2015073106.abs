structural and functional analysis of the signal transducing linker in the ph responsive one component system cadc of escherichia coli
the ph responsive one component signaling system cadc in escherichia coli belongs to the family of toxr like proteins whose members share a conserved modular structure with an n terminal cytoplasmic winged helix  turn  helix dna binding domain being followed by a single transmembrane helix and a c terminal periplasmic ph sensing domain in e coli cadc a cytoplasmic linker comprising approximately  amino acids is essential for transmission of the signal from the sensor to the dna binding domain however the mechanism of transduction is poorly understood using nmr spectroscopy we demonstrate here that the linker region is intrinsically disordered in solution furthermore mutational analyses showed that it tolerates a range of amino acid substitutions altering polarity rigidity and  helix forming propensity  is robust to extension but is sensitive to truncation indeed truncations either reversed the expression profile of the target operon cadba or decoupled expression from external ph altogether cadc dimerizes via its periplasmic domain but light scattering analysis provided no evidence for dimerization of the isolated dna binding domain with or without the linker region however bacterial two hybrid analysis revealed that cadc forms stable dimers in a stimulus and linker dependent manner interacting only at ph lt   strikingly a variant with inversed cadba expression profile which lacks most of the linker dimerizes preferentially at higher ph thus we propose that the disordered cadc linker is required for transducing the ph dependent response of the periplasmic sensor into a structural rearrangement that facilitates dimerization of the cytoplasmic cadc dna binding domain
