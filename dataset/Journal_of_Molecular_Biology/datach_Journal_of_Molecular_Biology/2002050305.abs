the mechanism and pathway of ph induced swelling in cowpea chlorotic mottle virus
normal mode analysis based on a simplified energy function was used to study the swelling process of the icosahedral virus cowpea chlorotic mottle virus ccmv  native state virus particles coat proteins of this t  icosahedral virus have been shown to undergo a large conformational change to a swollen state when metal ions are removed or the ph is raised a normal mode analysis based on the native state capsid showed one preferential direction a breathing mode that explains the majority of the structural rearrangement necessary to bring the native structure close to the swollen state from the native form of ccmv the structure can be displaced along the direction of a single breathing mode by different amounts to create several candidate swollen structures and a putative pathway for virus expansion the r factor between these predicted swollen capsid structures and experimental electron density from cryoelectron microscopy cryo em measurements is then calculated to indicate how well each structure satisfies the experimental measurements on the swollen capsid state a decrease of the crystallographic r factor value from    to    was observed for these simple incremental displacements along the breathing mode the simultaneous displacement of the native structure along other relevant symmetric non degenerate modes produce a structure with an r factor of   which is further reduced to    after minimization a value in good accord with models based on the em data at   resolution based on the incrementally expanded structures a pathway for the swelling process has been proposed analysis of the intermediate structures along this pathway indicates a significant loss of interactions at the quasi  fold interfaces occurs in the initial stages of the swelling process and this serves as a trigger for the compact to swollen transition furthermore the ph dependent swelling appears to be triggered by the titration of a single residue with an anomalous pka value in the unswollen particle
