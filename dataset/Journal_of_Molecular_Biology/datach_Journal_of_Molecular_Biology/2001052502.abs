covalent joining of the subunits of a homodimeric type ii restriction endonuclease single chain pvuii endonuclease edited by j karn
the pvuii restriction endonuclease has been converted from its natural homodimeric form into a single polypeptide chain by tandemly linking the two subunits through a short peptide linker the arrangement of the single chain pvuii sc pvuii is     glyserglygly     where     represents the amino acid residues of the enzyme subunit and glyserglygly is the peptide linker by introducing the corresponding tandem gene into escherichia coli pvuii endonuclease activity could be detected in functional in vivo assays the sc enzyme was expressed at high level as a soluble protein the purified enzyme was shown to have the molecular mass expected for the designed sc protein based on the dna cleavage patterns obtained with different substrates the cleavage specificity of the sc pvuii is indistinguishable from that of the wild type wt enzyme the sc enzyme binds specifically to the cognate dna site under non catalytic conditions in the presence of ca  with the expected   stoichiometry under standard catalytic conditions the sc enzyme cleaves simultaneously the two dna strands in a concerted manner steady state kinetic parameters of dna cleavage by the sc and wt pvuii showed that the sc enzyme is a potent but somewhat less efficient catalyst the kcat km values are       and       min   m   for the sc and wt enzyme respectively the activity decrease is due to the lower turnover number and to the lower substrate affinity the sc arrangement provides a facile route to obtain asymmetrically modified heterodimeric enzymes
