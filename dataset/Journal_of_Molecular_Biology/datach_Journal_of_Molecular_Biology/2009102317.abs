structural and kinetic studies of the allosteric transition in sulfolobus solfataricus uracil phosphoribosyltransferase permanent activation by engineering of the c terminus
uracil phosphoribosyltransferase catalyzes the conversion of  phosphoribosyl   diphosphate prpp and uracil to uridine monophosphate ump and diphosphate ppi  the tetrameric enzyme from sulfolobus solfataricus has a unique type of allosteric regulation by cytidine triphosphate ctp and guanosine triphosphate gtp  here we report two structures of the activated state in complex with gtp one structure refined at    resolution contains prpp in all active sites while the other structure refined at    resolution has prpp in two sites and the hydrolysis products ribose  phosphate and ppi in the other sites combined with three existing structures of uracil phosphoribosyltransferase in complex with ump and the allosteric inhibitor cytidine triphosphate ctp  these structures provide valuable insight into the mechanism of allosteric transition from inhibited to active enzyme the regulatory triphosphates bind at a site in the center of the tetramer in a different manner and change the quaternary arrangement both effectors contact pro  at the beginning of a long  strand in the dimer interface which extends into a flexible loop over the active site in the gtp bound state two flexible loop residues tyr  and lys   bind the ppi moiety of prpp in the neighboring subunit and contribute to catalysis while in the inhibited state they contribute to the configuration of the active site for ump rather than prpp binding the c terminal gly  participates in a hydrogen bond network in the dimer interface that stabilizes the inhibited but not the activated state tagging the c terminus with additional amino acids generates an endogenously activated enzyme that binds gtp without effects on activity
