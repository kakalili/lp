a novel haem binding interface in the   kda haem binding protein p hbp
the   kda haem binding protein p hbp is highly expressed in erythropoietic tissues and binds to a range of metallo and non metalloporphyrin molecules with similar affinities suggesting a role in haem regulation or synthesis we have determined the three dimensional solution structure of p hbp and mapped the porphyrin binding site which comprises a number of loops and a  helix all located on a single face of the molecule the structure of p hbp is related to the bacterial multi drug resistance protein bmrr and is the first protein with this fold to be identified in eukaryotes strikingly the porphyrin binding site in p hbp is located in a similar position to the drug binding site of bmrr these similarities suggest that the broad ligand specificity observed for both bmrr and p hbp may result from a conserved ligand interaction mechanism taken together these data suggest that the both the fold and its associated function that of binding to a broad range of small hydrophobic molecules are ancient and have been adapted throughout evolution for a variety of purposes
