crystal structure of aspartate racemase from pyrococcus horikoshii ot and its implications for molecular mechanism of plp independent racemization
there exists a d enantiomer of aspartic acid in lactic acid bacteria and several hyperthermophilic archaea which is biosynthesized from the l enantiomer by aspartate racemase aspartate racemase is a representative pyridoxal   phosphate plp independent amino acid racemase the  two base  catalytic mechanism has been proposed for this type of racemase in which a pair of cysteine residues are utilized as the conjugated catalytic acid and base we have determined the three dimensional structure of aspartate racemase from the hyperthermophilic archaeum pyrococcus horikoshii ot at    resolution by x ray crystallography and refined it to a crystallographic r factor of    rfree of     this is the first structure reported for aspartate racemase indeed for any amino acid racemase from archaea the crystal structure revealed that this enzyme forms a stable dimeric structure with a strong three layered inter subunit interaction and that its subunit consists of two structurally homologous    domains each containing a four stranded parallel  sheet flanked by six  helices two strictly conserved cysteine residues cys  and cys   which have been shown biochemically to act as catalytic acid and base are located on both sides of a cleft between the two domains the spatial arrangement of these two cysteine residues supports the  two base  mechanism but disproves the previous hypothesis that the active site of aspartate racemase is located at the dimeric interface the structure revealed a unique pseudo mirror symmetry in the spatial arrangement of the residues around the active site which may explain the molecular recognition mechanism of the mirror symmetric aspartate enantiomers by the non mirror symmetric aspartate racemase
