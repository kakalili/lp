hierarchical unfolding of the  lactalbumin molten globule presence of a compact intermediate without a unique tertiary fold edited by c r matthews
the difference between the framework model and the hydrophobic collapse model of protein folding largely rests on whether a secondary structure framework can exist independently of native tertiary interactions here we used circular dichroism and disulfide exchange experiments to examine the unfolding mechanism of  la   a two disulfide variant of human  lactalbumin   la that adopts a molten globule conformation under near physiological conditions our results show that as the concentration of denaturant increases the  la molten globule first loses its ability to form a specific native like tertiary fold subsequently at a higher denaturant concentration the protein loses its secondary structure and adopts an extended conformation a compact non native disulfide bond isomer which does not form significantly under both native and strongly denaturing conditions was found to be moderately populated in   m guanidine hydrochloride guhcl  qualitatively the same result was also obtained in urea these results suggest that formation of secondary structure is a necessary but not sufficient condition for formation of the native like tertiary fold and support a hierarchical model of protein folding
