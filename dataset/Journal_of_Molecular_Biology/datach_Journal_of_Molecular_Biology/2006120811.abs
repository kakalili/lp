small angle x ray scattering reveals the solution structure of a bacteriophytochrome in the catalytically active pr state
phytochromes are light sensing macromolecules that are part of a two component phosphorelay system controlling gene expression photoconversion between the pr and pfr forms facilitates autophosphorylation of a histidine in the dimerization domain dhp  we report the low resolution structure of a bacteriophytochrome bph in the catalytic ca pr form in solution determined by small angle x ray scattering saxs  ab initio modeling reveals for the first time the domain organization in a typical bacteriophytochrome comprising an chromophore binding and phytochrome phy n terminal domain followed by a c terminal histidine kinase domain homologous high resolution structures of the light sensing chromophore binding domain cbd and the cytoplasmic part of a histidine kinase sensor allows us to model   of the structure with the remainder comprising the phytochrome domain which has no d representative in the structural database the saxs data reveal a dimeric y shaped macromolecule and the relative positions of the chromophores biliverdin  autophosphorylating histidine residues and the atp molecules in the kinase domain saxs data were collected from a sample in the autophosphorylating pr form and reveal alternate conformational states for the kinase domain that can be modeled in an open no catalytic and closed catalytic state this model suggests how light induced signal transduction can stimulate autophosphorylation followed by phosphotransfer to a response regulator rr in the two component system
