architecture of the soluble receptor aer indicates an in line mechanism for pas and hamp domain signaling
bacterial receptors typically contain modular architectures with distinct functional domains that combine to send signals in response to stimuli although the properties of individual components have been investigated in many contexts there is little information about how diverse sets of modules work together in full length receptors here we investigate the architecture of aer  a soluble gas sensing receptor that has emerged as a model for pas per  arnt  sim and poly hamp histidine kinase  adenylyl cyclase  methyl accepting chemotaxis protein  phosphatase domain signaling the crystal structure of the heme binding pas domain in the ferric ligand free form in comparison to the previously determined cyanide bound state identifies conformational changes induced by ligand binding that are likely essential for the signaling mechanism heme pocket alternations share some similarities with the heme based pas sensors fixl and ecdos but propagate to the i  strand in a manner predicted to alter pas  pas associations and the downstream hamp junction within full length aer  small angle x ray scattering of pas and poly hamp domain fragments of increasing complexity allow unambiguous domain assignments and reveal a linear quaternary structure the aer pas dimeric crystal structure fits well within ab initio small angle x ray scattering molecular envelopes and pulsed dipolar esr measurements of inter pas distances confirm the crystallographic pas arrangement within aer  spectroscopic and pull down assays fail to detect direct interactions between the pas and hamp domains overall the aer signaling mechanism differs from the escherichia coli aer paradigm where side on pas  hamp contacts are key we propose an in line model for aer signaling where ligand binding induces alterations in pas domain structure and subunit association that is relayed through the poly hamp junction to downstream domains
