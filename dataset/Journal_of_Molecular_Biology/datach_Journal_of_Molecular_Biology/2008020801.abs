nucleotide mediated conformational changes of monomeric actin and arp studied by molecular dynamics simulations
members of the actin family of proteins exhibit different biochemical properties when atp adp pi adp or no nucleotide is bound we used molecular dynamics simulations to study the effect of nucleotides on the behavior of actin and actin related protein  arp  in all of the actin simulations the nucleotide cleft stayed closed as in most crystal structures adp was much more mobile within the cleft than atp despite the fact that both nucleotides adopt identical conformations in actin crystal structures the nucleotide cleft of arp opened in most simulations with atp adp and no bound nucleotide deletion of a c terminal region of arp that extends beyond the conserved actin sequence reduced the tendency of the arp cleft to open when the arp cleft opened we observed multiple instances of partial release of the nucleotide cleft opening in arp also allowed us to observe correlated movements of the phosphate clamp cleft mouth and barbed end groove providing a way for changes in the nucleotide state to be relayed to other parts of arp  the dnase binding loop of actin was highly flexible regardless of the nucleotide state the conformation of ser  thr  in the p loop was sensitive to the presence of the  phosphate but other changes observed in crystal structures were not correlated with the nucleotide state on nanosecond timescales the divalent cation occupied three positions in the nucleotide cleft one of which was not previously observed in actin or arp  complex structures in sum these simulations show that subtle differences in structures of actin family proteins have profound effects on their nucleotide driven behavior
