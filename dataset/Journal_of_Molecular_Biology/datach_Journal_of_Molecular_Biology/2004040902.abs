projection structure and oligomeric state of the osmoregulated sodium glycine betaine symporter betp of corynebacterium glutamicum
the high affinity glycine betaine uptake system betp an osmosensing and osmoregulated sodium coupled symporter from corynebacterium glutamicum was overexpressed in escherichia coli with an n terminal strepii tag solubilized in  dodecylmaltoside and purified by streptactin affinity chromatography analytical ultracentrifugation indicated that betp forms trimers in detergent solution detergent solubilized betp can be reconstituted into proteoliposomes without loss of function suggesting that betp is a trimer in the bacterial membrane reconstitution with e coli polar lipids produced d crystals with unit cell parameters of            exhibiting p   symmetry electron cryo microscopy yielded a projection map at    the unit cell contains four non crystallographic trimers of betp within each monomer ten to  density peaks characteristic of transmembrane  helices surround low density regions that define potential transport pathways small but significant differences between the three monomers indicate that the trimer does not have exact  fold symmetry the observed differences may be due to crystal packing or they may reflect different functional states of the transporter related to osmosensing and osmoregulation the projection map of betp shows no clear resemblance to other secondary transporters of known structure
