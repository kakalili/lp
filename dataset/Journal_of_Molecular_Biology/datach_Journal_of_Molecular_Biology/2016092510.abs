evidence for a helix clutch mechanism of transmembrane signaling in a bacterial chemoreceptor
the escherichia coli tsr protein contains a periplasmic serine binding domain that transmits ligand occupancy information to a cytoplasmic kinase control domain to regulate the cell  s flagellar motors the tsr input and output domains communicate through conformational changes transmitted through a transmembrane helix tm  a five residue control cable helix at the membrane cytoplasm interface and a four helix hamp bundle changes in serine occupancy are known to promote tm piston displacements in one subunit of the tsr homodimer we explored how such piston motions might be relayed through the control cable to reach the input as helix of hamp by constructing and characterizing mutant receptors that had one residue insertions or deletions in the tm control cable segment of tsr tm deletions caused kinase off output shifts tm insertions caused kinase on shifts in contrast control cable deletions caused kinase on output whereas insertions at the tm control cable junction caused kinase off output these findings rule out direct mechanical transmission of tm conformational changes to hamp instead we suggest that the tsr control cable transmits input signals to hamp by modulating the intensity of structural clashes between out of register tm and as helices inward displacement of tm might alter the sidechain environment of control cable residues at the membrane core headgroup interface causing a break in the control cable helix to attenuate the register mismatch and enhance hamp packing stability leading to a kinase off output response this helix clutch model offers a new perspective on the mechanism of transmembrane signaling in chemoreceptors
