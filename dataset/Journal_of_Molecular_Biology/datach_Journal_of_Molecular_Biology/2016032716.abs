structural insights into the hwe histidine kinase family the brucella blue light activated histidine kinase domain
in response to light as part of a two component system the brucella blue light activated histidine kinase lov hk increases its autophosphorylation modulating the virulence of this microorganism the brucella histidine kinase hk domain belongs to the hwe family for which there is no structural information the hwe family is exclusively present in proteobacteria and usually coupled to a wide diversity of light sensor domains this work reports the crystal structure of the brucella hk domain which presents two different dimeric assemblies in the asymmetric unit one similar to the already described canonical parallel homodimers c and the other an antiparallel non canonical nc dimer each with distinct relative subdomain orientations and dimerization interfaces contrary to these crystallographic structures and unlike other hks in solution the brucella hk domain is monomeric and still active showing an astonishing instability of the dimeric interface despite this instability using cross linking experiments we show that the c dimer is the functionally relevant species mutational analysis demonstrates that the autophosphorylation activity occurs in cis the different relative subdomain orientations observed for the nc and c states highlight the large conformational flexibility of the hk domain through the analysis of these alternative conformations by means of molecular dynamics simulations we also propose a catalytic mechanism for brucella lov hk
