mediator factor med p interacts with the hexokinase  implication in the glucose signalling pathway of saccharomyces cerevisiae
in the presence of glucose the protein hexokinase  hxk p  normally resident in the cytosol is translocated to the nucleus where it impairs the activation of transcription of the glucose repressed genes hxk  glk and suc  and promotes the activation of transcription of the glucose induced genes hxk and hxt  here we demonstrate the involvement of an heptameric motif named the med site in the direct binding of the mediator protein med p either as a monomer or as a homodimer because this site was previously involved in the hxk p dependent glucose induced regulation of gene transcription we tested whether hxk p interacts with med p our results show that hxk and med proteins are physically associated and that this hxk p  med p interaction is of physiological significance because both proteins have been found interacting together in a cluster with dna fragments containing the med site we conclude that hxk p operates through the med site by interacting with med p in the glucose signal transduction pathway of saccharomyces cerevisiae
