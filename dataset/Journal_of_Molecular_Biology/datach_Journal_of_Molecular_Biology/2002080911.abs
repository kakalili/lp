molecular architecture of the undecameric rotor of a bacterial na atp synthase
the sodium ion translocating f f atp synthase from the bacterium ilyobacter tartaricus contains a remarkably stable rotor ring composed of  c subunits the rotor ring was isolated crystallised in two dimensions and analysed by electron cryo microscopy here we present an  carbon model of the c subunit ring each monomeric c subunit of  amino acid residues folds into a helical hairpin consisting of two membrane spanning helices and a cytoplasmic loop the  n terminal helices are closely spaced within an inner ring surrounding a cavity of       nm  the tight helix packing leaves no space for side chains and is accounted for by a highly conserved motif of four glycine residues in the inner n terminal helix each inner helix is connected by a clearly visible loop to an outer c terminal helix the outer helix has a kink near the position of the ion binding site residue glu  in the centre of the membrane and another kink near the c terminus two helices from the outer ring and one from the inner ring form the ion binding site in the middle of the membrane and a potential access channel from the binding site to the cytoplasmic surface three possible inter subunit ion bridges are likely to account for the remarkable temperature stability of i tartaricus c rings compared to those of other organisms
