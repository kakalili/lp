characterization and mutational analysis of the recq core of the bloom syndrome protein
bloom syndrome protein forms an oligomeric ring structure and belongs to a group of dna helicases showing extensive homology to the escherichia coli dna helicase recq a suppressor of illegitimate recombination after over production in e coli we have purified the recq core of blm consisting of the deah recq ct and hrdc domains amino acid residues       the blm      fragment could function as a dna stimulated atpase and as a dna helicase displaying the same substrate specificity as the full size protein gel filtration experiments revealed that blm      exists as a monomer both in solution and in its single stranded dna bound form even in the presence of mg  and atp s rates of atp hydrolysis and dna unwinding by blm      showed a hyperbolic dependence on atp concentration excluding a co operative interaction between atp binding sites using a  spi  assay we have found that the blm      fragment is able to partially substitute for the recq helicase in suppressing illegitimate recombination in e coli a deletion of   c terminal amino acid residues of blm      including the hrdc domain resulted in helicase and single stranded dna binding defects whereas kinetic parameters for atp hydrolysis of this mutant were close to the blm      values this confirms the prediction that the hrdc domain serves as an auxiliary dna binding domain mutations at several conserved residues within the recq ct domain of blm reduced atpase and helicase activities severely as well as single stranded dna binding of the enzyme together these data define a minimal helicase domain of blm and demonstrate its ability to act as a suppressor of illegitimate recombination
