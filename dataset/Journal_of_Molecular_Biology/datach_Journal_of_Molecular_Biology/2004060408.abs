the folding transition state of the cold shock protein is strongly polarized
the cold shock protein cspb from bacillus subtilis consists of a three stranded       and a two stranded       sheet which form a closed  barrel structure cspb folds and unfolds rapidly in a two state reaction and the unfolded and the folded molecules interconvert with a time constant of  ms at the midpoint of the urea induced transition at   c  the transition state of folding is native like as judged by the tanford  t value of     by using a mutational approach and  value analysis we find that the folding transition state of cspb is energetically polarized despite the high  t value most  values are low values close to  were found for only a few residues particularly in strand   lys  val  lys  asn   the interactions of the asn  side chain with the backbone at positions  and  define the turn that connects the strands   and   lys and val in   interact with residues in   and their high  values indicate that an energetic linkage between   and   and thus between the two sheets exists already in the transition state we compared our experimental  values with theoretical predictions of the folding pathway of cold shock proteins several of them suggest that the entire first sheet is formed in the transition state and some identify the      pairing as a crucial step in folding alternative paths that involve formation of the second sheet and      pairing reactions were however suggested as well the calculations gave coarse grained pictures that are limited in resolution to the two sheets of cspb or to the elements of secondary structure they did not identify the key residues with the high  values within these structural elements
