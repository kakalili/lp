non sequence specific interactions can account for the compaction of proteins unfolded under  native  conditions
proteins unfolded by high concentrations of chemical denaturants adopt expanded largely structure free ensembles of conformations that are well approximated as random coils in contrast globular proteins unfolded under less denaturing conditions via mutations or transiently unfolded after a rapid jump to native conditions and molten globules arising due to mutations or cosolvents are often compact here we explore the origins of this compaction using a truncated equilibrium unfolded variant of the  residue fynsh domain as monitored by far uv circular dichroism nmr spectroscopy and hydrogen exchange kinetics c   a  residue carboxy terminal deletion variant of fynsh  appears to be largely unfolded even in the absence of denaturant nevertheless c  is quite compact under these conditions with a hydrodynamic radius only slightly larger than that of the native protein in order to understand the origins of this molten globule like compaction we have characterized a random sequence polypeptide of identical amino acid composition to c   notably we find that the hydrodynamic radius of this random sequence polypeptide also approaches that of the native protein thus while native like interactions may contribute to the formation of compact  unfolded  states it appears that non sequence specific monomer  monomer interactions can also account for the dramatic compaction observed for molten globules and the  physiological  unfolded state
