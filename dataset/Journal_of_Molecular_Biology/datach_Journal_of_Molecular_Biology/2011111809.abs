the rate of polymerase release upon filling the gap between okazaki fragments is inadequate to support cycling during lagging strand synthesis
upon completion of synthesis of an okazaki fragment the lagging strand replicase must recycle to the next primer at the replication fork in under   s to sustain the physiological rate of dna synthesis we tested the collision model that posits that cycling is triggered by the polymerase encountering the   end of the preceding okazaki fragment probing with surface plasmon resonance dna polymerase iii holoenzyme initiation complexes were formed on an immobilized gapped template initiation complexes exhibit a half life of dissociation of approximately   min reduction in gap size to  nt increased the rate of dissociation   fold and complete filling of the gap increased the off rate an additional  fold t     min  an exogenous primed template and atp accelerated dissociation an additional  fold in a reaction that required complete filling of the gap neither a   triphosphate nor a   rna terminated oligonucleotide downstream of the polymerase accelerated dissociation further thus the rate of polymerase release upon gap completion and collision with a downstream okazaki fragment is   fold too slow to support an adequate rate of cycling and likely provides a backup mechanism to enable polymerase release when the other cycling signals are absent kinetic measurements indicate that addition of the last nucleotide to fill the gap is not the rate limiting step for polymerase release and cycling modest approximately  nt strand displacement is observed after the gap between model okazaki fragments is filled to determine the identity of the protein that senses gap filling to modulate affinity of the replicase for the template we performed photo cross linking experiments with highly reactive and non chemoselective diazirines only the  subunit cross linked indicating that it serves as the sensor
