trna  s wobble decoding of the genome   years of modification
the genetic code is degenerate in that  amino acids are encoded by  triplet codes in    francis crick hypothesized that the cell s limited number of trnas decoded the genome by recognizing more than one codon the ambiguity of that recognition resided in the third base pair giving rise to the wobble hypothesis post transcriptional modifications at trna s wobble position   especially modifications of uridine   enable wobble to occur the modified wobble hypothesis proposed in   that specific modifications of a trna wobble nucleoside shape the anticodon architecture in such a manner that interactions were restricted to the complementary base plus a single wobble pairing for amino acids with twofold degenerate codons however chemically different modifications at position  would expand the ability of a trna to read three or even four of the fourfold degenerate codons one foundation of crick s wobble hypothesis was that a near constant geometry of canonical base pairing be maintained in forming all three base pairs between the trna anticodon and mrna codon on the ribosome in accepting an aminoacyl trna the ribosome requires maintenance of a specific geometry for the anticodon codon base pairing however it is the post transcriptional modifications at trna wobble position  and purine     adjacent to the anticodon that pre structure the anticodon domain to ensure the correct codon binding the modifications create both the architecture and the stability needed for decoding through restraints on anticodon stereochemistry and conformational space and through selective hydrogen bonding a physicochemical understanding of modified nucleoside contributions to the trna anticodon domain architecture and its decoding of the genome has advanced rna world evolutionary theory the principles of rna chemistry and the application of this knowledge to the introduction of new amino acids to proteins
