conformational transitions and alternating access mechanism in the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump
ion pumps are integral membrane proteins responsible for transporting ions against concentration gradients across biological membranes sarco endoplasmic reticulum ca  atpase serca  a member of the p type atpases family transports two calcium ions per hydrolyzed atp molecule via an  alternating access  mechanism high resolution crystallographic structures provide invaluable insight on the structural mechanism of the ion pumping process however to understand the molecular details of how atp hydrolysis is coupled to calcium transport it is necessary to gain knowledge about the conformational transition pathways connecting the crystallographically resolved conformations large scale transitions in serca occur at time scales beyond the current reach of unbiased molecular dynamics simulations here we overcome this challenge by employing the string method which represents a transition pathway as a chain of states linking two conformational endpoints using a multiscale methodology we have determined all atom transition pathways for three main conformational transitions responsible for the alternating access mechanism the present pathways provide a clear chronology and ordering of the key events underlying the active transport of calcium ions by serca important conclusions are that the conformational transition that leads to occlusion with bound atp and calcium is highly concerted and cooperative the phosphorylation of asp  causes a reorganization of the cytoplasmic domains that subsequently drives the opening of the luminal gate and the reclosing of luminal gate induces a shift in the cytoplasmic domains that subsequently enables the dephosphorylation of asp  p formation of transient residue  residue contacts along the conformational transitions predicted by the computations provide an experimental route to test the general validity of the computational pathways
