nucleic acid conformational changes essential for hiv  nucleocapsid protein mediated inhibition of self priming in minus strand transfer
reverse transcription of the hiv  genome is a complex multi step process hiv  nucleocapsid protein nc is a nucleic acid chaperone protein that has been shown to greatly facilitate the nucleic acid rearrangements that precede the minus strand transfer step in reverse transcription nc destabilizes the highly structured transactivation response region tar present in the r region of the rna genome as well as a complementary hairpin structure   tar dna   at the   end of the newly synthesized minus strand strong stop dna    ssdna  melting of the latter structure inhibits a self priming sp reaction that competes with the strand transfer reaction in an in vitro minus strand transfer system consisting of a    ssdna mimic and a tar containing acceptor rna molecule we find that when both nucleic acids are present nc facilitates formation of the transfer product and the sp reaction is greatly reduced in contrast in the absence of the acceptor rna nc has only a small inhibitory effect on the sp reaction to further investigate nc mediated inhibition of sp we developed a fret based assay that allows us to directly monitor conformational changes in the tar dna structure upon nc binding although the majority     of the tar dna molecules assume a folded hairpin conformation in the absence of nc two minor  semi folded  and  unfolded  populations are also observed upon nc binding to the tar dna alone we observe a modest shift in the population towards the less folded states in the presence of the rna acceptor molecule nc binding to tar dna results in a shift of the majority of molecules to the unfolded state these measurements help to explain why acceptor rna is required for significant inhibition of the sp reaction by nc and support the hypothesis that nc mediated annealing of nucleic acids is a concerted process wherein the unwinding step occurs in synchrony with hybridization
