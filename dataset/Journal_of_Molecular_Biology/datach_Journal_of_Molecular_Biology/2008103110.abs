down regulation of outer membrane proteins by noncoding rnas unraveling the camp  crp and  e dependent cyar  ompx regulatory case
the  e extracytoplasmic stress response sigma factor in escherichia coli signaling system of gram negative bacteria plays an essential role in the maintenance of the extracytoplasmic compartment upon induction of this system approximately   genes are up regulated the majority of these genes encode proteins that participate in the synthesis assembly and homeostasis of outer membrane proteins and lipopolysaccharides a second aspect of the  e response is a regulatory loop that prevents expression of the major porins misfolding or overproduction of most of these porins is sufficient to trigger the envelope stress response recent work indicates that small hfq binding rnas play a major role in maintaining envelope homeostasis and so far two  e dependent small noncoding rnas srnas  mica and rybb have been shown to facilitate rapid removal of multiple omp transcripts in response to elevated activity of the alternative sigma factor here we report the identification of the srna cyar cyclic amp activated rna that promotes decay of the ompx mrna the transcription of the cyar gene is stringently controlled by camp  camp receptor protein and unexpectedly cyar expression is also up regulated directly or indirectly by  e in addition this work identified mica as a factor that cooperates in the negative control of ompx expression the conservation of cyar mica rybb and their targets suggests that the omp mrna  srna regulatory network is an integral part of the envelope stress response in many enterobacteria
