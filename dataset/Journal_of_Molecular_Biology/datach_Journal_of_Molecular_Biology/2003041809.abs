homologous proteins with different folds the three dimensional structures of domains  and  of the multiple kazal type inhibitor lekti
we have determined the solution structures of recombinant domain  and native domain  of the multi domain kazal type serine proteinase inhibitor lekti using multi dimensional nmr spectroscopy while two of the  potential inhibitory lekti domains contain three disulfide bonds typical of kazal type inhibitors the remaining  domains have only two of these disulfide bridges therefore they may represent a novel type of serine proteinase inhibitor the first and the sixth lekti domain which have been isolated from human blood ultrafiltrate belong to this group in spite of sharing the same disulfide pattern and a sequence identity of about   from the first to the fourth cysteine the two proteins show different structures in this region the three dimensional structure of domain  consists of two helices and a  hairpin structure and closely resembles the three dimensional fold of classical kazal type serine proteinase inhibitors including the inhibitory binding loop domain  has been shown to be an efficient but non permanent serine proteinase inhibitor the backbone geometry of its canonical loop is not as well defined as the remaining structural elements providing a possible explanation for its non permanent inhibitory activity we conclude that domain  belongs to a subfamily of classical kazal type inhibitors as the third disulfide bond and a third  strand are missing the three dimensional structure of domain  shows three helices and a  hairpin but the central part of the structure differs remarkably from that of domain  the sequence adopting hairpin structure in domain  exhibits helical conformation in domain  and none of the residues within the putative p to p   stretch features backbone angles that resemble those of the canonical loop of known proteinase inhibitors no proteinase has been found to be inhibited by domain  we conclude that domain  adopts a new protein fold and is no canonical serine proteinase inhibitor
