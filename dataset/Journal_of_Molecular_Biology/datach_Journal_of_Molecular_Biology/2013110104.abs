a gene specific method for predicting hemophilia causing point mutations
a fundamental goal of medical genetics is the accurate prediction of genotype  phenotype correlations as an approach to develop more accurate in silico tools for prediction of disease causing mutations of structural proteins we present a gene and disease specific prediction tool based on a large systematic analysis of missense mutations from hemophilia a ha patients our ha specific prediction tool hapredictor showed disease prediction accuracy comparable to other publicly available prediction software in contrast to those methods its performance is not limited to non synonymous mutations given the role of synonymous mutations in disease and drug codon optimization we propose that utilizing a gene and disease specific method can be highly useful to make functional predictions possible even for synonymous mutations incorporating computational metrics at both nucleotide and amino acid levels along with multiple protein sequence structure alignment significantly improved the predictive performance of our tool hapredictor is freely available for download at http  www ncbi nlm nih gov cbbresearch przytycka ha predict index htm
