the crystal structure and catalytic mechanism of cellobiohydrolase cels the major enzymatic component of the clostridium thermocellum cellulosome
cellobiohydrolase cels plays an important role in the cellulosome an active cellulase system produced by the thermophilic anaerobe clostridium thermocellum the structures of the catalytic domain of cels in complex with substrate cellohexaose and product cellobiose were determined at   and    resolution respectively the protein folds into an     barrel with a tunnel shaped substrate binding region the conformation of the loops defining the tunnel is intrinsically stable in the absence of substrate suggesting a model to account for the processive mode of action of family  cellobiohydrolases structural comparisons with other     barrel glycosidases indicate that cels and endoglucanase cela a sequence unrelated family  glycosidase with a groove shaped substrate binding region use the same catalytic machinery to hydrolyze the glycosidic linkage despite a low sequence similarity and a different endo exo mode of action a remarkable feature of the mechanism is the absence from cels of a carboxylic group acting as the base catalyst the nearly identical arrangement of substrate and functionally important residues in the two active sites strongly suggests an evolutionary relationship between the cellobiohydrolase and endoglucanase families which can therefore be classified into a new clan of glycoside hydrolases
