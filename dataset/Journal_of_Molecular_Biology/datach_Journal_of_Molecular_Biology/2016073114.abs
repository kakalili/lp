chaperonin groel  groes functions as both alternating and non alternating engines
a double ring shaped groel consisting of  atpase subunits assists protein folding together with co chaperonin groes the dynamic groel  groes interaction is actively involved in the chaperonin reaction therefore revealing this dynamic interaction is a key to understanding the operation principle of groel nevertheless how this interaction proceeds in the reaction cycle has long been controversial here we directly imaged groel  groes interaction in the presence of disulfide reduced  lactalbumin as a substrate protein using high speed atomic force microscopy this real time imaging revealed the occurrence of primary symmetric groel groes and secondary asymmetric groel groes complexes remarkably the reaction was observed to often branch into main and side pathways in the main pathway alternate binding and release of groes occurs at the two rings indicating tight cooperation between the two rings in the side pathway however this cooperation is disrupted resulting in the interruption of alternating rhythm from various properties observed for both pathways we provide mechanistic insight into the alternate and non alternate operations of the two engine system
