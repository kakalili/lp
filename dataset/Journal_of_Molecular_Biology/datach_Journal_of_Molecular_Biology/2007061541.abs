antibody induced oligomerization and activation of an engineered reporter enzyme
our objective is to produce a protein biosensor or molecular switch that is specifically activated in solution by a monoclonal antibody many effector dependent enzymes have evolved in nature but the introduction of a novel regulatory mechanism into a normally unregulated enzyme poses a difficult design problem we used site saturation mutagenesis and screening to generate effector activated variants of the reporter enzyme  glucuronidase gus  the specific activity of the purified epitope tagged gus variant was increased by up to    fold by the addition of an equimolar concentration of a monoclonal antibody this molecular switch is modular in design so it can easily be re engineered for the detection of other peptide specific antibodies such antibody activated reporters could someday enable point of care serological assays for the rapid detection of infectious diseases
