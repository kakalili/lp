the response of greek key proteins to changes in connectivity depends on the nature of their secondary structure
what governs the balance between connectivity and topology in regulating the mechanism of protein folding we use circular permutation to vary the order of the helices in the all  greek key protein fadd fas associated death domain to investigate this question unlike all  greek key proteins where changes in the order of secondary structure cause a shift in the folding nucleus the position of the nucleus in fadd is unchanged even when permutation reduces the complexity significantly we suggest that this is because local helical contacts are so dominant that permutation has little effect on the entropic cost of forming the folding nucleus whereas in all  greek key proteins all interactions in the nucleus are long range thus the type of secondary structure modulates the sensitivity of proteins to changes in connectivity
