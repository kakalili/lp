different requirements of the kinase and uhm domains of kis for its nuclear localization and binding to splicing factors
the protein kinase kis is made by the juxtaposition of a unique kinase domain and a c terminal domain with a u af homology motif uhm  a sequence motif for protein interaction initially identified in the heterodimeric pre mrna splicing factor u af this domain of kis is closely related to the c terminal uhm domain of the u af large subunit u af  kis phosphorylates the splicing factor sf  which in turn enhances sf binding to u af  and the   splice site an event known to take place at an early step of spliceosome assembly here the analysis of the subcellular localization of mutated forms of kis indicates that the kinase domain of kis is the necessary domain for its nuclear localization as in the case of u af  the uhm containing c terminal domain of kis is required for binding to the splicing factors sf and sf b   the efficiency of kis binding to sf and sf b  is similar to that of u af  in pull down assays these results further support the functional link of kis with splicing factors interestingly when compared to other uhm containing proteins kis presents a different specificity for the uhm docking sites that are present in the n terminal region of sf b   thus providing a new insight into the variety of interactions mediated by uhm domains
