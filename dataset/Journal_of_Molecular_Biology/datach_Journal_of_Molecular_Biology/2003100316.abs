the    resolution structure of rpib alsb from escherichia coli illustrates a new approach to the ribose  phosphate isomerase reaction
ribose  phosphate isomerases ec     interconvert ribose  phosphate and ribulose  phosphate this reaction permits the synthesis of ribose from other sugars as well as the recycling of sugars from nucleotide breakdown two unrelated types of enzyme can catalyze the reaction the most common rpia is present in almost all organisms including escherichia coli  and is highly conserved the second type rpib is present in some bacterial and eukaryotic species and is well conserved in e coli rpib is sometimes referred to as alsb because it can take part in the metabolism of the rare sugar allose as well as the much more common ribose sugars we report here the structure of rpib alsb from e coli solved by multi wavelength anomalous diffraction mad phasing and refined to    resolution rpib is the first structure to be solved from pfam    the rpib lacab family  it exhibits a rossmann type    sandwich fold that is common to many nucleotide binding proteins as well as other proteins with different functions this structure is quite distinct from that of the previously solved rpia although both are to some extent based on the rossmann fold their tertiary and quaternary structures are very different the four molecules in the rpib asymmetric unit represent a dimer of dimers active site residues were identified at the interface between the subunits such that each active site has contributions from both subunits kinetic studies indicate that rpib is nearly as efficient as rpia despite its completely different catalytic machinery the sequence and structural results further suggest that the two homologous components of lacab galactose  phosphate isomerase will compose a bi functional enzyme the second activity is unknown
