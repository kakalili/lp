crystallographic and in silico analysis of the sialoside binding characteristics of the siglec sialoadhesin
the siglec family of receptors mediates cell surface interactions through recognition of sialylated glycoconjugates previously reported structures of the n terminal domain of the siglec sialoadhesin snd  in complex with various sialic acid analogs revealed the structural template for sialic acid binding to characterize further the carbohydrate binding properties we have determined the crystal structures of snd in the absence of ligand and in complex with  benzyl neu npro and  benzyl neu nac these structures reveal that snd undergoes very few structural changes on ligand binding and detail how two novel classes of sialic acid analogs bind one of which unexpectedly can induce siglec dimerization in conjunction with in silico analysis this set of structures informs us about the design of putative ligands with enhanced binding affinities and specificities to different siglecs and provides data with which to test the effectiveness of different computational drug design protocols
