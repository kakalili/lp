expression of distinct classes of titin isoforms in striated and smooth muscles by alternative splicing and their conserved interaction with filamins
while the role of titin as a sarcomeric protein is well established its potential functional role s in smooth muscles and non muscle tissues are controversial we used a titin exon array to search for which part s of the human titin transcriptional unit encompassing   exons is are expressed in non striated muscle tissues expression profiling of adult smooth muscle tissues aorta bladder carotid stomach identified alternatively spliced titin isoforms encompassing  to about   exons these exons code for parts of the titin z disk i band and a band regions allowing the truncated smooth muscle titin isoform to link z disks dense bodies together with thick filaments consistent with the array data western blot studies detected the expression of    mda smooth muscle titin in adult smooth muscles reacting with selected z disc i band and a band titin antibodies immunofluorescence with these antibodies located smooth muscle titin in the cytoplasm of cultured human aortic smooth muscle cells and in the tunica media of intact adult bovine aorta real time pcr studies suggested that smooth muscle titins are expressed from a promoter located   kb or more upstream of the transcription initiation site used for striated muscle titin driving expression of a bi cistronic mrna coding   for the anonymous gene fl    followed   by titin respectively our work showed that smooth muscle and striated muscle titins share in their conserved amino terminal regions binding sites for  actinin and filamins yeast two hybrid screens using z zis titin baits identified prey clones coding for  actinin  and filamin a from smooth muscle and  actinin   filamin c and nebulin from skeletal muscle cdna libraries respectively this suggests that the titin z zis domain can link filamins and  actinin together in the periphery of the z line dense bodies in a fashion that is conserved in smooth and striated muscles
