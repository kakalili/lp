drosophila ctcf is required for fab  enhancer blocking activity in s cells
ctcf is a conserved transcriptional regulator with binding sites in dna insulators identified in vertebrates and invertebrates the drosophila abdominal b locus contains ctcf binding sites in the fab  dna insulator previous reports have shown that fab  has enhancer blocking activity in drosophila transgenic assays we now confirm the enhancer blocking capability of the fab  insulator in stably transfected drosophila s cells and show this activity depends on the fab  ctcf binding sites furthermore knockdown of drosophila ctcf by rnai in our stable cell lines demonstrates that ctcf itself is critical for fab  enhancer blocking
