functional monomerization of a clc type fluoride transporter
anion channels and antiporters of the clc superfamily have been found to be exclusively dimeric in nature even though each individual monomer contains the complete transport pathway here we describe the destabilization through mutagenesis of the dimer interface of a bacterial f  h antiporter clcf eca several mutations that produce monomer dimer equilibrium of the normally dimeric transporter were found simply by shortening a hydrophobic side chain in some cases one mutation l  w leads to a wholly monomeric variant that shows full activity furthermore we discovered a naturally destabilized homologue clcf rla which undergoes partial monomerization in detergent without additional mutations these results in combination with the previous functional monomerization of the distant relative clc ec  demonstrate that the monomer alone is the functional unit for several clades of the clc superfamily
