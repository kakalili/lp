quantitative assessment of peptide sequence diversity in m  combinatorial peptide phage display libraries
novel statistical methods have been developed and used to quantitate and annotate the sequence diversity within combinatorial peptide libraries on the basis of small numbers      of sequences selected at random from commercially available m  p based phage display libraries these libraries behave statistically as though they correspond to populations containing roughly      of the random dodecapeptides and      of the random constrained heptapeptides that are theoretically possible within the phage populations analysis of amino acid residue occurrence patterns shows no demonstrable influence on sequence censorship by escherichia coli trna isoacceptor profiles or either overall codon or class ii codon usage patterns suggesting no metabolic constraints on recombinant p synthesis there is an overall depression in the occurrence of cysteine arginine and glycine residues and an overabundance of proline threonine and histidine residues the majority of position dependent amino acid sequence bias is clustered at three positions within the inserted peptides of the dodecapeptide library     and   downstream from the signal peptidase cleavage site conformational tendency measures of the peptides indicate a significant preference for inserts favoring a  turn conformation the observed protein sequence limitations can primarily be attributed to genetic codon degeneracy and signal peptidase cleavage preferences these data suggest that for applications in which maximal sequence diversity is essential such as epitope mapping or novel receptor identification combinatorial peptide libraries should be constructed using codon corrected trinucleotide cassettes within vector  host systems designed to minimize morphogenesis related censorship
