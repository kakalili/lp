two cooperating helices constitute the lipid binding domain of the bacterial srp receptor
protein targeting by the bacterial signal recognition particle requires the specific interaction of the signal recognition particle srp  ribosome  nascent chain complex with ftsy the bacterial srp receptor although ftsy in escherichia coli lacks a transmembrane domain the membrane bound ftsy displays many features of an integral membrane protein our data reveal that it is the cooperative action of two lipid binding helices that allows this unusually strong membrane contact helix i comprises the first  amino acids of ftsy and the second is located at the interface between the a and the n domain of ftsy we show by site directed cross linking and binding assays that both helices bind to negatively charged phospholipids with a preference for phosphatidyl glycerol despite the strong lipid binding helix i does not seem to be completely inserted into the lipid phase but appears to be oriented parallel with the membrane surface the two helices together with the connecting linker constitute an independently folded domain which maintains its lipid binding even in the absence of the conserved ng core of ftsy in summary our data reveal that the two consecutive lipid binding helices of ftsy can provide a membrane contact that does not differ significantly in stability from that provided by a transmembrane domain this explains why the bacterial srp receptor does not require an integral  subunit for membrane binding
