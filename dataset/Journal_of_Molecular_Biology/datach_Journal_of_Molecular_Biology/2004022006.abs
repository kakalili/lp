dna double strand breaks induce deletion of ctg cag repeats in an orientation dependent manner in escherichia coli
the influences of double strand breaks dsbs within a triplet repeat sequence on its genetic instabilities expansions and deletions related to hereditary neurological diseases was investigated plasmids containing  or  ctg cag repeats or  cgg ccg repeats were linearized in vitro near the center of the repeats and were transformed into parental reca dependent homologous recombination deficient or recbc exonuclease deficient escherichia coli the resulting repair process considerably increased deletion of the repeating sequence compared to the circular dna controls unexpectedly the orientation of the insert relative to the unidirectional cole origin of replication affected the amount of instability generated during the repair of the dsb when the ctg strand was the template for lagging strand synthesis instability was increased most markedly in the reca  strain results indicated that reca and or recbc might play a role in dsb repair within the triplet repeat altering the length orientation and sequence composition of the triplet repeat suggested an important role of dna secondary structures during repair intermediates hence we hypothesize that cole origin dependent replication was involved during the repair of the dsb a model is presented to explain the mechanisms of the observed genetic instabilities
