cryoelectron microscopy structure of purified  secretase at    resolution
secretase an integral membrane protein complex catalyzes the intramembrane cleavage of the  amyloid precursor protein app during the neuronal production of the amyloid  peptide as such the protease has emerged as a key target for developing agents to treat and prevent alzheimer s disease existing biochemical studies conflict on the oligomeric assembly state of the protease complex and its detailed structure is not known here we report that purified active human  secretase in digitonin has a total molecular mass of     kda when measured by scanning transmission electron microscopy this result supports a complex that is monomeric for each of the four component proteins we further report the three dimensional structure of the  secretase complex at    resolution as obtained by cryoelectron microscopy and single particle image reconstruction the structure reveals several domains on the extracellular side three solvent accessible low density cavities and a potential substrate binding surface groove in the transmembrane region of the complex
