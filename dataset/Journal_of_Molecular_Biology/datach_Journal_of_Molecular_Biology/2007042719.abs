hierarchical disabled  tyrosine phosphorylation in src family kinase activation and neurite formation
there are two developmentally regulated alternatively spliced forms of disabled  dab  in the chick retina an early form dab e expressed in retinal precursor cells and a late form dab l expressed in neuronal cells the main difference between these two isoforms is the absence of two src family kinase sfk recognition sites in dab e both forms retain two abl crk nck recognition sites implicated in the recruitment of sh domain containing signaling proteins one of the dab l specific sfk recognition sites at tyrosine y    has been shown to be phosphorylated in reelin stimulated neurons here we use reelin expressing primary retinal cultures to investigate the role of the four dab tyrosine phosphorylation sites on overall tyrosine phosphorylation dab phosphorylation sfk activation and neurite formation we show that y  is essential but not sufficient for maximal dab phosphorylation sfk activation and neurite formation with y  and y  playing particularly important roles in sfk activation and neuritogenesis and y  having modifying effects secondary to y  and y   our data support a role for all four dab tyrosine phosphorylation sites in mediating the spectrum of activities associated with reelin dab signaling in neurons
