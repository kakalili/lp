transcriptional response of candida albicans to hypoxia linkage of oxygen sensing and efg p regulatory networks
the major human fungal pathogen candida albicans colonizes different body sites differing greatly in oxygen levels using whole genome dna microarrays we analysed the transcriptomal response of c albicans to hypoxia in this condition transcripts of genes involved in fermentative metabolism including glycolytic genes as well as hypha specific genes were up regulated in contrast genes regulating oxidative metabolism were down regulated although the morphogenetic and metabolic regulator efg p regulates these genes during normoxia we found that efg p is not involved in their hypoxic regulation instead efg p was specifically required for hypoxic expression or repression of subsets of genes one class of hypoxia regulated genes encoding proteins involved in fatty acid biosynthesis was dependent on efg p for maximal hypoxic expression requiring efg p for transcriptional activation during hypoxia efg mutants contained lower levels of unsaturated fatty acids while hyphal morphogenesis on solid media was significantly increased at temperatures lt    c these results suggest that during oxygen limitation efg p acts as a repressor of filamentation and as a positive regulator of fatty acid desaturation we discuss that c albicans responds to hypoxia largely by different mechanisms compared to budding yeast and that hypoxic adaptation requiring efg p is crucial for successful infection of human cells and tissues
