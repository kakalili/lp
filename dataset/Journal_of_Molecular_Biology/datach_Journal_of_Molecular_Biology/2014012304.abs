spontaneous aggregation of the insulin derived steric zipper peptide vealyl results in different aggregation forms with common features
recently several short peptides have been shown to self assemble into amyloid fibrils with generic cross  spines so called steric zippers suggesting common underlying structural features and aggregation mechanisms understanding these mechanisms is a prerequisite for designing fibril binding compounds and inhibitors of fibril formation the hexapeptide vealyl corresponding to the residues b   of full length insulin has been identified as one of these short segments here we analyzed the structures of multiple morphologically different fibrillar microcrystal like oligomeric   c  n vealyl samples by solid state nuclear magnetic resonance complemented with results from molecular dynamics simulations by performing nhhc chhc experiments we could determine that the  strands within a given sheet of the amyloid like fibrils formed by the insulin hexapeptide vealyl are stacked in an antiparallel manner whereas the sheet to sheet packing arrangement was found to be parallel experimentally observed secondary chemical shifts for all aggregate forms as well as   and  backbone torsion angles calculated with talos are indicative of  strand conformation consistent with the published crystal structure pdb id  omq  thus we could demonstrate that the structural features of all the observed vealyl aggregates are in agreement with the previously observed homosteric zipper spine packing in the crystalline state suggesting that several distinct aggregate morphologies share the same molecular architecture
