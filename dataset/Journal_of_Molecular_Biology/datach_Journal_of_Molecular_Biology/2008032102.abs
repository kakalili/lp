crystal structures of arabidopsis thaliana cell wall invertase mutants in complex with sucrose
in plants cell wall invertases fulfil important roles in carbohydrate partitioning growth development and crop yield in this study we report on different x ray crystal structures of arabidopsis thaliana cell wall invertase  atcwinv  mutants with sucrose these structures reveal a detailed view of sucrose binding in the active site of the wild type atcwinv  compared to related enzyme  sucrose complexes important differences in the orientation of the glucose subunit could be observed the structure of the e  q atcwinv mutant showed a complete new binding modus whereas the d a e  a and d  a structures most likely represent the productive binding modus together with a hydrophobic zone formed by the conserved w  w  and w  the residues n  d  r   e   d  and d  are necessary to create the ideal sucrose binding pocket d  can interact directly with the glucose moiety of sucrose whereas k  has an indirect role in substrate stabilization most probably k  keeps d  in a favourable position upon substrate binding unravelling the exact position of sucrose in plant cell wall invertases is a necessary step towards the rational design of superior invertases to further increase crop yield and biomass production
