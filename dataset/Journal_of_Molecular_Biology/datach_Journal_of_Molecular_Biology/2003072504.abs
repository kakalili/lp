crystal structure of iscs a cysteine desulfurase from escherichia coli
iscs is a widely distributed cysteine desulfurase that catalyzes the pyridoxal phosphate dependent desulfuration of l cysteine and plays a central role in the delivery of sulfur to a variety of metabolic pathways we report the crystal structure of escherichia coli iscs to a resolution of    the crystals belong to the space group p    and have unit cell dimensions a     b      c              molecular replacement with the thermotoga maritima nifs model was used to determine phasing and the iscs model was refined to an r    rfree    with two molecules per asymmetric unit the structure of e coli iscs is similar to that of t maritima nifs with nearly identical secondary structure and an overall backbone r m s difference of    however in contrast to nifs a peptide segment containing the catalytic cysteine residue cys   is partially ordered in the iscs structure this segment of iscs residues      forms a surface loop directed away from the active site pocket cys  is positioned greater than   from the pyridoxal phosphate cofactor suggesting that a large conformational change must occur during catalysis in order for cys  to participate in nucleophilic attack of a pyridoxal phosphate bound cysteine substrate modeling suggests that rotation of this loop may allow movement of cys  to within    of the pyridoxal phosphate cofactor
