conformational selection in substrate recognition by hsp  chaperones
hsp s are molecular chaperones involved in the folding and assembly of proteins they recognize hydrophobic amino acid stretches in their substrate binding groove however a detailed understanding of substrate specificity is still missing here we use the endoplasmic reticulum resident hsp  bip to identify binding sites in a natural client protein two sites are mutually recognized and form stable hsp   substrate complexes in silico and in vitro analyses revealed an extended substrate conformation as a crucial factor for interaction and show an unexpected plasticity of the substrate binding groove the basic binding mechanism is conserved among different hsp s
