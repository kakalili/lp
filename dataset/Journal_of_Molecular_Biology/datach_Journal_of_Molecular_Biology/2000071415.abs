crystal structure of streptomyces olivaceoviridis e    xylanase containing xylan binding domain  edited by r huber
xylanases hydrolyse the    glycosidic bonds within the xylan backbone and belong to either family  or  of the glycoside hydrolases on the basis of the amino acid sequence similarities of their catalytic domains generally xylanases have a core catalytic domain an n and or c terminal substrate binding domain and a linker region until now x ray structural analyses of family  xylanases have been reported only for their catalytic domains and do not contain substrate binding domains we have determined the crystal structure of a family  xylanase containing the xylan binding domain xbd from streptomyces olivaceoviridis e  at    resolution the catalytic domain comprises a     barrel topologically identical to other family  xylanases xbd has three similar subdomains as suggested from a triple repeat sequence which are assembled against one another around a pseudo  fold axis forming a galactose binding lectin fold similar to ricin b chain the gly pro rich linker region connecting the catalytic domain and xbd is not visible in the electron density map probably because of its flexibility the interface of the two domains in the crystal is hydrophilic where five direct hydrogen bonds and water mediated hydrogen bonds exist the sugar binding residues seen in ricin lactose complex are spatially conserved among the three subdomains in xbd suggesting that all of the subdomains in xbd have the capacity to bind sugars the flexible linker region enables the two domains to move independently and may provide a triple chance of substrate capturing and catalysis the structure reported here represents an example where the metabolic enzyme uses a ricin type lectin motif for capturing the insoluble substrate and promoting catalysis
