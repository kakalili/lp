crystal structures of mmp  complexes with five inhibitors contribution of the flexible arg  side chain to selectivity
human matrix metalloproteinase  mmp   also called gelatinase b is particularly involved in inflammatory processes bone remodelling and wound healing but is also implicated in pathological processes such as rheumatoid arthritis atherosclerosis tumour growth and metastasis we have prepared the inactive e  q mutant of the truncated catalytic domain of human mmp  and co crystallized it with active site directed synthetic inhibitors of different binding types here we present the x ray structures of five mmp  complexes with gelatinase specific tight binding inhibitors a phosphinic acid am    a pyrimidine    trione ro      two carboxylate an  and mj   and a trifluoromethyl hydroxamic acid inhibitor ms    these compounds bind by making a compromise between optimal coordination of the catalytic zinc favourable hydrogen bond formation in the active site cleft and accommodation of their large hydrophobic p   groups in the slightly flexible s   cavity which exhibits distinct rotational conformations of the pro  carbonyl group in each complex in all these structures the side chain of arg  located at the bottom of the s   cavity is not defined in the electron density beyond c  indicating its mobility however we suggest that the mobile arg  side chain partially blocks the s   cavity which might explain the weaker binding of most inhibitors with a long p   side chain for mmp  compared with the closely related mmp  gelatinase a  which exhibits a short threonine side chain at the equivalent position these novel structural details should facilitate the design of more selective mmp  inhibitors
