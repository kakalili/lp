membrane binding motif of the p type cardiotoxin edited by b holland
carditoxins ctxs from cobra snake venoms the basic     residue all beta sheet polypeptides are known to bind to and impair the function of cell membranes to assess the membrane induced conformation and orientation of ctxs the interaction of the p type cardiotoxin ii from naja oxiana snake venom ctii with perdeuterated dodecylphosphocholine dpc was studied using h nmr spectroscopy and diffusion measurements under conditions where the toxin formed a well defined complex with dpc the spatial structure of ctii with respect to the presence of tightly bound water molecules in loop ii was calculated using the torsion angle dynamics program dyana the structure was found to be similar except for subtle changes in the tips of all three loops to the previously described  major  form of ctii in aqueous solution illustrated by the  trans  configuration of the val pro peptide bond no  minor  form with the  cis  configuration of the above bond was found in the micelle bound state the broadening of the ctii backbone proton signals by    doxylstearate relaxation probes together with modeling based on the spatial structure of ctii indicated a periphery mode of binding of the toxin molecule to the micelle and revealed its micelle interacting domain the latter includes a hydrophobic region of ctii within the extremities of loops i and iii residues          the basement of loop ii residues         and the belt of polar residues encircling these loops lysines        serines    histidine   arginine   it is suggested that this structural motif and the mode of binding can be realized during interaction of ctxs with lipid and biological membranes
