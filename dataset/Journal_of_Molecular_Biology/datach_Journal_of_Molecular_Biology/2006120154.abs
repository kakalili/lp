synergistic inhibition of hiv  envelope mediated membrane fusion by inhibitors targeting the n and c terminal heptad repeats of gp
the human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  envelope env proteins that mediate membrane fusion represent a major target for the development of new aids therapies three classes of env mediated membrane fusion inhibitors have been described that specifically target the pre hairpin intermediate conformation of gp  class  inhibitors bind to the c terminal heptad repeat c hr of gp  the single example of a class  inhibitor targets the trimeric n terminal heptad repeat n hr of gp  and has been postulated to sequestrate the n hr of the pre hairpin intermediate through the formation of fusion incompetent heterotrimers here we show that nccg gp  a class  inhibitor and n mut e g  a class  inhibitor synergistically inhibit env mediated membrane fusion for several representative hiv  strains x and r  in both a cell fusion assay with membrane bound cd  and an env pseudo typed virus neutralization assay the mechanistic as well as potential therapeutic implications of these observations for hiv env mediated membrane fusion are discussed
