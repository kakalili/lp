differential interaction of hiv  integrase and jpo with the c terminus of ledgf p
the transcriptional co activator lens epithelium derived growth factor ledgf has been shown to protect cells against environmental stress the protein has been implicated in auto immunity and cancer and is present in cells as the p  or p  splice variant recently ledgf p  but not p  was identified as the prominent interaction partner of human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  integrase this interaction of hiv  integrase with the c terminal integrase binding domain of ledgf p  is crucial for hiv  replication to gain insight into the cell biology of ledgf p  we were interested in identifying cellular binding partners of its c terminal domain by yeast two hybrid screening with a cemc cdna library we were able to identify jpo as a binding partner of the c terminal part of ledgf p  the specific interaction between jpo and ledgf p  was verified by pull down alphascreen and co immunoprecipitation competition assays using recombinant proteins show a mutually exclusive binding of either jpo or hiv  integrase to ledgf p  however differing mechanisms of binding were suggested by continuing interaction of jpo with some ledgf p  mutants i  a d  a f  a that are totally defective for interaction with hiv  integrase this finding is of significance for the development of specific inhibitors targeting only the interaction between ledgf p  and hiv  integrase without disturbing interaction with other cellular factors over expression of jpo resulted in a modest but reproducible inhibition of hiv  replication consistent with competition between integrase and jpo for binding to ledgf p  furthermore jpo over expression activated transcription from the hiv  ltr
