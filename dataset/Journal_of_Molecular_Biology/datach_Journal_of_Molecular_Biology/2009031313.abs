solution structure of s  a bound to the capz peptide trtk
as is typical for s   target protein interactions a ca  dependent conformational change in s  a is required to bind to a  residue peptide trtk  derived from the actin capping protein capz in addition the ca  binding affinity of s  a is found to be tightened greater than threefold when trtk  is bound to examine the biophysical basis for these observations we determined the solution nmr structure of trtk  in a complex with ca  loaded s  a  when bound to s  a  trtk  forms an amphipathic helix residues n to s  with several favorable hydrophobic interactions observed between w  i  and l  of the peptide and a well defined hydrophobic binding pocket in s  a that is only present in the ca  bound state next the structure of s  a  trtk  was compared to that of another s  a  target complex i e  s  a  ryrp   which illustrated how the binding pocket in ca  s  a can accommodate peptide targets with varying amino acid sequences similarities and differences were observed when the structures of s  a  trtk  and s  b  trtk  were compared providing insights regarding how more than one s  protein can interact with the same peptide target such comparisons including those with other s   target and s   drug complexes provide the basis for designing novel small molecule inhibitors that could be specific for blocking one or more s   target protein interactions
