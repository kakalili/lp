a comprehensive view on proteasomal sequences implications for the evolution of the proteasome
proteasomes are large multimeric self compartmentizing proteases which play a crucial role in the clearance of misfolded proteins breakdown of regulatory proteins processing of proteins by specific partial proteolysis cell cycle control as well as preparation of peptides for immune presentation two main types can be distinguished by their different tertiary structure the  s proteasome and the proteasome like heat shock protein encoded by heat shock locus v hslv usually each biological kingdom is characterized by its specific type of proteasome the  s proteasomes occur in eukarya and archaea whereas hslv protease is prevalent in bacteria to verify this rule we applied a genome wide sequence search to identify proteasomal sequences in data of finished and yet unfinished genome projects we found several exceptions to this paradigm   protista in addition to the  s proteasome leishmania trypanosoma and plasmodium contained hslv which may have been acquired from an  proteobacterial progenitor of mitochondria   bacteria for magnetospirillum magnetotacticum and enterococcus faecium we found that each contained two distinct hslvs due to gene duplication or horizontal transfer including unassembled data into the analyses we confirmed that a number of bacterial genomes do not contain any proteasomal sequence due to gene loss   high g c gram positives we confirmed that high g c gram positives possess  s proteasomes rather than hslv proteases the core of the  s proteasome consists of two distinct main types of homologous monomers   and   which differentiated into seven subtypes by further gene duplications by looking at the genome of the intracellular pathogen encephalitozoon cuniculi we were able to show that differentiation of  type subunits into different subtypes occurred earlier than that of  subunits additionally our search strategy had an important methodological consequence a comprehensive sequence search for a particular protein should also include the raw sequence data when possible because proteins might be missed in the completed assembled genome the structure based multiple proteasomal alignment of   sequences from   organisms can be downloaded from the url   http  www charite de bioinf people christophgille and will be updated regularly
