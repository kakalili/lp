chromatin structure and replication origins determinants of chromosome replication and nuclear organization
the dna replication program is in part determined by the epigenetic landscape that governs local chromosome architecture and directs chromosome duplication replication must coordinate with other biochemical processes occurring concomitantly on chromatin such as transcription and remodeling to insure accurate duplication of both genetic and epigenetic features and to preserve genomic stability the importance of genome architecture and chromatin looping in coordinating cellular processes on chromatin is illustrated by two recent sets of discoveries first chromatin associated proteins that are not part of the core replication machinery were shown to affect the timing of dna replication these chromatin associated proteins could be working in concert or perhaps in competition with the transcriptional machinery and with chromatin modifiers to determine the spatial and temporal organization of replication initiation events second epigenetic interactions are mediated by dna sequences that determine chromosomal replication in this review we summarize recent findings and current models linking spatial and temporal regulation of the replication program with epigenetic signaling we discuss these issues in the context of the genome s three dimensional structure with an emphasis on events occurring during the initiation of dna replication
