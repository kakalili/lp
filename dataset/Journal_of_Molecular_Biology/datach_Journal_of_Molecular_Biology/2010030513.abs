structure dynamics and rna interaction analysis of the human sbds protein
shwachman  bodian  diamond syndrome is an autosomal recessive genetic syndrome with pleiotropic phenotypes including pancreatic deficiencies bone marrow dysfunctions with increased risk of myelodysplasia or leukemia and skeletal abnormalities this syndrome has been associated with mutations in the sbds gene which encodes a conserved protein showing orthologs in archaea and eukaryotes the shwachman  bodian  diamond syndrome pleiotropic phenotypes may be an indication of different cell type requirements for a fully functional sbds protein rna binding activity has been predicted for archaeal and yeast sbds orthologs with the latter also being implicated in ribosome biogenesis however full length sbds orthologs function in a species specific manner indicating that the knowledge obtained from model systems may be of limited use in understanding major unresolved issues regarding sbds function namely the effect of mutations in human sbds on its biochemical function and the specificity of rna interaction we determined the solution structure and backbone dynamics of the human sbds protein and describe its rna binding site using nmr spectroscopy similarly to the crystal structures of archaea the overall structure of human sbds comprises three well folded domains however significant conformational exchange was observed in nmr dynamics experiments for the flexible linker between the n terminal domain and the central domain and these experiments also reflect the relative motions of the domains rna titrations monitored by heteronuclear correlation experiments and chemical shift mapping analysis identified a classic rna binding site at the n terminal fysh fungal yhr  wp shwachman domain that concentrates most of the mutations described for the human sbds
