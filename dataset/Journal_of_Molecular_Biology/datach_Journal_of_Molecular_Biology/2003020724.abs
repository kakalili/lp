complete nucleotide sequence of carbazole dioxin degrading plasmid pcar in pseudomonas resinovorans strain ca  indicates its mosaicity and the presence of large catabolic transposon tn
the car and ant operons originally isolated from pseudomonas resinovorans strain ca  contain the genes encoding the carbazole dioxin degrading enzymes and anthranilate   dioxygenase respectively and are located on the plasmid pcar  the entire nucleotide sequence of pcar was determined to elucidate the mechanism by which the car operon may have been assembled and distributed in nature pcar is a     bp circular plasmid and carries   open reading frames although the incompatibility group of pcar is unclear its potential origin for replication orip and rep and par proteins appeared to be closely related to those of plasmid pl  isolated from pseudomonas fluorescens the potential tellurite resistance klaabc genes identified in the neighboring region of repa gene were also related to those in incp plasmid originally identified from pseudomonads on the other hand we found genes encoding proteins that showed low but significant homology      identity with trh and tra proteins from enterobacteriaceae which are potentially involved in conjugative transfer of plasmids or genomic island suggesting that pcar is also a conjugative plasmid in pcar  we found tnpaccst genes that encoded the proteins showing gt   length wise identities with those are encoded by the toluene xylene degrading transposon tn   of tol plasmid pww  both car and ant degradative operons were found within a   kb tn   sequence defined by flanking tnpacc and tnpst genes and bordered by a  bp inverted repeat ir  within tn   and its flanking region we found the remnants of numerous mobile genetic elements such as the duplicated transposase genes that are highly homologous to tnpr of tn   and the multiple candidates of irs for tn   and tn   like element we also found distinct regions with high and low g c contents within tn   which contain an ant operon and car operon respectively these results suggested that multiple step assembly could have taken place before the current structure of tn   had been captured
