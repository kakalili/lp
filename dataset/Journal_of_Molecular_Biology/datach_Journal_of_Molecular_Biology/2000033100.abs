low temperature regulated dead box rna helicase from the antarctic archaeon methanococcoides burtonii edited by j h miller
dead box rna helicases by unwinding duplex rna in bacteria and eukaryotes are involved in essential cellular processes including translation initiation and ribosome biogenesis and have recently been implicated in enabling bacteria to survive cold shock and grow at low temperature despite these critical physiological roles they have not been characterized in archaea due to their presumed importance in removing cold stabilised secondary structures in mrna we have characterised a putative dead box rna helicase gene dead from the antarctic methanogen methanococcoides burtonii the encoded protein dead is predicted to contain a core element involved in atp hydrolysis and rna binding and an unusual c terminal domain that contains seven perfect trideca peptide direct repeats that may be involved in rna binding alignment and phylogenetic analyses were performed on the core regions of the m burtonii and other dead box rna helicases these revealed a loose but consistent clustering of archaeal and bacterial sequences and enabled the generation of a prokaryotic specific consensus sequence the consensus highlights the importance of residues other than the eight motifs that are often associated with dead box rna helicases as well as de emphasising the importance of the  a  residue within the  dead  motif cells growing at  c contained abundant levels of dead mrna however no mrna was detected in cells growing at   c the optimal temperature for growth  the transcription initiation site was mapped downstream from an archaeal box a element tata box  which preceded a long   nucleotides    untranslated region    utr  within the   utr was an  bp sequence that closely matches nine out of   cold box elements that are present in the   utrs of cold shock induced genes from bacteria to determine if the archaeal   utr performs an analagous function to the bacterial   utrs the archaeal dead   utr was transcribed in e coli under the control of the cspa promoter and transcriptional terminator it has previously been reported that overexpression of the cspa   utr leads to an extended cold shock response due to the   utr titrating cellular levels of a cold shock repressor protein s  in our hands the cold shock protein profiles resulting from overexpression of escherichia coli cspa and m burtonii dead   utrs were similar however they did not differ from those for the overexpression of a control plasmid lacking a   utr in association with other recent data from e coli our results indicate that the role of the   utr in gene regulation is presently unclear irrespective of the mechanisms it is striking that highly similar   utrs with cold box elements are present in cold induced genes from e coli anabaena and m burtonii this is the first study examining low temperature regulation in archaea and provides initial evidence that gene expression from a cold adapted archaeon involves a bacterial like transcriptional regulatory mechanism in addition it provides the foundation for further studies into the function and regulation of dead box rna helicases in archaea and in particular their roles in low temperature adaptation
