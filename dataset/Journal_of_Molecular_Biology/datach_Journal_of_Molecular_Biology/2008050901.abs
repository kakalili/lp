multifunctional roles of a bacteriophage   morphogenetic factor in assembly and infection
low copy number proteins within macromolecular complexes such as viruses can be critical to biological function while comprising a minimal mass fraction of the complex the bacillus subtilis double stranded dna bacteriophage   gene  product gp   previously undetected in the virion was identified and localized to the distal tip of the tail knob western blots and immuno electron microscopy detected a few copies of gp  in    dna free particles purified tails and defective particles produced in suppressor sensitive sus mutant sus    infections particles assembled in the absence of intact gp  sus    and sus     had the gross morphology of   but were not infectious gp  has predicted structural homology and sequence similarity to the m  metalloprotease lytm poised at the tip of the   tail knob gp  may serve as a plug to help restrain the highly pressurized packaged genome also in this position gp  may be the first virion protein to contact the cell wall in infection acting as a pilot protein to depolymerize the cell wall gp  may facilitate juxtaposition of the tail knob onto the cytoplasmic membrane and the triggering of genome injection
