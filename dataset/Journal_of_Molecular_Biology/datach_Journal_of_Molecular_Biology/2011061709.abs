probing dimerization and structural flexibility of mammalian lipoxygenases by small angle x ray scattering
human lipoxygenases loxs and their metabolites have a great impact on human homeostasis and are of interest for targeted drug design this goal requires detailed knowledge of their structures and an understanding of structure  function relationship at the moment there are two complete crystal structures for mammalian lox rabbit   lox r   lox and human lox h lox  and a fragment of human  lox the low resolution structures in solution for various lox isoforms have brought about controversial results here we explored the behavior of r   lox in aqueous solution under different conditions salt and ph by small angle x ray scattering saxs and compared it with human platelet type  s lox hp  lox and h lox thermodynamic calculations concerning the stability of molecular assemblies thermal motion analysis tlsmd translation libration and screw rotation motion detection based on crystallographic temperature factor bj  and results of saxs analyses brought about the following conclusions  i in contrast to its crystal structure r   lox functions as a monomer that dominates in solution  ii it dimerizes at higher protein concentrations in the presence of salt and with increasing degree of motional freedom of the n terminal plat domain as suggested by the y     r double mutant  iii in aqueous solutions hp  lox is stable as a dimer in contrast to h lox and r   lox which are monomeric and iv all three mammalian isozymes show a high level of flexibility not only for the plat domain but also for other subdomains of the catalytic part in tls translation libration and screw rotation analysis and hp  lox in saxs
