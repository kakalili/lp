structure and energetics of encapsidated dna in bacteriophage hk  studied by scanning calorimetry and cryo electron microscopy
encapsidation of duplex dna by bacteriophages represents an extreme case of genome condensation reaching near crystalline concentrations of dna the hk  system is well suited to study this phenomenon in view of the detailed knowledge of its capsid structure to characterize the interactions involved we combined calorimetry with cryo electron microscopy and native gel electrophoresis we found that as in other phages hk  dna is organized in coaxially wound nested shells when dna filled capsids heads are scanned in buffer containing  mm mg  dna melting and capsid denaturation both contribute to the complex thermal profile between    c and    c in other conditions absence of mg  and lower ionic strength  dna melting shifts to lower temperatures and the two events are resolved heads release their dna at temperatures well below the onset of dna melting or capsid denaturation we suggest that on heating the internal pressure increases causing the dna to exit  probably via the portal vertex  while the capsid although largely intact sustains local damage that leads to an earlier onset of thermal denaturation heads differ structurally from empty capsids in the curvature of their protein shell a change attributable to outwards pressure exerted by the dna we propose that this transition is sensed by the portal that is embedded in the capsid wall whereupon the structure of the portal and its interactions with terminase the packaging enzyme are altered thus signaling that packaging is at or approaching completion
