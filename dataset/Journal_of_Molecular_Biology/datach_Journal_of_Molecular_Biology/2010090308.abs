interaction of the hsp  molecular chaperones from s cerevisiae with substrate protein
hsp  proteins act as nucleotide exchange factors of the molecular chaperone hsp  in eukaryotes in addition they have been reported to stabilize unfolded proteins for subsequent refolding hsp  proteins belong to the hsp  superfamily and in analogy to hsp  the substrate binding site was proposed to be located at the interface of the  sandwich domain and the three helix bundle domain saccharomyces cerevisiae has two closely related cytosolic isoforms of hsp   sse p and sse p under normal growth conditions sse p is the predominant form sse p is induced under stress conditions such as heat shock consistent with these findings we find that sse p has increased temperature stability both sse p and sse p accelerate nucleotide exchange on the yeast hsp  ssa p furthermore sse p and sse p effectively compete for binding of unfolded luciferase in contrast to sse p however sse p fails to stabilize this model substrate under thermal stress for subsequent hsp  mediated refolding using a domain shuffling approach we show that both the nucleotide binding domain and the  sandwich domain of sse p are required to preserve nonnative luciferase in a folding competent state our findings suggest that sse p must undergo partial unfolding for efficient protection of luciferase and that the  sandwich domain of sse p acts as an intramolecular chaperone for refolding of the nucleotide binding domain under extreme stress conditions sse p appears to take over the nucleotide exchange factor function of sse p and might promote the controlled aggregation of stress denatured proteins
