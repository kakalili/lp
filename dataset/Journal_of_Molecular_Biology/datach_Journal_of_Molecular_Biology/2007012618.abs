tandem dimerization of the human p  tetramerization domain stabilizes a primary dimer intermediate and dramatically enhances its oligomeric stability
tetramerization of the human p  tumor suppressor protein is required for its biological functions however cellular levels of p  indicate that it exists predominantly in a monomeric state since the oligomerization of p  involves the rate limiting formation of a primary dimer intermediate we engineered a covalently linked pair of human p  tetramerization p tet domains to generate a tandem dimer p tettd that minimizes the energetic requirements for forming the primary dimer we demonstrate that p tettd self assembles into an oligomeric structure equivalent to the wild type p tet tetramer and exhibits dramatically enhanced oligomeric stability specifically the p tettd dimer exhibits an unfolding dissociation equilibrium constant of   fm at    c or a million fold increase in stability relative to the wild type p tet tetramer and resists subunit exchange with monomeric p tet in addition whereas the wild type p tet tetramer undergoes coupled i e two state dissociation unfolding to unfolded monomers the p tettd dimer denatures via an intermediate that is detectable by differential scanning calorimetry but not cd spectroscopy consistent with a folded p tettd monomer that is equivalent to the p tet primary dimer given its oligomeric stability and resistance against hetero oligomerization dimerization of p  constructs incorporating the tetramerization domain may yield functional constructs that may resist exchange with wild type or mutant forms of p
