r subunit isoform specificity in protein kinase a distinct features of protein interfaces in pka types i and ii by amide h h exchange mass spectrometry
the two isoforms ri and rii of the regulatory r subunit of camp dependent protein kinase or protein kinase a pka are similar in sequence yet have different biochemical properties and physiological functions to further understand the molecular basis for r isoform specificity the interactions of the rii  isoform with the pka catalytic c subunit were analyzed by amide h h exchange mass spectrometry to compare solvent accessibility of rii  and the c subunit in their free and complexed states direct mapping of the rii  c interface revealed important differences between the intersubunit interfaces in the type i and type ii holoenzyme complexes these differences are seen in both the r subunits as well as the c subunit unlike the type i isoform the type ii isoform complexes require both camp binding domains and atp is not obligatory for high affinity interactions with the c subunit surprisingly the c subunit mediates distinct overlapping surfaces of interaction with the two r isoforms despite a strong homology in sequence and similarity in domain organization identification of a remote allosteric site on the c subunit that is essential for interactions with rii but not ri subunits further highlights the considerable diversity in interfaces found in higher order protein complexes mediated by the c subunit of pka
