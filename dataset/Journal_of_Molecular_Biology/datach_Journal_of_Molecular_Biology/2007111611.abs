the trimeric periplasmic chaperone skp of escherichia coli forms   complexes with outer membrane proteins via hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions
the interactions of outer membrane proteins omps with the periplasmic chaperone skp from escherichia coli are not well understood we have examined the binding of skp to various omps of different origin size and function these were ompa ompg and yaet omp  from escherichia coli the translocator domain of the autotransporter nalp from neisseria meningitides foma from fusobacterium nucleatum and the voltage dependent anion selective channel human isoform  hvdac  from mitochondria binding of skp was observed for bacterial omps but neither for hvdac nor for soluble bovine serum albumin the skp trimer formed   complexes omp skp  with bacterial omps independent of their size or origin the dissociation constants of these omp skp complexes were all in the nanomolar range indicating that they are stable complexes of skp with yaet displayed the smallest dissociation constants complexes with nalp the largest omp binding to skp was ph dependent and not observed when either skp or omps were neutralized at very basic or very acidic ph when the ionic strength was increased the free energies of binding of skp to ompa or ompg were reduced electrostatic interactions were therefore necessary for formation and stability of omp skp complexes light scattering and circular dichroism experiments demonstrated that skp remained a stable trimer from ph  to ph   in the ompa skp complex skp efficiently shielded tryptophan residues of the transmembrane strands of ompa against fluorescence quenching by aqueous acrylamide lipopolysaccharide lps  a major component of the outer membrane of gram negative bacteria bound to ompa skp complexes at low stoichiometries acrylamide quenching of fluorescence indicated that in this ternary complex the tryptophan residues of the transmembrane domain of ompa were located closer to the surface than in binary ompa skp complexes this may explain previous observations that folding of skp bound ompa into lipid bilayers is facilitated in presence of lps
