structural analysis of chi chitinase from yen tc the multisubunit insecticidal abc toxin complex of yersinia entomophaga
yersinia entomophaga mh  is a native new zealand soil bacterium that secretes a large abc type protein toxin complex yen tc similar to those produced by nematode associated bacteria such as photorhabdus luminescens y entomophaga displays an exceptionally virulent pathogenic phenotype in sensitive insect species causing death within   h of infection because of this phenotype there is intrinsic interest in the mechanism of action of yen tc and it also has the potential to function as a novel class of biopesticide we have identified genes that encode chitinases as part of the toxin complex loci in y entomophaga mh  p luminescens photorhabdus asymbiotica and xenorhabdus nematophila furthermore we have shown that the secreted toxin complex from y entomophaga mh  includes two chitinases as an integral part of the complex a feature not described previously in other abc toxins and possibly related to the severe disease caused by this bacterium we present here the structure of the y entomophaga mh  chi chitinase determined by x ray crystallography to     resolution and show that a ring of five symmetrically arranged lobes on the surface of the yen tc toxin complex structure as determined by single particle electron microscopy provides a good fit to the chi monomer we also confirm that the isolated chitinases display endochitinase activity as does the complete toxin complex
