The structure of a complex between a bivalent diabody and its antigen, influenza neuraminidase, has been determined by electron cryomicroscopy of single particles and image analysis. A three-dimensional reconstruction has been interpreted in terms of high-resolution X-ray models of the component proteins. The complex consists of two neuraminidase tetramers cross-linked by four diabodies with 422 point symmetry. The structure and symmetry of the complex is determined uniquely by packing constraints consistent with the maximum possible number of diabody cross-links. Diabodies may provide a useful approach to the structure determination of small proteins by incorporating the proteins into large symmetric complexes followed by single-particle electron microscopy.
