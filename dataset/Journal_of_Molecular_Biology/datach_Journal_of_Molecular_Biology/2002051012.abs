three dimensional structure of human tubulin chaperone cofactor a
and  tubulin fold in a series of chaperone assisted steps at least five protein cofactors are involved in the post chaperonin tubulin folding pathway and required to maintain the supply of tubulin some of them also participate in microtubule dynamics the first tubulin chaperone identified in the tubulin folding pathway was cofactor a coa  here we describe the three dimensional structure of human coa at    resolution determined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction mad  the structure is a monomer with a rod like shape and consists of a three  helix bundle or coiled coil with the second helix kinked by a proline break offering a convex surface at one face of the protein the helices are connected by short turns one of them between   and   including a   helix peptide mapping analysis and competition experiments with peptides show that coa interacts with  tubulin via the three  helical regions but not with the rod end loops the main interaction occurs with the middle kinked   helix at the convex face of the rod strong d structural homology is found with the hsp  chaperone cofactor bag domain suggesting that these proteins define a family of cofactors of simple compact architecture further structural homology is found with  spectrin  actinin repeats all are rods of identical length of ten helical turns we propose to call these three helix bundles alpha ten modules
