thioaptamer interactions with prion proteins sequence specific and non specific binding sites
binding of nucleic acids to the prion protein prp created a conundrum that required distinguishing between non specific interactions and biologically important polynucleotides in the process of developing selective ligands for prp we found using a single stranded dna thioaptamer library that the binding of thioaptamers to prp occurs on at least two different sites on the protein selection against recombinant rec prp of syrian hamster sha sequence     folded into an  helical rich conformation identified a  base consensus sequence within a series of  thioaptamers all of which consist of  bases each thioaptamer was comprised of both normal and thio da modified bases one thioaptamer designated  bound to recshaprp with affinity of       nm lower affinities for bovine bo  and human hu were found establishing that binding is dependent on the primary structure of prp high affinity binding of thioaptamer  to prp was found to be mediated through the dodecyl sequence gacacaagccga within the consensus region with five critical backbone modifications   to each da residue a control oligonucleotide with an equivalent number of phosphorothioates to thioaptamer  and a scrambled consensus sequence could not distinguish among the three prp sequences control oligonucleotides bearing non selected sequences bound to prp at a sequence independent dna binding site in contrast the high affinity binding of thioaptamer  to prp depends on   backbone modifications   oligonucleotide sequence and   prp sequence
