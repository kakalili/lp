reversible photo regulation of a hammerhead ribozyme using a diffusible effector
the potential utility of catalytic rnas and dnas ribozymes and deoxyribozymes respectively as reagents in molecular biology as well as therapeutic agents for a variety of human diseases has long been recognized although naturally occurring rna cleaving ribozymes are typically not subject to feedback control rational methodologies for the creation of allosteric ribozymes by functional combination of ribozyme and ligand responsive aptamer rna elements have existed for some years here we report the in vitro selection of rna aptamers specific for binding one but not the other of two light induced isomers of a dihydropyrene photo switch compound and the utilization of such an aptamer for the construction of the ug dihydropyrene ribozyme an allosteric hammerhead ribozyme whose catalysis is controllable by irradiation with visible versus ultraviolet light in the presence of micromolar concentrations of the photo switch compound the ribozyme behaves as a two state switch exhibiting a gt   fold difference in catalytic rates between the two irradiation regimes we anticipate that the ug dihydropyrene and other ribozymes like it may find significant application in the developmental biology of model organisms such as drosophila melanogaster and caenorhabditis elegans as well as in the biomedical sciences
