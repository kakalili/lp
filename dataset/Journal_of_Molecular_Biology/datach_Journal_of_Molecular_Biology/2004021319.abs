the clamp loader  helicase interaction in bacillus atomic force microscopy reveals the structural organisation of the dnab   complex in bacillus
the clamp loader  helicase interaction is an important feature of the replisome although significant biochemical and structural work has been carried out on the clamp loader  clamp  dna polymerase  interactions in escherichia coli the clamp loader  helicase interaction is poorly understood by comparison the  subunit of the clamp loader mediates the interaction with dnab we have recently characterised this interaction in the bacillus system and established a    dnab stoichiometry here we have obtained atomic force microscopy images of the   dnab complex that reveal the first structural insight into its architecture we show that despite the reported absence of the shorter  version in bacillus   has a domain organisation similar to its e coli counterpart and possesses an equivalent c terminal domain that interacts with dnab the interaction interface of dnab is also localised in its c terminal domain the combined data contribute towards our understanding of the bacterial replisome
