structure of a c rich strand fragment of the human centromeric satellite iii a ph dependent intercalation topology edited by k nagai
repetitive dna sequences may adopt unusual pairing arrangements at acid to neutral ph cytidine rich dna oligodeoxynucleotides can form the i motif structure in which two parallel stranded duplexes with c c pairs are intercalated head to tail the i motif may be formed by multimeric associations or by intra molecular folding depending on the number of cytidine tracts the nucleotide sequences between them and the experimental conditions we have found that a natural fragment of the human centromeric satellite iii d ccattccattcctttcc  can form two monomeric i motif structures that differ in their intercalation topology and that are favored at ph values higher the  form and lower the  form than   the change in intercalation may be related to adenine protonation in the loops we studied the uridine derivative methylated on the first cytidine base d mccattccautccuttcc  whose proton spectrum is better resolved the intercalation topologies are c  c   mc  c   c  c   c  c  for form  and  mc  c   c  c   c  c   c  c  for form   we have solved the structure of the  form and we present a model for the  form the switch from  to  involves disruption of the i motif in both forms the central aut linker crosses the wide groove and the first and the third linkers loop across the minor grooves the i motif core is extended in the  form by the inter loop reverse watson crick a  u  pair whose dissociation constant is around    at   c and in the  form by the interloop t  t  pair in contrast d mccattccttacctttcc folds into a ph independent structure that has the same intercalation topology as the  form the i motif core is extended below by the interloop t  t  pair and closed on top by the t  a  pair thus the c rich strand of the human satellite iii tandem repeats like the g rich strand can fold into various compact structures the relevance of these features to centromeric function remains unknown
