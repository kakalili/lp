the orf  gene product from conjugative transposon tn  is an arda antirestriction protein that inhibits type i dna restriction  modification systems
gene orf  which is situated within the intercellular transposition region of the conjugative transposon tn  from the bacterial pathogen enterococcus faecalis encodes a putative arda alleviation of restriction of dna a protein conjugative transposons are generally resistant to dna restriction upon transfer to a new host arda from tn  may be responsible for the apparent immunity of the transposon to dna restriction and modification r m systems and for ensuring that the transposon has a broad host range the orf  gene was engineered for overexpression in escherichia coli and the recombinant arda protein was purified to homogeneity the protein appears to exist as a dimer at nanomolar concentrations but can form larger assemblies at micromolar concentrations r m assays revealed that arda can efficiently inhibit r m by all four major classes of type i r m enzymes both in vivo and in vitro these r m systems are present in over   of sequenced prokaryotic genomes our results suggest that arda can overcome the restriction barrier following conjugation and so helps increase the spread of antibiotic resistance genes by horizontal gene transfer
