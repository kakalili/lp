crystal structures of mammalian glutamine synthetases illustrate substrate induced conformational changes and provide opportunities for drug and herbicide design
glutamine synthetase gs catalyzes the ligation of glutamate and ammonia to form glutamine with concomitant hydrolysis of atp in mammals the activity eliminates cytotoxic ammonia at the same time converting neurotoxic glutamate to harmless glutamine there are a number of links between changes in gs activity and neurodegenerative disorders such as alzheimer s disease in plants because of its importance in the assimilation and re assimilation of ammonia the enzyme is a target of some herbicides gs is also a central component of bacterial nitrogen metabolism and a potential drug target previous studies had investigated the structures of bacterial and plant gss in the present publication we report the first structures of mammalian gss the apo form of the canine enzyme was solved by molecular replacement and refined at a resolution of    two structures of human glutamine synthetase represent complexes with a phosphate adp and manganese and b a phosphorylated form of the inhibitor methionine sulfoximine adp and manganese these structures were refined to resolutions of     and     respectively loop movements near the active site generate more closed forms of the eukaryotic enzymes when substrates are bound the largest changes are associated with the binding of the nucleotide comparisons with earlier structures provide a basis for the design of drugs that are specifically directed at either human or bacterial enzymes the site of binding the amino acid substrate is highly conserved in bacterial and eukaryotic gss whereas the nucleotide binding site varies to a much larger degree thus the latter site offers the best target for specific drug design differences between mammalian and plant enzymes are much more subtle suggesting that herbicides targeting gs must be designed with caution
