molecular mechanism of inward rectifier potassium channel   regulation by tax interacting protein
inwardly rectifying potassium channel   kir   is specifically targeted on the basolateral membranes of epithelial and neuronal cells and it thus plays an important role in maintaining potassium homeostasis tax interacting protein  tip   an atypical pdz domain containing protein binds to kir  with a high affinity causing the intracellular accumulation of kir  in cultured epithelial cells however the molecular basis of the tip  kir  interaction is still poorly understood here we present the crystal structure of tip  in complex with the c terminal kir  peptide residues      to reveal the molecular details of the interaction between them moreover isothermal titration calorimetry experiments show that the c terminal kir  peptide binds much more strongly to tip  than to mammalian lin  indicating that tip  can compete with mammalian lin  to uncouple kir  from its basolateral membrane anchoring complex we further show that the phosphorylation dephosphorylation of ser  within the c terminal kir  pdz binding motif rresai dynamically regulates the kir  tip  association in heterologous hek  t cells these data suggest that tip  may act as an important regulator for the endocytic pathway of kir
