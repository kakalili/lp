SuperStar is an empirical method for identifying interaction sites in proteins, based entirely on the experimental information about non-bonded interactions, present in the IsoStar database. The interaction information in IsoStar is contained in scatterplots, which show the distribution of a chosen probe around structure fragments. SuperStar breaks a template molecule (e.g. a protein binding site) into structural fragments which correspond to those in the scatterplots. The scatterplots are then superimposed on the corresponding parts of the template and converted into a composite propensity map.The original version of SuperStar was based entirely on scatterplots from the CSD. Here, scatterplots based on protein-ligand interactions are implemented in SuperStar, and validated on a test set of 122 X-ray structures of protein-ligand complexes. In this validation, propensity maps are compared with the experimentally observed positions of ligand atoms of comparable types. Although non-bonded interaction geometries in small molecule structures are similar to those found in protein-ligand complexes, their relative frequencies of occurrence are different. Polar interactions are more common in the first class of structures, while interactions between hydrophobic groups are more common in protein crystals. In general, PDB and CSD-based SuperStar maps appear equally successful in the prediction of protein-ligand interactions. PDB-based maps are more suitable to identify hydrophobic pockets, and inherently take into account the experimental uncertainties of protein atomic positions. If the protonation state of a histidine, aspartate or glutamate protein side-chain is known, specific CSD-based maps for that protonation state are preferred over PDB-based maps which represent an ensemble of protonation states.
