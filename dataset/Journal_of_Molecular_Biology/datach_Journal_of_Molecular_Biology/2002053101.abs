a bipartite bacteriophage t soc and hoc randomized peptide display library detection and analysis of phage t terminase gp  and late  factor gp  interaction
hoc and soc are dispensable t capsid proteins that can be used for phage display of multiple copies of peptides and proteins a bipartite phage t peptide library was created by displaying on tetra alanine linker peptides five randomized amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of soc and five randomized amino acids from the amino terminus of hoc the bipartite library was biopanned against the phage t terminase large subunit gp  to identify t gene products that may interact with the terminase the sequences of selected phages displayed matches to those t gene products previously known by genetic and biochemical criteria to interact with gp  gp  portal protein  gp  single stranded dna binding protein  gp  terminase small subunit  and gp  self  in addition matches were found to gp  t late  factor  gp  sliding clamp  gp  clamp loader  gp  dna end protein  and gp  major capsid protein abundant amino acid sequence matches were found to aa region      of gp  immunoprecipitation and affinity column chromatography demonstrated direct binding of gp  and gp  moreover gp  bound specifically to a column coupled peptide corresponding to gp  residues      measurements of gene  and other mrna levels in mutant infected bacteria did not support a role of gp   gp  interaction in regulation of terminase or other late gene transcription however whereas dna concatemers that accumulate in prohead and terminase defective phage t infections could be packaged in vitro to    wild type efficiency  am am defective concatemeric dna was packaged at least   fold less efficiently moreover gp  residues      peptide specifically blocked dna packaging in vitro these results suggest that the t terminase interaction with t late  factor gp  plays a role in dna packaging in vivo the gp  interaction may function to load the terminase onto dna for packaging
