locating the thapsigargin binding site on ca  atpase by cryoelectron microscopy edited by w baumeister
thapsigargin tg is a potent inhibitor of ca  atpase from sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticula previous enzymatic studies have concluded that ca  atpase is locked in a dead end complex upon binding tg with an affinity of lt  nm and that this complex closely resembles the e enzymatic state we have studied the structural effects of tg binding by cryoelectron microscopy of tubular crystals which have previously been shown to comprise ca  atpase molecules in the e conformation in particular we have compared d reconstructions of ca  atpase in the absence and presence of either tg or its dansylated derivative the overall molecular shape of ca  atpase in the reconstructions is very similar demonstrating that the tg ca  atpase complex does indeed physically resemble the e conformation in contrast to massive domain movements that appear to be induced by ca  binding difference maps reveal a consistent difference on the lumenal side of the membrane which we conclude corresponds to the thapsigargin binding site modeling the atomic structure for ca  atpase into our density maps reveals that this binding site is composed of the loops between transmembrane segments m m and m m  indirect effects are proposed to explain the effects of the s stalk segment on thapsigargin affinity as well as thapsigargin induced changes in atp affinity indeed a second difference density was observed at the decavanadate binding site within the three cytoplasmic domains which we believe reflects an altered affinity as a result of the long range conformational coupling that drives the reaction cycle of this family of atp dependent ion pumps
