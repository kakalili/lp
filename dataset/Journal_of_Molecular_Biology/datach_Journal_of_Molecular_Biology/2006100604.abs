the energetic network of hotspot residues between cdc b phosphatase and its protein substrate
we have investigated the functional network of hotspot residues at the remote docking site of two cell cycle regulators namely cdc b phosphatase and its native protein substrate cdk ptpy cyca specifically we have studied the roles of energetically important residues arg   arg   tyr  on cdc b and asp  and asp  on cdk ptpy cyca by generating a diverse set of substitutions and performing double and triple mutant cycle analyses this transient protein  protein interaction is particularly well suited for this mutagenic approach because various control experiments ensure that the effect of each mutation is limited to the interaction of interest we find binary coupling energies for ion pairs and hydrogen bonds ranging from   kcal mol to   kcal mol and ternary coupling energies of   kcal mol and   kcal mol overall our biochemical analyses are in good agreement with the docked structure of the complex and suggest the following roles for the individual hotspot residues on cdc b the most important contributor arg   forms a specific and tight bidentate interaction with asp  and a weaker interaction with asp  that cannot be replaced by a lys although tyr  does not directly participate in this ionic network it is important for buttressing arg  using both its hydrophobic aromatic ring and hydrophilic characteristics hydrogen bonding  arg  participates less specifically in the electrostatic network with asp  and asp  of the protein substrate as it can partially be replaced by lys our data provide insight how a cluster of residues in a docking site remote from the site of the chemical reaction can bring about efficient and specific substrate recognition
