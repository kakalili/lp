identification of novel contributions to high affinity glycoprotein  receptor interactions using engineered ligands
engineered receptor fragments and glycoprotein ligands employed in different assay formats have been used to dissect the basis for the dramatic enhancement of binding of two model membrane receptors dendritic cell specific intercellular adhesion molecule  grabbing nonintegrin dc sign and the macrophage galactose lectin to glycoprotein ligands compared to simple sugars these approaches make it possible to quantify the importance of two major factors that combine to enhance the affinity of single carbohydrate recognition domains crds for glycoprotein ligands by   to   fold first the presence of extended binding sites within a single crd can enhance interaction with branched glycans resulting in increases of fivefold to  fold in affinity second presentation of glycans on a glycoprotein surface increases affinity by  to  fold possibly due to low specificity interactions with the surface of the protein or restriction in the conformation of the glycans in contrast when solution phase networking is avoided enhancement due to binding of multiple branches of a glycan to multiple crds in the oligomeric forms of these receptors is minimal and binding of a receptor oligomer to multiple glycans on a single glycoprotein makes only a twofold contribution to overall affinity thus in these cases multivalent interactions of individual glycoproteins with individual receptor oligomers have a limited role in achieving high affinity these findings combined with considerations of membrane receptor geometry are consistent with the idea that further enhancement of the binding to multivalent glycoprotein ligands requires interaction of multiple receptor oligomers with the ligands
