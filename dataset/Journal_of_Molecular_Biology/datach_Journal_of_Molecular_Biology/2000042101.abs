high resolution crystal structure of s cerevisiae ypt   c  gppnhp a small gtp binding protein involved in regulation of endocytosis edited by r huber
ypt rab proteins are membrane associated small gtp binding proteins which play a central role in the coordination activation and regulation of vesicle mediated transport in eukaryotic cells we present the    high resolution crystal structure of ypt  in its active gppnhp bound conformation ypt  is an important regulator involved in the endocytic membrane traffic of saccharomyces cerevisiae the structure reveals small but significant structural differences compared with h ras p  the effector loop and the catalytic loop are well defined and stabilized by extensive hydrophobic interactions the switch i and switch ii regions form a well defined epitope for hypothetical effector protein binding sequence comparisons between the different isoforms ypt  ypt  and ypt  provide the first insights into determinants for specific effector binding and for fine tuning of the intrinsic gtp hydrolysis rate
