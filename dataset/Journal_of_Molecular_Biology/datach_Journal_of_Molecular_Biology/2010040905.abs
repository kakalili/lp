shape and flexibility in the titin  domain super repeat
titin is a giant protein of striated muscle with important roles in the assembly intracellular signalling and passive mechanical properties of sarcomeres the molecule consists principally of    immunoglobulin and fibronectin domains arranged in a chain more than   m long the isoform dependent n terminal part of the molecule forms an elastic connection between the end of the thick filament and the z line the larger constitutively expressed c terminal part is bound to the thick filament through most of the thick filament part the immunoglobulin and fibronectin domains are arranged in a repeating pattern of  domains termed the  large super repeat   there are  contiguous copies of the large super repeat making up a segment of the molecule nearly    m long we have studied a set of two domain and three domain recombinant fragments from the large super repeat region by electron microscopy synchrotron x ray solution scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation with the goal of reconstructing the overall structure of this part of titin the data illustrate different average conformations in different domain pairs which correlate with differences in interdomain linker lengths they also illustrate interdomain bending and flexibility around average conformations overall the data favour a helical conformation in the super repeat they also suggest that this region of titin is dimerised when bound to the thick filament
