action of the chaperonin groel es on a non native substrate observed with single molecule fret
the double ring shaped chaperonin groel binds a wide range of non native polypeptides within its central cavity and together with its cofactor groes assists their folding in an atp dependent manner the conformational cycle of groel es has been studied extensively but little is known about how the environment in the central cavity affects substrate conformation here we use the von hippel  lindau tumor suppressor protein vhl as a model substrate for studying the action of the groel es system on a bound polypeptide fluorescent labeling of pairs of sites on vhl for fluorescence f rster resonant energy transfer fret allows vhl to be used to explore how groel binding and groel es nucleotide binding affect the substrate conformation on average upon binding to groel all pairs of labeling sites experience compaction relative to the unfolded protein while single molecule fret distributions show significant heterogeneity upon addition of groes and atp to close the groel cavity on average further fret increases occur between the two hydrophobic regions of vhl accompanied by fret decreases between the n and c termini this suggests that atp and groes induced confinement within the groel cavity remodels bound polypeptides by causing expansion or racking of some regions and compaction of others most notably the hydrophobic core however single molecule observations of the specific fret changes for individual proteins at the moment of atp groes addition reveal that a large fraction of the population shows the opposite behavior that is fret decreases between the hydrophobic regions and fret increases for the n and c termini our time resolved single molecule analysis reveals the underlying heterogeneity of the action of groes el on a bound polypeptide substrate which might arise from the random nature of the specific binding to the various identical subunits of groel and might help explain why multiple rounds of binding and hydrolysis are required for some chaperonin substrates
