molecular architecture of the ankyrin socs box family of cul dependent e ubiquitin ligases
multi subunit cullin  ring e ligases often use repeat domain proteins as substrate specific adaptors structures of these macromolecular assemblies are determined for the f box containing leucine rich repeat and wd  repeat families but not for the suppressor of cytokine signaling socs box containing ankyrin repeat proteins asb     which assemble with elongins b and c and cul  we determined the crystal structures of the ternary complex of asb  elongin b c as well as the interacting n terminal domain of cul and used structural comparisons to establish a model for the complete cul based e ligase the structures reveal a distinct architecture of the asb complex that positions the ankyrin domain coaxial to the socs box  elongin b c complex and perpendicular to other repeat protein complexes this alternative architecture appears favorable to present the ankyrin domain substrate binding site to the e ubiquitin while also providing spacing suitable for bulky asb substrates such as the creatine kinases the presented cul structure also differs from previous models and deviates from other cullins via a rigid body rotation between cullin repeats this work highlights the adaptability of repeat domain proteins as scaffolds in substrate recognition and lays the foundation for future structure  function studies of this important e family
