The heat-shock protein ClpB is a protein-activated ATPase that is essential for survival of Escherichia coli at high temperatures. ClpB has also recently been suggested to function as a chaperone in reactivation of aggregated proteins. In addition, the clpB gene has been shown to contain two translational initiation sites and therefore encode two polypeptides of different size. To determine the structural organization of ClpB, the ClpB proteins were subjected to chemical cross-linking analysis and electron microscopy. The average images of the ClpB proteins with end-on orientation revealed a seven-membered, ring-shaped structure with a central cavity. Their side-on view showed a two-layered structure with an equal distribution of mass across the equatorial plane of the complex. Since the ClpB subunit has two large regions containing consensus sequences for nucleotide binding, each layer of the ClpB heptamer appears to represent the side projection of one of the major domains arranged on a ring. In the absence of salt and ATP, the ClpB proteins showed a high tendency to form a heptamer. However, they dissociated into various species of oligomers with smaller sizes, depending on salt concentration. Above 0.2 M NaCl, the ClpB proteins behaved most likely as a monomer in the absence of ATP, but assembled into a heptamer in its presence. Furthermore, mutations of the first ATP-binding site, but not the second site, prevented the ATP-dependent oligomerization of the ClpB proteins in the presence of 0.3 M NaCl. These results indicate that ClpB has a heptameric ring-shaped structure with a central cavity and this structural organization requires ATP binding to the first nucleotide-binding site localized to the N-terminal half of the ATPase.
