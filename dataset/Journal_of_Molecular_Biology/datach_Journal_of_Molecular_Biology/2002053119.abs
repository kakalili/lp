both temperature and medium composition regulate rnase e processing efficiency of the rpso mrna coding for ribosomal protein s  of escherichia coli
cleavage by rnase e is believed to be the rate limiting step in the degradation of many rnas these cleavages are modulated by   end phosphorylation folding and translation of the mrna in question here we present data suggesting that these cleavages are also regulated by environmental conditions we report that rpso mrna   minutes after a shift to   c is stabilized in cells grown in minimal medium this stabilization is correlated with a reduction in the efficiency of the rnase e cleavage which initiates its decay we also observe the appearance of rna fragments previously detected following rnase e inactivation and a defect in the adaptation of rnase e concentration these observations coupled to the fact that rnase e overproduction slightly reduces the accumulation of the rpso mrna suggest that this stabilization is caused in part by a limitation in rnase e concentration an increase in the steady state level of rpst mrna is also observed following a shift to   c in minimal medium however processing of the s rrna precursor is not affected under these conditions we thus propose that rnase e concentration changes in the cell in response to environmental conditions and that these changes can selectively affect the processing and the stability of individual mrnas our data also indicate that the efficiency of cleavage of the rpso mrna by rnase e is modified by other factor s which remain to be identified
