post translational regulation of cd  by atase atase mediated lysine acetylation
the cd  cell surface protein expresses the ac  epitope that is associated with cancer progenitor cells and cancer resistance to traditional anticancer therapies we report that the endoplasmic reticulum golgi intermediate compartment residing acetyltransferases atase  nat b and atase  nat  can physically interact with cd  to acetylate the protein on three lysine residues predicted to reside on the first extracellular loop of cd   site directed mutagenesis of these residues mimicking a loss of acetylation and downregulation or inhibition of atase atase resulted in near complete abolishment of cd  protein expression we also demonstrate that targeting atase atase results in apoptosis of cd  expressing acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells taken together we suggest that lysine acetylation on predicted extracellular residues plays a key role in expression and trafficking of cd  protein to the cell surface and can be targeted to disrupt cd  regulation and function
