acidic ph induced membrane insertion of colicin a into e coli natural lipids probed by site directed spin labeling
colicin a is a pore forming toxin that forms a voltage gated channel in the inner membrane of the target bacteria the structures of the closed and open channel states of membrane bound colicin a are not resolved in the present site directed spin labeling study the insertion competent state of colicin a is provoked by an acidic ph jump prior to the insertion into liposomes prepared from escherichia coli natural lipids the membrane bound colicin a is able to open a voltage dependent channel as demonstrated by the efflux of tempophosphate spin label from the lumen of liposomes the epr spectra of spin labeled colicin a variants in the membrane bound closed channel state reveal a conformational equilibrium with resolved interhelical tertiary contacts the spin label accessibility and polarity profiles suggest the amphipathic helices h  h and h  to be located in the membrane close to the membrane  water interface and the hydrophobic hairpin h and h  to be immersed more deeply in the membrane
