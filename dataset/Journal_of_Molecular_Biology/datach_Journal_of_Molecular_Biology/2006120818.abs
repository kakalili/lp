crystal structure of a multi domain immunophilin from arabidopsis thaliana a paradigm for regulation of plant abc transporters
fkbp  is a membrane anchored immunophilin playing a critical role in morphogenesis and development of higher plants we present the x ray structure of the cytoplasmic portion of fkbp  comprising both the fkbp like domain and the tpr domain at     resolution the data shed light on the probable binding modes of key interaction partners including hsp  and two classes of abc transporters the resulting models provide a structural background for further investigation of the unique biological properties of this protein
