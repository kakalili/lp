molecular mechanisms modulating glutamate kinase activity identification of the proline feedback inhibitor binding site
proline the feedback inhibitor of bacterial glutamate kinase gk and plant pyrroline  carboxylate synthase p cs enzymes is a key regulator of the osmotic and redox balance of cells using kinetic assays site directed mutagenesis structure  activity analyses and docking calculations we have identified the binding site of this metabolite in three dimensional structures of escherichia coli and campylobacter jejuni gks the proline binding cavity partially overlaps with the glutamate substrate site and the interaction of both proline and glutamate with gk is modulated by a flexible   residue loop linking  sheet  and  helix e in the active center cavity this loop is also critical for regulation of plant and human p css furthermore our results indicate that the functional unit of the e coli enzyme is dimeric and contains an intermolecular hydrogen bond network that interconnects the active center cavities of the monomers and is important for substrate binding
