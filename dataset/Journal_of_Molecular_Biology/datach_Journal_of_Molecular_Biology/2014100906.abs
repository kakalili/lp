the gene silencing transcription factor rest represses mir   expression in hippocampal neurons destined to die
the gene silencing transcription factor rest repressor element  silencing transcription factor nrsf neuron restrictive silencer factor actively represses a large array of coding and noncoding neuron specific genes important to synaptic plasticity including mir   mir   is a neuron specific microrna and plays a pivotal role in synaptogenesis synaptic plasticity and structural remodeling however a role for mir   in neuronal death is not as yet well delineated here we show that ischemic insults promote rest binding and epigenetic remodeling at the mir   promoter and silencing of mir   expression in selectively vulnerable hippocampal ca neurons rest occupancy was not altered at the mir  or mir  a promoters despite the presence of repressor element  sites indicating rest target specificity ischemia induced a substantial decrease in two marks of active gene transcription dimethylation of lysine  on core histone  h k me  and acetylation of lysine  on h  h k ac at the mir   promoter rnai mediated depletion of rest in vivo blocked ischemia induced loss of mir   in insulted hippocampal neurons consistent with a causal relation between activation of rest and silencing of mir   overexpression of mir   in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons or delivered directly into the ca of living rats by means of the lentiviral expression system prior to induction of ischemia afforded robust protection against ischemia induced neuronal death these findings document a previously unappreciated role for rest dependent repression of mir   in the neuronal death associated with global ischemia and identify a novel therapeutic target for amelioration of the neurodegeneration and cognitive deficits associated with ischemic stroke
