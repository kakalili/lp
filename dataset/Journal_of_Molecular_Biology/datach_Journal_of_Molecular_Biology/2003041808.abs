human dna polymerase  possesses terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase activity and can elongate rna primers implications for novel functions
dna polymerase  is a novel enzyme of the family x of dna polymerases the recent demonstration of an intrinsic   deoxyribose   phosphate lyase activity a template primer dependent polymerase activity a distributive manner of dna synthesis and sequence similarity to dna polymerase  suggested a novel  like enzyme all these properties support a role of dna polymerase  in base excision repair on the other hand the biochemical properties of the polymerisation activity of dna polymerase  are still largely unknown here we give evidence that human dna polymerase  has an intrinsic terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase activity that preferentially adds pyrimidines onto   oh ends of dna oligonucleotides furthermore human dna polymerase  efficiently elongates an rna primer hybridized to a dna template these two novel properties of human dna polymerase  might suggest additional roles for this enzyme in dna replication and repair processes
