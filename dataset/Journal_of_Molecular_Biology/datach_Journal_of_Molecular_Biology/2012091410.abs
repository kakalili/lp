role of n terminal myristylation in the structure and regulation of camp dependent protein kinase
the catalytic c subunit of camp dependent protein kinase protein kinase a pka  is a major target of camp signaling and its regulation is of fundamental importance to biological processes one mode of regulation is n myristylation which has eluded structural and functional characterization so far because most crystal structures are of the non myristylated enzyme are phosphorylated on ser  and generally lack electron density for the first  residues we crystallized myristylated wild type wt pka and a k c mutant as binary bound to a substrate peptide and ternary bound to a substrate peptide and adenosine       imido triphosphate complexes there was clear electron density for the entire n terminus in the binary complexes both refined to     and k c ternary complex refined to      the n termini in these three structures display a novel conformation with a previously unseen helix from residues  to  the k c mutant appears to have a more stable n terminus and this correlated with a significant decrease in the b factors for the n terminus in the myr k c complexes compared to the wt binary complex the n terminus of the myristylated wt ternary complex refined to     was disordered as in previous structures in addition to a more ordered n terminus the myristylated k c mutant exhibited a   increase in kcat the effect of nucleotide binding on the structure of the n terminus in the wt protein and the kinetic changes in the k c protein suggest that myristylation or occupancy of the myristyl binding pocket may serve as a site for allosteric regulation in the c subunit
