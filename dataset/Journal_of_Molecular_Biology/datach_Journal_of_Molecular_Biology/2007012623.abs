solution structure of escherichia coli papi a key regulator of the pap pili phase variation
pyelonephritis associated pili pap allow uropathogenic escherichia coli to bind to epithelial cells and play an important role in urinary tract infection expression of pap is controlled by a phase variation mechanism based on the two distinct heritable states that are the result of adenine n methylation in either of the two gatc sequences in its regulatory region the methylation status of these two sequences is sensed by the action of two proteins lrp and papi and they play a central role in determining pap gene expression in both phase on and phase off cells we used modern nmr techniques to determine the solution structure and backbone dynamics of papi we found its overall fold resembles closely that of the winged helix turn helix family of dna binding proteins we determined that papi possesses its own dna binding activity albeit non sequence specific independent of lrp papi appears to bind to dna with a kd in the    m range possible mechanisms by which papi might participate in the regulation of the pap operon are discussed in light of these new findings
