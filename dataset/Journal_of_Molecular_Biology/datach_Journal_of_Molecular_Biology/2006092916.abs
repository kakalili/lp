uncoupling of a clc cl  h exchange transporter by polyatomic anions
clc ec is a bacterial archetype of clc transporters a ubiquitous class of proteins that catalyze transmembrane exchange of cl  and h necessary for ph regulation of numerous physiological processes despite a profusion of high resolution structures the molecular mechanism of exchange remains unknown here we rigorously demonstrate strict exchange stoichiometry of  cl   h  in addition to cl  and br   two non halide ions no   and scn   are shown to be transported by clc ec  but with reduced h counter transport the loss of proton coupling to these anions is accompanied by an absence of bound anions in the central and external cl  binding sites in the protein s anion selectivity region as revealed by crystallographic comparison of br  and secn  bound to this region
