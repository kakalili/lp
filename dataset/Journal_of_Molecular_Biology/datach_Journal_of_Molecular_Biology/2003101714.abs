in vivo and in vitro evidence that the four essential intermediate filament if proteins a  a  a and b of the nematode caenorhabditis elegans form an obligate heteropolymeric if system
the in vitro polymerization and tissue specific expression patterns of the four essential intermediate filament if proteins a  a  a  b  and the non essential if protein a were analyzed recombinant b  used as a probe in blot overlay assays of the  caenorhabditis elegans if proteins reacted strongly with proteins a to a  indicating a heterotypic interaction obligate heteropolymeric filament assembly in vitro was confirmed by electron microscopy protein b formed long if when mixed with an equimolar amount of a  a or a  developmentally regulated coexpression of b and one or more members of the a family was found with gfp promoter reporters this coexpression pattern argues for a heteropolymer system in vivo one or both splice variants of the b gene are always coexpressed in a tissue specific manner with at least one member of the a family in hypodermis pharynx pharyngeal intestinal valve excretory cells uterus vulva and rectum interestingly while the intestine normally lacks a b a pair the dauer larva shows intestinal b and a  these results are in line with similar postembryonic phenotypes of the hypodermis induced by rna interference rnai of genes b  a and a  similarly defects of the pharynx and its a gfp containing tonofilaments observed in the postembryonic b rnai phenotype are consistent with the coexpression of b and a in the marginal cells thus rnai analyses provide independent evidence for the existence of the b a obligate heteropolymer system in vivo proteins a and b have a similar and rather slow turnover rate in photobleaching experiments of the pharynx tonofilaments
