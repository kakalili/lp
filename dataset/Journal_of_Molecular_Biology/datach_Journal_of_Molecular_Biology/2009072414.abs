affilin molecules selected against the human papillomavirus e protein inhibit the proliferation of target cells
intracellular binding proteins can be applied as research tools for target validation and study of protein function in cells and potentially as therapeutics the success of intracellular binding reagents depends on their affinity and specificity for target molecules although their stability and functionality in the intracellular environment actually determine their usefulness for such application alternative binding proteins derived from scaffolds devoid of disulfide bonds are well suited for intracellular use as their folding and stability are usually not impaired under reducing conditions here we describe the generation of intracellular binding reagents called affilin based on the human  b crystallin scaffold the target was human papillomavirus e protein implicated in the development of cervical cancer e binders were selected from the combinatorial  b crystallin library by conventional phage display technique affilin variants specifically bound the e protein with affinities in the nanomolar range intracellular expression of affilin molecules in e positive cells led to inhibition of cellular proliferation the effect was specific as the growth of e negative cells or cells expressing the wild type  b crystallin scaffold remained unaffected these results demonstrate that the  b crystallin scaffold allows the de novo generation of alternative binding proteins which are suitable for intracellular applications as they retain their functionality in the reducing environment of mammalian cells
