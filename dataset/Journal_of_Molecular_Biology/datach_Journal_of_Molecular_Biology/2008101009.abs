substrates and regulation mechanisms for the human mitochondrial sirtuins sirt and sirt
the enzymes of the sirtuin family of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dependent protein deacetylases are emerging key players in nuclear and cytosolic signaling but also in mitochondrial regulation and aging mammalian mitochondria contain three sirtuins sirt  sirt  and sirt  only one substrate is known for sirt as well as for sirt  and up to now no target for sirt has been reported here we describe the identification of novel substrates for the human mitochondrial sirtuin isoforms sirt and sirt  we show that sirt can deacetylate and thereby activate a central metabolic regulator in the mitochondrial matrix glutamate dehydrogenase furthermore sirt deacetylates and activates isocitrate dehydrogenase  an enzyme that promotes regeneration of antioxidants and catalyzes a key regulation point of the citric acid cycle sirt thus can regulate flux and anapleurosis of this central metabolic cycle we further find that the n and c terminal regions of sirt regulate its activity against glutamate dehydrogenase and a peptide substrate indicating roles for these regions in substrate recognition and sirtuin regulation sirt  in contrast to sirt  deacetylates none of the mitochondrial matrix proteins tested instead it can deacetylate cytochrome c a protein of the mitochondrial intermembrane space with a central function in oxidative metabolism as well as apoptosis initiation using a mitochondrial import assay we find that sirt can indeed be translocated into the mitochondrial intermembrane space but also into the matrix indicating that localization might contribute to sirt regulation and substrate selection
