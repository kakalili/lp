structural polymorphism of oligomeric adiponectin visualized by electron microscopy
adiponectin a macromolecular complex similar to the members of the c q and other collagenous homologues elicits diverse biological functions including anti diabetes anti atherosclerosis anti inflammation and anti tumor activities which have been directly linked to the high molecular weight hmw oligomeric structures formed by multiples of adiponectin trimers here we report the  d reconstructions of isolated full length recombinant murine c a adiponectin trimer and hexamer of wild type trimers the major hmw form determined by single particle analysis of electron micrographs the pleiomorphic ensemble of collagen like stretches of the trimers leads to a dynamic structure of hmw that partition into two major classes the fan shaped class i and bouquet shaped class ii  in both of these while the n termini cluster into a compact ellipsoid shaped               volume the collagenous domains assume a variety of arrangements the domains are splayed by up to     in class i can form a close packed up to        cylindrical assembly in class ii which can house about half of the  putative collagen like sequence and the rest tethered to the trimeric globular domains at the c terminus are highly dynamic as a result the globular domains elaborate a variety of arrangements covering an area of up to         and up to      apart some of which were captured in reconstructions of class ii our reconstructions suggest that the n terminal structured domain agreeing approximately with the expected volume for the octadecameric assembly of the terminal  amino acids is crucial to the formation of the functionally active hmw on the other hand conformational flexibility of the trimers at the c terminus can allow the hmw to access and cluster disparate target ligands binding to the globular domains which may be necessary to activate cellular signaling leading to the remarkable functional diversity of adiponectin
