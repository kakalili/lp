transient contacts on the exterior of the hk  procapsid that are essential for capsid assembly
the g loop is a  residue glycine rich loop that protrudes from the surface of the mature bacteriophage hk  capsid at the c terminal end of the long backbone helix of major capsid protein subunits the g loop is essential for assembly is conserved in related capsid and encapsulin proteins and plays its role during hk  capsid assembly by making crucial contacts between the hill like hexamers and pentamers in precursor proheads these contacts are not preserved in the flattened capsomers of the mature capsid aspartate   in each of the   g loops interacts with lysine   of the e loop extended loop of a subunit on an adjacent capsomer mutations disrupting this interaction prevented correct assembly and in some cases induced abnormal assembly into tubes or small incomplete capsids assembly remained defective when d  and k  were replaced with larger charged residues or when their positions were exchanged second site suppressors of lethal mutants containing substitution d  l replaced the ionic interaction with new interactions between neutral and hydrophobic residues of about the same size d  l k  v d  l k  i and d  l k  n we conclude that it is not the charge but the size and shape of the side chains of residues   and   that are important these two residues control the geometry of contacts between the e loop and the g loop which apparently must be precisely spaced and oriented for correct assembly to occur we present a model for how the g loop could control hk  assembly and identify g loop like protrusions in other capsid proteins that may play analogous roles
