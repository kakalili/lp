solution nmr structure of putidaredoxin  cytochrome p  cam complex via a combined residual dipolar coupling  spin labeling approach suggests a role for trp  of putidaredoxin in complex formation
the  kda complex formed between the  fe  s ferredoxin putidaredoxin pdx  and cytochrome p  cam cyp   from the bacterium pseudomonas putida has been investigated by high resolution solution nmr spectroscopy pdx serves as both the physiological reductant and effector for cyp  in the enzymatic reaction involving conversion of substrate camphor to  exo hydroxycamphor in order to obtain an experimental structure for the oxidized pdx  cyp  complex a combined approach using orientational data on the two proteins derived from residual dipolar couplings and distance restraints from site specific spin labeling of pdx has been applied spectral changes for residues in and near the paramagnetic metal cluster region of pdx in complex with cyp  have also been mapped for the first time using  n and  c nmr spectroscopy leading to direct identification of the residues strongly affected by cyp  binding the new nmr structure of the pdx  cyp  complex agrees well with results from previous mutagenesis and biophysical studies involving residues at the binding interface such as formation of a salt bridge between asp  of pdx and arg  of cyp   while at the same time identifying key features different from those of earlier modeling studies analysis of the binding interface of the complex reveals that the side chain of trp   the c terminal residue of pdx and critical for binding to cyp   is located across from the heme binding loop of cyp  and forms non polar contacts with several residues in the vicinity of the heme group on cyp   pointing to a potentially important role in complex formation
