a plant virus movement protein forms ringlike complexes with the major nucleolar protein fibrillarin in vitro
fibrillarin one of the major proteins of the nucleolus has methyltransferase activity directing   o ribose methylation of rrna and snrnas and is required for rrna processing the ability of the plant umbravirus groundnut rosette virus to move long distances through the phloem the specialized plant vascular system has been shown to strictly depend on the interaction of one of its proteins the orf protein protein encoded by open reading frame   with fibrillarin this interaction is essential for several stages in the groundnut rosette virus life cycle such as nucleolar import of the orf protein via cajal bodies relocalization of some fibrillarin from the nucleolus to cytoplasm and assembly of cytoplasmic umbraviral ribonucleoprotein particles that are themselves required for the long distance spread of the virus and systemic infection here using atomic force microscopy we determine the architecture of these complexes as single layered ringlike structures with a diameter of     nm and a height of      nm which consist of several n    distinct protein granules we also estimate the molar ratio of fibrillarin to orf protein in the complexes as approximately   based on these data we propose a model of the structural organization of fibrillarin  orf protein complexes and discuss potential mechanistic and functional implications that may also apply to other viruses
