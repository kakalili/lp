characterization of a divergent sec   gene in microsporidia
the general secretory sec pathway is the main mechanism for protein secretion and insertion into endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane in prokaryotes and eukaryotes however the complete genome of the highly specialized microsporidian parasite encephalitozoon cuniculi appears to lack a gene for sec   one of three universally conserved proteins that form the core of the sec translocon we have identified a putative highly divergent homologue of sec   in the genome of another microsporidian antonospora locustae and used this to identify a previously unrecognized sec   in e cuniculi the identity of these genes is supported by evidence from secondary structure prediction and gene order conservation their functional conservation is confirmed by expressing both microsporidian homologues in yeast where they are localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and rescue a yeast sec   deletion mutant
