native like  hairpin retained in the cold denatured state of bovine  lactoglobulin edited by p e wright
bovine  lactoglobulin is denatured by increased temperature heat denaturation and by decreased temperature cold denaturation in the presence of  m urea at ph   we characterized the structure of the cold denatured state of  lactoglobulin using circular dichroism cd  small angle x ray scattering saxs and heteronuclear nuclear magnetic resonance nmr  cd and saxs indicated that the cold denatured state in comparison with the highly denatured state induced by urea is rather compact retaining some secondary structure but no tertiary structure the location of the residual structures in the cold denatured state and their stability were characterized by h h exchange combined with heteronuclear nmr the results indicated that the residues adjacent to the disulfide bond c  c   connecting  strands g and h had markedly high protection factors suggesting the presence of a native like  hairpin stabilized by the disulfide bond since this  hairpin is conserved between different conformational states including the kinetic refolding intermediate it should be of paramount importance for the folding and stability of  lactoglobulin on the other hand the non native  helix suggested for the folding intermediate was not detected in the cold denatured state the h h exchange experiments showed that the protection factors of a mixture of the native and cold denatured states is strongly biased by that of the labile cold denatured state consistent with a two process model of the exchange
