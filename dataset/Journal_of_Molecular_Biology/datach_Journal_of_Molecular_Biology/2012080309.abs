histone h k q mutation an acetylation mimic causes structural disorder of its n terminal basic patch in the nucleosome
histone tails and their posttranslational modifications play important roles in regulating the structure and dynamics of chromatin for histone h  the basic patch k r h r  in the n terminal tail modulates chromatin compaction and nucleosome sliding catalyzed by atp dependent iswi chromatin remodeling enzymes while acetylation of h k  affects both functions the structural basis for the effects of this acetylation is unknown here we investigated the conformation of histone tails in the nucleosome by solution nmr we found that backbone amides of the n terminal tails of histones h a h b and h are largely observable due to their conformational disorder however only residues    in h can be detected indicating that residues     in the tails of both h histones fold onto the nucleosome core surprisingly we found that k q mutation in h  a mimic of k  acetylation leads to a structural disorder of the basic patch thus our study suggests that the folded structure of the h basic patch in the nucleosome is important for chromatin compaction and nucleosome remodeling by iswi enzymes while k  acetylation affects both functions by causing structural disorder of the basic patch k r h r
