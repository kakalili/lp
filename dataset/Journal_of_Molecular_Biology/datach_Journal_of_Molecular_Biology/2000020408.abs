reconstitution of the krab kap  repressor complex a model system for defining the molecular anatomy of ring b box coiled coil domain mediated protein protein interactions edited by p e wright
the krab domain is a  amino acid residue transcriptional repression module commonly found in eukaryotic zinc finger proteins krab mediated gene silencing requires binding to the corepressor kap  the krab kap  interaction requires the ring b box coiled coil rbcc domain of kap  which is a widely distributed motif hypothesized to be a protein protein interface little is known about rbcc mediated ligand binding and the role of the individual sub domains in recognition and specificity we have addressed these issues by reconstituting and characterizing the krab kap  rbcc interaction using purified components our results show that krab binding to kap  is direct and specific as the related rbcc domains from tif  and mid do not bind the krab domain a combination of gel filtration analytical ultracentrifugation chemical cross linking non denaturing gel electrophoresis and site directed mutagenesis techniques has revealed that the kap  rbcc must oligomerize likely as a homo trimer in order to bind the krab domain the ring finger b box and coiled coil region are required for oligomerization of kap  rbcc and krab binding as mutations in these domains concomitantly abolished these functions krab domain binding stabilized the homo oligomeric state of the kap  rbcc as detected by chemical cross linking and velocity sedimentation studies mutant kap  rbcc molecules hetero oligomerize with the wild type kap  but these complexes were inactive for krab binding suggesting a potential dominant negative activity substitution of the coiled coil region with heterologous dimerization trimerization or tetramerization domains failed to recapitulate krab domain binding chimeric kap  rbcc proteins containing either the ring ring b box or coiled coil regions from mid also failed to bind the krab domain the kap  rbcc mediates a highly specific direct interaction with the krab domain and it appears to function as an integrated possibly cooperative structural unit wherein each sub domain contributes to oligomerization and or ligand recognition these observations provide the first principles for rbcc domain mediated protein protein interaction and have implications for identifying new ligands for rbcc domain proteins
