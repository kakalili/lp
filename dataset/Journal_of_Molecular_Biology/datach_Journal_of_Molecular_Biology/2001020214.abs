preferential counterion binding to a tract dna oligomers edited by i tinoco
the free solution mobility of four  bp dna oligomers with and without a tracts has been measured by capillary electrophoresis in tris acetate buffer to test the hypothesis that site specific binding of monovalent counterions can occur in the narrow minor groove of a tract dnas preferential counterion binding has been proposed to cause a tract bending because of asymmetric charge neutralization and collapse of the helix backbone toward the minor groove preferential counterion binding in a tract dnas should be manifested by a decrease in the electrophoretic mobility observed in free solution compared to that of non a tract dnas of the same size of the four sequences studied here the slowest absolute mobility indicative of the greatest counterion binding was observed for a  bp oligomer containing two runs of a t in phase with the helix repeat a  mer containing phased caca sequences migrated with the fastest mobility   mers containing phased a tracts or phased runs of t a migrated with intermediate mobilities very similar mobility differences were observed when    mm nacl was added to the buffer the results suggest that preferential counterion binding occurs in a tract dnas especially those containing the antn sequence motif
