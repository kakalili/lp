small libraries of protein fragments model native protein structures accurately
prediction of protein structure depends on the accuracy and complexity of the models used here we represent the polypeptide chain by a sequence of rigid fragments that are concatenated without any degrees of freedom fragments chosen from a library of representative fragments are fit to the native structure using a greedy build up method this gives a one dimensional representation of native protein three dimensional structure whose quality depends on the nature of the library we use a novel clustering method to construct libraries that differ in the fragment length four to seven residues and number of representative fragments they contain       each library is characterized by the quality of fit accuracy and the number of allowed states per residue complexity  we find that the accuracy depends on the complexity and varies from    for a   state model on the basis of fragments of length      for a  state model on the basis of fragments of length  our goal is to find representations that are both accurate and economical low complexity  the models defined here are substantially better in this regard with ten states per residue we approximate native protein structure to   compared to over  states per residue needed previously for the same complexity we find that longer fragments provide better fits unfortunately libraries of longer fragments must be much larger for ten states per residue a seven residue library is   times larger than a five residue library  as the number of known protein native structures increases it will be possible to construct larger libraries to better exploit this correlation between neighboring residues our fragment libraries which offer a wide range of optimal fragments suited to different accuracies of fit may prove to be useful for generating better decoy sets for ab initio protein folding and for generating accurate loop conformations in homology modeling
