redesigning the nedd pathway with a bacterial genetic screen for ubiquitin like molecule transfer
pathways of ubiquitin like ubl molecule transfer regulate a myriad of cellular cascades here we report a high throughput assay that correlates catalytic human nedd transfer to bacterial survival the assay was utilized to screen mutant nedd and nae nedd activating enzyme libraries to engineer a more stable nedd and redesign the nedd  nae interface this approach will be useful in understanding the specificities underlying ubl pathways
