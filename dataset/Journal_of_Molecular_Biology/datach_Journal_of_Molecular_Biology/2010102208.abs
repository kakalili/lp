structural characterization of protein  protein complexes by integrating computational docking with small angle scattering data
x ray crystallography and nmr can provide detailed structural information of protein  protein complexes but technical problems make their application challenging in the high throughput regime other methods such as small angle x ray scattering saxs are more promising for large scale application but at the cost of lower resolution which is a problem that can be solved by complementing saxs data with theoretical simulations here we propose a novel strategy that combines saxs data and accurate protein  protein docking simulations the approach has been benchmarked on a large pool of known structures with synthetic saxs data and on three experimental examples the combined approach pydocksaxs provided a significantly better success rate   for the top  predictions than either of the two methods alone further analysis of the influence of different docking parameters made it possible to increase the success rates for specific cases and to define guidelines for improving the data driven protein  protein docking protocols
