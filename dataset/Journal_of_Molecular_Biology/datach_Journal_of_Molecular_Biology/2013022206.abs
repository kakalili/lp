serum deprivation confers the mda mb   breast cancer line with an egfr jak pld system that maximizes cancer cell invasion
our laboratory has reported earlier that in leukocytes phospholipase d  pld  is under control of janus kinase  jak  which mediates chemotaxis investigating jak in cancer cells led to an important discovery as exponentially growing mda mb   human breast cancer cells which are highly proliferative and metastatic did not substantially use jak to activate pld  however in  h or  h starved cell cultures jak switches to a pld enhancing role consistent with the needs of those cells to enter a  survival state  that relies on an increase in pld activity to withstand serum deprivation using a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor the flavonoid    trihydroxyflavone apigenin  as well as rna silencing we found that the invasive phenotype of mda mb   cells is mediated by pld under direct regulation of both jak and the tyrosine kinase epidermal growth factor receptor egfr  furthermore serum deprived cells in culture show an upregulated egfr jak pld pa system and are especially sensitive to a combination of jak and pld enzymatic activity inhibitors  nm apigenin and  nm  fluoro  indolyl des chlorohalopemide fipi  respectively  thus a multi layered activation of cell invasion by two kinases egfr and jak  and a phospholipase pld  provides regulatory flexibility and maximizes the aggressively invasive power of mda mb   breast cancer cells this is especially important in the absence of growth factors in serum coincidental with migration of these cells to new locations
