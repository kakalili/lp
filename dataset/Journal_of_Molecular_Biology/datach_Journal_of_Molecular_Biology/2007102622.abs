structural and kinetic characterization of quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase hqprtase from homo sapiens
human quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase ec      hqprtase is a member of the type ii phosphoribosyltransferase family involved in the catabolism of quinolinic acid qa  it catalyses the formation of nicotinic acid mononucleotide from quinolinic acid which involves a phosphoribosyl transfer reaction followed by decarboxylation hqprtase has been implicated in a number of neurological conditions and in order to study it further we have carried out structural and kinetic studies on recombinant hqprtase the structure of the fully active enzyme overexpressed in escherichia coli was solved using multiwavelength methods to a resolution of     hqprtase has a    barrel fold sharing a similar overall structure with the bacterial qprtases the active site of hqprtase is located at an    open sandwich structure that serves as a cup for the    barrel of the adjacent subunit with a qa binding site consisting of three arginine residues r   r  and r   and two lysine residues k  and k   mutation of these residues affected substrate binding or abolished the enzymatic activity the kinetics of the human enzyme are different to the bacterial enzymes studied hqprtase is inhibited competitively and non competitively by one of its substrates  phosphoribosylpyrophosphate prpp  the human enzyme adopts a hexameric arrangement which places the active sites in close proximity to each other
