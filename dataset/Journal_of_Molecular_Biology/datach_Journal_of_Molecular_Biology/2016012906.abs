functionally relevant specific packing can determine protein folding routes
functional residues can modulate the folding mechanisms of proteins in some proteins mutations to such residues can radically change the primary folding route is it possible then to learn more about the functional regions of a protein by investigating just its choice of folding route the folding and the function of the protein escherichia coli ribonuclease h ecornase h have been extensively studied and its folding route is known to near residue resolution here we computationally study the folding of ecornase h using molecular dynamics simulations of structure based models of increasing complexity the differences between a model that correctly predicts the experimentally determined folding route and a simpler model that does not can be attributed to a set of six aromatic residues clustered together in a region of the protein called core this clustering which we term  specific  packing drives core to fold early and determines the folding route both the residues involved in specific packing and their packing are largely conserved across e coli like rnase hs from diverse species residue conservation is usually implicated in function here the identified residues either are known to bind substrate in ecornase h or pack against the substrate in the homologous human rnase h where a substrate bound crystal structure exists thus the folding mechanism of ecornase h is a byproduct of functional demands upon its sequence using our observations on specific packing we suggest mutations to an engineered hiv rnase h to make its function better our results show that understanding folding route choice in proteins can provide unexpected insights into their function
