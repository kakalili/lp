atomic resolution structures of the apc c subunits apc and the apc n terminal domain
many essential biological processes are mediated by complex molecular machines comprising multiple subunits knowledge on the architecture of individual subunits and their positions within the overall multimeric complex is key to understanding the molecular mechanisms of macromolecular assemblies the anaphase promoting complex cyclosome apc c is a large multisubunit complex that regulates cell cycle progression by ubiquitinating cell cycle proteins for proteolysis by the proteasome the holo complex is composed of  different proteins that assemble to generate a complex of  subunits here we describe the crystal structures of apc and the n terminal domain of apc  apc n  apc comprises a wd  domain split by a long  helical domain whereas apc n has an  helical fold in a separate study we had fitted these atomic models to a    resolution cryo electron microscopy map of the apc c we describe how in the context of the apc c regions of apc disordered in the crystal assume order through contacts to apc  whereas apc n shows small conformational changes relative to its crystal structure we discuss the complementary approaches of high resolution electron microscopy and protein crystallography to the structure determination of subunits of multimeric complexes
