the reverse transcriptase encoded by the non ltr retrotransposon r is as error prone as that encoded by hiv
reverse transcriptases rts encoded by a wide range of mobile retroelements have had a major impact on the structure and function of genomes among the most abundant elements in eukaryotes are the non long terminal repeat ltr retrotransposons here we compare the dntp concentration requirements and error rates of the rt encoded by the non ltr retrotransposon r of bombyx mori with the well characterized rts of retroviruses surprisingly r was found to have properties more similar to those of lentiviral rts such as human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv   than to those of oncoretroviral rts such as murine leukemia virus like hiv  rt r rt was able to synthesize dna at low dntp concentrations suggesting that r is able to retrotranspose in nondividing cells r rt also showed levels of misincorporation in biased dntp pools and replication error rates in m  lacz  forward mutation assays similar to hiv  rt most of the r base substitutions in the forward mutation assay were caused by the misincorporation of dtmp analogous to hiv  the high error rate of r rt appears to be a result of its ability to extend mismatches once generated we suggest that the low fidelity of r rt is a by product of the flexibility of its active site dntp binding pocket required for the target primed reverse transcription reaction used by r for retrotransposition finally we discuss that in spite of the high r rt error rate the long term nucleotide substitution rate for r is not significantly above that associated with cellular dna replication based on the frequency of r retrotranspositions determined in natural populations
