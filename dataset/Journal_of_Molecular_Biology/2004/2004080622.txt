HU is an abundant, highly conserved protein associated with the bacterial chromosome. It belongs to a small class of proteins that includes the eukaryotic proteins TBP, SRY, HMG-I and LEF-I, which bind to DNA non-specifically at the minor groove. HU plays important roles as an accessory architectural factor in a variety of bacterial cellular processes such as DNA compaction, replication, transposition, recombination and gene regulation. In an attempt to unravel the role this protein plays in shaping nucleoid structure, we have carried out fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements of HU–DNA oligonucleotide complexes, both at the ensemble and single-pair levels. Our results provide direct experimental evidence for concerted DNA bending by HU, and the abrogation of this effect at HU to DNA ratios above about one HU dimer per 10–12 bp. These findings support a model in which a number of HU molecules form an ordered helical scaffold with DNA lying in the periphery. The abrogation of these nucleosome-like structures for high HU to DNA ratios suggests a unique role for HU in the dynamic modulation of bacterial nucleoid structure.
