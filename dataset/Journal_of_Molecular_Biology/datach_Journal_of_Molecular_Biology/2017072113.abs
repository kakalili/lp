siga  shigella immune complexes interact with dectin  and signr to differentially regulate mouse peyer s patch and mesenteric lymph node dendritic cell s responsiveness
in addition to contributing to immune exclusion at mucosal surfaces secretory iga siga made of polymeric iga and secretory component is able to selectively reenter via microfold cells into peyer s patches pps present along the intestine and to associate with dendritic cells dcs of the cd c cd b mhcii f    cd  phenotype in the subepithelial dome region and the draining mesenteric lymph nodes mlns  however the nature of the receptor s for siga on murine pp and mln dcs is unknown we find that glycosylated secretory component moiety and polymeric iga are both involved in the specific interaction with these cells using blocking antibodies and competition experiments we identify dectin  and specific intercellular adhesion molecule  grabbing non integrin receptor  signr  as receptors for siga while siga commensal immune complexes ics contribute to local homeostasis upon interaction with mucosal dcs the picture is less clear for pathogenic agents we find that in comparison with incubation of shigella flexneri alone association of the enteropathogen with siga prompts freshly isolated dcs from pps and mlns to invert the production of pro versus non inflammatory cytokines chemokines the sum of the data suggests that in contrast to igg based ics boosting immune reactivity of antigen presenting cells siga produced during an ongoing immune response can in addition to its known function of immune exclusion modulate mucosal dc conditioning via specific interaction with dectin  and signr
