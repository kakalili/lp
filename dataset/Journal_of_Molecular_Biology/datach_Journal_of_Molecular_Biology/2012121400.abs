biosynthesis of the  nd genetically encoded amino acid pyrrolysine structure and reaction mechanism of pylc at    resolution
the second step in the biosynthesis of the  nd genetically encoded amino acid pyrrolysine pyl is catalyzed by pylc that forms the pseudopeptide l lysine n  r methyl d ornithine here we present six crystal structures of the monomeric active ligase in complex with substrates reaction intermediates and products including atp the non hydrolyzable atp analogue    adenylyl       imidodiphosphate adp d ornithine d orn  l lysine lys  phosphorylated d  orn l lysine n  d ornithine inorganic phosphate carbonate and mg  the overall structure of pylc reveals similarities to the superfamily of atp grasp enzymes however there exist unique structural and functional features for a topological control of successive substrate entry and product release furthermore the presented high  resolution structures provide detailed insights into the reaction mechanism of isopeptide bond formation starting with phosphorylation of d  orn by transfer of a phosphate moiety from activated atp the binding of lys to the enzyme complex is then followed by an sn reaction resulting in l  lysine  n   d  ornithine and inorganic phosphate surprisingly pylc harbors two adenine nucleotides bound at the active site what has not been observed in any atp grasp protein analyzed to date whereas one atp molecule is involved in catalysis the second adenine nucleotide functions as a selective anchor for the c and n terminus of the lys substrate and is responsible for protein stability as shown by mutagenesis
