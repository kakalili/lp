the solution structure of a domain from the neisseria meningitidis lipoprotein pilp reveals a new  sandwich fold
type iv pili are long thin fibres which extend from the surface of the bacterial pathogen neisseria meningitidis they play a key role in adhesion and colonisation of host cells pilp is a lipoprotein suggested to be involved in the assembly and stabilization of an outer membrane protein pilq which is required for pilus formation here we describe the expression of a recombinant fragment of pilp spanning residues  to   and determination of the solution structure of a folded domain spanning residues  to   by nmr the n terminal third of the protein from residues  to   is apparently unfolded protease digestion yielded a   residue fragment that contained the folded domain the domain adopts a simple  sandwich type fold consisting of a three stranded  sheet packed against a four stranded  sheet there is also a short segment of   helix at the n terminal part of the folded domain we were unable to identify any other proteins that are closely related in structure to the pilp domain although the fold appears to be distantly related to the lipocalin family over  homologues of pilp have been identified in gram negative bacteria and the majority of conserved residues lie within the folded domain the fourth  strand and adjacent loop regions contain a high proportion of conserved residues including three glycine residues which seem to play a role in linking the two  sheets the two  sheets pack together to form a crevice lined with conserved hydrophobic residues we suggest that this feature could act as a binding site for a small ligand the results show that pilp and its homologues have a conserved folded domain at the c terminal end of the protein that may be involved in mediating binding to hydrophobic ligands
