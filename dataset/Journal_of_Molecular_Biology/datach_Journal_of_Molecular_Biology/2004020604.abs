association and dissociation kinetics for chey interacting with the p domain of chea
the chemotaxis system of escherichia coli makes use of an extended two component sensory response pathway in which chea an autophosphorylating protein histidine kinase phk rapidly passes its phosphoryl group to chey a phospho accepting response regulator protein rr  the chea  chey phospho transfer reaction is      times faster than the his  asp phospho relays that operate in other non chemotaxis two component regulatory systems suggesting that chea and chey have unique features that enhance his  asp phospho transfer kinetics one such feature could be the p domain of chea p encompasses a binding site for chey but an analogous rr binding domain is not found in other phks in previous work we removed p from chea and this decreased the catalytic efficiency of chea  chey phospho transfer by a factor of      here we examined the kinetics of the binding interactions between chey and p  the rapid association reaction kassn   m  s   at   c and     m exhibited a simple first order dependence on p concentration and appeared to be largely diffusion limited ionic strength   had a moderate effect on kassn in a manner predictable based on the calculated electrostatic interaction energy of the protein binding surfaces and the expected debye  h ckel shielding the speed of binding reflects in part electrostatic interactions but there is also an important contribution from the inherent plasticity of the complex and the resulting flexibility that this allows during the process of complex formation our results support the idea that the p domain of chea contributes to the overall speed of phospho transfer by promoting rapid association between chey and chea however this alone does not account for the ability of the chemotaxis system to operate much more rapidly than other two component systems kcat differences indicate that chea and chey also achieve the chemical events of phospho transfer more rapidly than do phk  rr pairs of slower systems
