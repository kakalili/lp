identification and role of functionally important motifs in the   loop of escherichia coli  s ribosomal rna
the   loop helix   of escherichia coli  s ribosomal rna contains two modified nucleotides m g  and m c   positions a   a   and c  are conserved among the bacteria archaea and eukarya the nucleotides present at positions           and   however are only conserved and unique within each domain all organisms contain a modified nucleoside at position   but the type of the modification is domain specific biochemical and structure studies have placed this loop near the p site and have shown it to be involved in the decoding process and in binding the antibiotic tetracycline to identify the functional components of this ribosomal rna hairpin the eight nucleotides of the   loop of helix  were subjected to saturation mutagenesis and   unique functional mutants were isolated and analyzed nonrandom nucleotide distributions were observed at each mutated position among the functional isolates nucleotide identity at positions   and   significantly affects ribosome function ribosomes with single mutations of m g  or m c  produce more protein in vivo than do wild type ribosomes overexpression of initiation factor  specifically restored wild type levels of protein synthesis to the   and   mutants suggesting that modification of these residues is important for initiation factor  binding and for the proper initiation of protein synthesis
