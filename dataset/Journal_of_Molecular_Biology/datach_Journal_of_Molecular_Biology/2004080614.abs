iron binding and oxidation kinetics in frataxin cyay of escherichia coli
friedreich s ataxia is associated with a deficiency in frataxin a conserved mitochondrial protein of unknown function here we investigate the iron binding and oxidation chemistry of escherichia coli frataxin cyay  a homologue of human frataxin with the aim of better understanding the functional properties of this protein anaerobic isothermal titration calorimetry itc demonstrates that at least two ferrous ions bind specifically but relatively weakly per cyay monomer kd    m  such weak binding is consistent with the hypothesis that the protein functions as an iron chaperone the bound fe ii is oxidized slowly by o  however oxidation occurs rapidly and completely with h o through a non enzymatic process with a stoichiometry of two fe ii h o  indicating complete reduction of h o to h o in accord with this stoichiometry electron paramagnetic resonance epr spin trapping experiments indicate that iron catalyzed production of hydroxyl radical from fenton chemistry is greatly attenuated in the presence of cyay the fe iii produced from oxidation of fe ii by h o binds to the protein with a stoichiometry of six fe iii cyay monomer as independently measured by kinetic uv  visible fluorescence iron analysis and ph stat titrations however as many as     fe iii monomer can bind to the protein exhibiting uv absorption properties similar to those of hydrolyzed polynuclear fe iii species analytical ultracentrifugation measurements indicate that a tetramer is formed when fe ii is added anaerobically to the protein multiple protein aggregates are formed upon oxidation of the bound fe ii  the observed iron oxidation and binding properties of frataxin cyay may afford the mitochondria protection against iron induced oxidative damage
