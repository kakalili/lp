evidence against involvement of aquaporin  in cell  cell adhesion
aquaporin  aqp  water channels are expressed strongly in glial cells where they play a role in brain water balance neuroexcitation and glial cell migration here we investigated a proposed new role of aqp in facilitating cell  cell adhesion measurements were made in differentiated primary glial cell cultures from wild type versus aqp knockout mice as well as in null versus aqp transfected l cells a cell type lacking endogenous adhesion molecules and in null versus aqp transfected chinese hamster ovary cho k cells and fisher rat thyroid cells using established assays of cell  cell adhesion we found no significant effect of aqp expression on adhesion in each of the cell types as a positive control transfection with e cadherin greatly increased cell  cell adhesion high level aqp expression also did not affect aggregation of plasma membrane vesicles in a sensitive quasi elastic light scattering assay further we found no specific aqp binding of a fluorescently labeled oligopeptide containing the putative adhesion sequence in the second extracellular loop of aqp  these data provide evidence against involvement of aqp in cell  cell adhesion
