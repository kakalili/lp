a large scale test of computational protein design folding and stability of nine completely redesigned globular proteins
a previously developed computer program for protein design rosettadesign was used to predict low free energy sequences for nine naturally occurring protein backbones rosettadesign had no knowledge of the naturally occurring sequences and on average   of the residues in the designed sequences differ from wild type synthetic genes for ten completely redesigned proteins were generated and the proteins were expressed purified and then characterized using circular dichroism chemical and temperature denaturation and nmr experiments although high resolution structures have not yet been determined eight of these proteins appear to be folded and their circular dichroism spectra are similar to those of their wild type counterparts six of the proteins have stabilities equal to or up to kcal mol greater than their wild type counterparts and four of the proteins have nmr spectra consistent with a well packed rigid structure these encouraging results indicate that the computational protein design methods can with significant reliability identify amino acid sequences compatible with a target protein backbone
