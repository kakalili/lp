thermodynamic analysis of mutant lac repressors
the lactose lac repressor is an allosteric protein that can respond to environmental changes mutations introduced into the dna binding domain and the effector binding pocket affect the repressor s ability to respond to its environment we have demonstrated how the observed phenotype is a consequence of altering the thermodynamic equilibrium constants we discuss mutant repressors which   show tighter repression   induce with a previously noninducing species orthonitrophenyl  d galactoside and   transform an inducible switch to one that is corepressed the ability of point mutations to change multiple thermodynamic constants and hence drastically alter the repressor s phenotype shows how allosteric proteins can perform a wide array of similar yet distinct functions such as that exhibited in the lac gal family of bacterial repressors
