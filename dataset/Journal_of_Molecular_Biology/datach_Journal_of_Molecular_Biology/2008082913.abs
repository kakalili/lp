internal hydration increases during activation of the g protein coupled receptor rhodopsin
rhodopsin the membrane protein responsible for dim light vision until recently was the only g protein coupled receptor gpcr with a known crystal structure as a result there is enormous interest in studying its structure dynamics and function here we report the results of three all atom molecular dynamics simulations each at least    s which predict that substantial changes in internal hydration play a functional role in rhodopsin activation we confirm with h magic angle spinning nmr that the increased hydration is specific to the metarhodopsin i intermediate the internal water molecules interact with several conserved residues suggesting that changes in internal hydration may be important during the activation of other gpcrs the results serve to illustrate the synergism of long time scale molecular dynamics simulations and nmr in enhancing our understanding of gpcr function
