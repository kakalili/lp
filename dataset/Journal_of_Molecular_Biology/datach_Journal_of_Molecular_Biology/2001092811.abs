leucine regulated self association of leucine responsive regulatory protein lrp from escherichia coli edited by m f moody
lrp is a global regulatory protein in escherichia coli that activates expression of more than a dozen operons and represses expression of another dozen for some operons exogenous leucine reduces the extent of lrp action for others it potentiates the effect of lrp and for yet other operons it has no effect in an effort to understand how leucine affects lrp mediated expression we examined lrp self association and the effect of leucine on self association using light scattering chemical cross linking and analytical ultracentrifugation the following results were obtained  i lrp self associates to a hexadecamer and octamer with the predominant species being hexadecamer at  m concentrations  ii lrp undergoes a leucine induced dissociation of hexadecamer to octamer  iii a mutant lrp lacking  amino acid residues at the c terminus does not form higher order oligomers suggesting that the c terminus is involved in subunit association  iv at nm concentrations lrp dissociates to a dimer it is proposed that leucine regulates the equilibrium between lrp oligomers and thus lrp occupancy of sites within different operons leading to diverse regulatory patterns
