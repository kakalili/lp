a buried polar residue in the hydrophobic interface of the coiled coil peptide gcn p  plays a thermodynamic not a kinetic role in folding
the hydrophobic interfaces of coiled coil proteins and peptides are typically interspersed with buried polar residues these polar residues are known to be important for defining oligomeric specificity and chain orientation in coiled coil formation however their effects on the folding assembly reaction have not been investigated the commonly studied  residue dimeric leucine zipper peptide gcn p  contains a single polar asn in the center of the hydrophobic interface at position   peptides containing either a valine or an alanine replacement at this position n v and n a respectively were studied in order to investigate both the thermodynamic and kinetic roles of the buried polar side chain on the folding of gcn p  equilibrium sedimentation confirmed that both the n v and n a mutations reduce the dimeric specificity of gcn p  leading to the population of both dimers and trimers in the absence of denaturant guanidine hydrochloride induced equilibrium unfolding of the mutant peptides demonstrated that n v is more stable than the wild type sequence while the n a peptide is moderately destabilized comparison of the refolding reactions indicate that asn  is not involved in the rate limiting association step leading to the native dimer only the unfolding reaction is sensitive to the mutations more complex unfolding kinetics for both peptides at high peptide concentrations can be attributed to the presence of trimers in the absence of denaturant these results show that the role of buried polar residues in leucine zipper peptides can be primarily thermodynamic subunit exchange reactions can be controlled by the stability of the native coiled coil and its influence on the unfolding dissociation process
