polymerase eta is a short lived proteasomally degraded protein that is temporarily stabilized following uv irradiation in saccharomyces cerevisiae
saccharomyces cerevisiae rad  is the homolog of human dna polymerase eta whose inactivation leads to the cancer prone syndrome xeroderma pigmentosum variant both human and yeast polymerase eta are responsible for error free bypass of uv induced cis syn pyrimidine dimers and several other dna lesions here we show using yeast strains expressing tap tagged rad  that the level of this protein is post translationally regulated via ubiquitination and proteasome mediated degradation the half life of rad  is   min and it increases due to proteasomal defects mutations inactivating components of the skp cullin f box scf ubiquitin ligase complex skp and the f box protein ufo stabilize rad  our results indicate also that ultraviolet irradiation causes transient stabilization of rad  which leads in turn to temporary accumulation of this polymerase in the cell we conclude that proteolysis plays an important role in regulating the cellular abundance of rad  these results are the first indication of a role for controlled proteasomal degradation in modulating cellular level of translesion dna polymerase in eukaryotes
