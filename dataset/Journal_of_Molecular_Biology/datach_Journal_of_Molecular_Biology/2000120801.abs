molecular cloning and expression of human udp d xylose proteoglycan core protein  d xylosyltransferase and its first isoform xt ii
human udp d xylose proteoglycan core protein  d xylosyltransferase ec      xt i initiates the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycan chains in proteoglycans by transferring xylose from udp xylose to specific serine residues of the core protein based on the partial amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme from human jar choriocarcinoma cell culture supernatant we isolated a cdna encoding xt i using the degenerate reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction method this enzyme which is involved in chondroitin sulfate heparan sulfate heparin and dermatan sulfate biosynthesis belongs to a novel family of glycosyltransferases with no homology to proteins known so far    and   race were performed to isolate a novel cdna fragment of   bp with a single open reading frame encoding at least   amino acid residues with a molecular mass of  kda the human xt i gene was located on chromosome  p   using radiation hybrid mapping and extracts from cho k cells transfected with the xt i cdna in an expression vector exhibited marked xt activity a new   bp cdna fragment encoding a protein of   amino acid residues was also isolated by pcr using degenerate primers based on the amino acid sequence of human xt i the amino acid sequence of this xt ii isoform displayed   identity to the human xt i the xt ii gene was located on chromosome  q    q  and the exon intron structure of the  kb gene was determined rt pcr analyses of xt i and xt ii mrna from various tissues confirmed that both xt i and xt ii transcripts are ubiquitously expressed in the human tissues although with different levels of transcription furthermore the cdnas encoding xt i and xt ii from rat were cloned the deduced amino acid sequences of rat xylosyltransferases displayed   identity to the corresponding human enzyme
