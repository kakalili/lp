alu mediated phylogenetic novelties in gene regulation and development edited by j karn
differential gene expression lies at the heart of biology and is responsible for all developmental processes including the growth and differentiation of cells perhaps even speciation could be defined as a change in differential gene expression over evolutionary time the present work is a phylogenetic study of four alu elements known to have gene regulatory functions in the human the four elements have been shown to regulate the parathyroid hormone pth gene via a negative calcium response element the hematopoietic cell specific fc ri  receptor gene via a cis acting positive negative regulatory element the cns specific nicotinic acetylcholine receptor   gene via a cis acting positive negative control element and the t cell specific cd  gene via a complex transcriptional regulator the four alu elements that impact differential gene expression were found to be differentially distributed among seven primate species human chimpanzee gorilla orangutan baboon rhesus and macaque in a way that is congruent with an accepted phylogeny of these species the results establish a link between gene regulation and the divergence of primates this evolutionary variation in gene regulation also suggests a novel experimental system to study the very complex transcriptional regulation of gene expression by studying side by side the regulation of the same gene from two primate species that differ in the cis acting regulatory elements of the gene
