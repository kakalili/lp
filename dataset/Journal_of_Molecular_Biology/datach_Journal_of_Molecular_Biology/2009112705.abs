the higher structure of chromatin in the lcr of the  globin locus changes during development
the  globin locus control region lcr is able to enhance the expression of all globin genes throughout the course of development however the chromatin structure of the lcr at the different developmental stages is not well defined we report dnase i and micrococcal nuclease hypersensitivity chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses for histones h a h b h  and h  and c chromatin conformation capture assays of the normal and mutant  globin loci which demonstrate that nucleosomes at the dnase i hypersensitive sites of the lcr could be either depleted or retained depending on the stages of development furthermore mnase sensitivity and c assays suggest that the lcr chromatin is more open in embryonic erythroblasts than in definitive erythroblasts at the primary and secondary structure levels however the lcr chromatin is packaged more tightly in embryonic erythroblasts than in definitive erythroblasts at the tertiary chromatin level our study provides the first evidence that the occupancy of nucleosomes at a dnase i hypersensitive site is a developmental stage related event and that embryonic and adult cells possess distinct chromatin structures of the lcr
