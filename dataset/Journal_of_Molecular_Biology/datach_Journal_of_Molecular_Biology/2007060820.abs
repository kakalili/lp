distinct steps of cross linking self association and maturation of tropoelastin are necessary for elastic fiber formation
elastic fibers play an important role in the characteristic resilience of many tissues the assembly of tropoelastin into a fibrillar matrix is a complex stepwise process and the deposition and cross linking of tropoelastin are believed to be key steps of elastic fiber formation however the detailed mechanisms of elastic fiber assembly have not been defined yet here we demonstrate the relationship between deposition and the cross linking maturation of tropoelastin our data show that a c terminal half fragment of tropoelastin encoded by exons     bh is deposited onto microfibrils yet we detect very limited amounts of the cross linking amino acid desmosine an indicator of maturation whereas the n terminal half fragment encoded by exons     fh was deficient for both deposition and cross linking suggesting that elastic fiber formation requires full length tropoelastin molecules a series of experiments using mutant bh fragments lacking either exon  or   or a deletion of both exons showed that self association of tropoelastin polypeptides was an early step in elastic fiber assembly immunofluorescence and western blot assay showed that the treatment of cell culture medium or conditioned medium with  aminopropionitrile to inhibit cross linking prevented both the deposition and polymerization of tropoelastin in conclusion our present results support the view that self association and oxidation by lysyl oxidase precedes tropoelastin deposition onto microfibrils and the entire molecule of tropoelastin is required for this following maturation process
