requirement of helix p  and nucleotide g for positioning the cleavage site and cofactor of the glms ribozyme
the glms ribozyme is a catalytic rna that self cleaves at its   end in the presence of glucosamine  phosphate glcn p  we present structures of the glms ribozyme from thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis that are bound with the cofactor glcn p or the inhibitor glucose  phosphate glc p at     and     resolution respectively the two structures are indistinguishable in the conformations of the small molecules and of the rna glcn p binding becomes apparent crystallographically when the ph is raised to   where the ribozyme conformation is identical with that observed previously at ph   a key structural feature of this ribozyme is a short duplex p   that is formed between sequences just   of the cleavage site and within the core domain and which introduces a pseudoknot into the active site mutagenesis indicates that p  is required for activity in cis acting and trans acting forms of the ribozyme p  formation in a trans acting ribozyme was exploited to demonstrate that n of the guanine at position  contributes to glcn p binding by interacting with the phosphate of the cofactor at neutral ph rnas with adenine  aminopurine dimethyladenine or purine substitutions at position  cleave faster with glucosamine than with glcn p this altered cofactor preference provides biochemical support for the orientation of the cofactor within the active site our results establish two features of the glms ribozyme that are important for its activity a sequence within the core domain that selects and positions the cleavage site sequence and a nucleobase at position  that helps position glcn p
