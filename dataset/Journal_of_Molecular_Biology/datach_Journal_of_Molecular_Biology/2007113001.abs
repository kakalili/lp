exploring the mitochondrial proteome of the ciliate protozoon tetrahymena thermophila direct analysis by tandem mass spectrometry
to date direct analysis of mitochondrial proteomes has largely been limited to animals fungi and plants to broaden our knowledge of mitochondrial structure and function and to provide additional insight into the evolution of this key eukaryotic organelle we have undertaken the first comprehensive analysis of the mitochondrial proteome of a protist highly purified mitochondria from tetrahymena thermophila a ciliated protozoon were digested exhaustively with trypsin and the resulting peptides subjected to tandem liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc lc ms ms  in this way we directly identified a total of   mitochondrial proteins   of which are encoded by the nuclear genome and  by the mitochondrial genome the latter number includes a novel   residue protein which we designate ymf  that had not been recognized during annotation of the t thermophila mtdna sequence the corresponding gene ymf  is highly conserved in genomic position size and sequence within the genus tetrahymena our analysis has provided broad coverage of both membrane bound and soluble proteins from the various submitochondrial compartments with prominent representatives including components of the tricarboxylic acid cycle complexes i  iv of the electron transport chain and complex v atp synthase  the mitochondrial transcription and translation machinery the tom and tim protein translocases various mitochondrial transporters chaperonins cpn  hsp  hsp   at least four ftsh family atp dependent metalloproteases implicated in m aaa and i aaa protease function and enzymes involved in lipid amino acid and coenzyme metabolism as well as iron  sulfur cluster formation unexpectedly six of the ten enzymes of glycolysis were found by ms analysis of purified t thermophila mitochondria whereas no hits were seen to any cytosolic ribosomal proteins at least one of the glycolytic proteins enolase has an evident n terminal extension that exhibits characteristics of a typical mitochondrial targeting peptide as in other organisms phylogenetic analysis of functionally annotated mitochondrial proteins demonstrates that lt   can be traced confidently to the  proteobacterial lineage of bacteria emphasizing the chimeric evolutionary nature of the mitochondrial proteome notably about   of the proteins identified in our analysis have no known function and most of these do not have obvious homologs outside of the ciliate lineage about two thirds of these orfan proteins have putative homologs in another ciliate paramecium tetraurelia whereas the remainder appear to be tetrahymena specific these results emphasize the power and importance of direct ms based analysis of mitochondria in revealing novel mitochondrial proteins in different eukaryotic lineages our observations reinforce an emerging view of the mitochondrion as an evolutionarily flexible organelle with novel proteins and presumably functions being added in a lineage specific fashion to an ancient highly conserved functional core much of which was contributed by the presumptive  proteobacterial symbiont from which the mitochondrial genome was derived
