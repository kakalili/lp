myxoma virus immunomodulatory protein m  r is a structural mimic of eukaryotic translation initiation factor eif
phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eif on ser  of its  subunit is a key event for regulation of protein synthesis in all eukaryotes m  r the product of the myxoma virus m  r open reading frame has sequence similarity to eif  as well as to a family of viral proteins that bind to the interferon induced protein kinase pkr and inhibit phosphorylation of eif   in this study we demonstrate that like eif   m  r is an efficient substrate for phosphorylation by pkr and can compete with eif   to gain insights into the substrate specificity of the eif  kinases we have determined the nuclear magnetic resonance nmr structure of m  r the first structure of a myxoma virus protein the fold consists of a five stranded antiparallel  barrel with two of the strands connected by a loop and an  helix the similarity between m  r and the  barrel structure in the n terminus of eif  suggests that the viral homologs mimic eif  structure in order to compete for binding to pkr a homology modeled structure of the well studied vaccinia virus k l was generated on the basis of alignment with m  r comparison of the structures of the k l model m  r and human eif  indicated that residues important for binding to pkr are located at conserved positions on the surface of the  barrel and in the mobile loop identifying the putative pkr recognition motif
