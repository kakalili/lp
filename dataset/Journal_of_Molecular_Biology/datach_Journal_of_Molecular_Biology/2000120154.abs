structural homology between dna binding sites of dna polymerase  and dna topoisomerase ii edited by a fersht
unsaturated long chain fatty acids selectively bind to the dna binding sites of dna polymerase  and dna topoisomerase ii and inhibit their activities although the amino acid sequences of these enzymes are markedly different from each other computer modeling analysis revealed that the fatty acid interaction interface in both enzymes has a group of four amino acid residues in common forming a pocket which binds to the fatty acid molecule the four amino acid residues were thr   his   leu  and lys  for yeast dna topoisomerase ii corresponding to thr  his  leu  and lys  for rat dna polymerase   using three dimensional structure model analysis we determined the spatial positioning of specific amino acid residues binding to the fatty acids in dna topoisomerase ii and subsequently obtained supplementary information to build the structural model
