sequence analysis of the genome of the temperate yersinia enterocolitica phage py
the temperate yersinia phage py  belongs to the unusual group of phages that replicate as linear plasmids with covalently closed ends besides escherichia coli phage n  py  is the only member of this group to be identified we have determined the complete sequence     bp of the py  genome bioinformatic analyses revealed  open reading frames orfs with good coding potential located on both dna strands the comparison of the deduced py  gene products with known proteins encoded by other phages and bacteria along with functional studies have enabled us to assign the possible functions of  orfs in the left arm of the py  genome we identified a number of orfs that obviously code for head and tail proteins furthermore this part of the phage genome contains genes probably involved in plasmid partitioning regarding the predicted gene functions and gene order the py  and n  left arms are similar however there are only weak dna homologies and in contrast to n  the yersinia phage harbours only a few orfs related to genes found in lambdoid phages the py  right arm comprises mainly regulatory genes as well as genes important for plasmid replication dna methylation and host cell lysis out of  deduced products of the right arm   revealed strongest database homologies to n  proteins of which the protelomerase and the rep protein are exclusively homologous to their n  counterparts a number of py  genes essential for the lytic or lysogenic cycle were identified by functional analysis and characterization of phage mutants in order to study transcription during the lytic and lysogenic stage we analysed  py  orfs by reverse transcriptase rt pcr the phage transcription patterns in lysogenic bacteria and at the late lytic stage of infection are nearly identical the reasons for this finding are spontaneous release of phages during lysogeny and a high rate of phages that lysogenize their yersinia host upon infection
