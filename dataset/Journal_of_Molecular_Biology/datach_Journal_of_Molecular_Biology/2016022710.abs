efficient genome manipulation by variants of site specific recombinases r and td
genome engineering benefits from the availability of dna modifying enzymes that have different target specificities and have optimized performance in different cell types this variety of site specific enzymes can be used to develop complex genome engineering applications at multiple loci although eight yeast site specific tyrosine recombinases are known only flp is actively used in genome engineering to expand the pool of the yeast site specific tyrosine recombinases capable of mediating genome manipulations in mammalian cells we engineered and analyzed variants of two tyrosine recombinases r and td the activity of the evolved variants unlike the activity of the native r and td recombinases is suitable for genome engineering in escherichia coli and mammalian cells unexpectedly we found that r recombinase benefits from the shortening of its c terminus we also found that the activity of wild type r can be modulated by its non consensus  head  sequence but this modulation became not apparent in the evolved r variants the engineered recombinase variants were found to be active in all recombination reactions tested excision integration and dual recombinase mediated cassette exchange the analysis of the latter reaction catalyzed by the r td recombinase pair shows that the condition supporting the most efficient replacement reaction favors efficient td mediated integration reaction while favoring efficient r mediated integration and deletion reactions
