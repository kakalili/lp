three dimensional view of the surface motif associated with the p loop structure cis and trans cases of convergent evolution edited by j thornton
here we identify the determinants of the nucleotide binding ability associated with the p loop containing proteins inferring their functional importance from their structural convergence to a unique three dimensional  d motif   a new surface d pattern is identified for the p loop nucleotide binding region which is more selective than the corresponding sequence pattern   the signature displays one residue that we propose is the determinant for the guanine binding ability the residues aligned to ras d   this residue is known to be important only in the g proteins we extend the prediction to all the other p loop containing proteins  and   two cases of convergent evolution at the molecular level are highlighted in the analysis of the active site the positive charge aligned to ras k  and the arginine residues aligned to the gap arginine finger the analysis of the residues conserved on protein surfaces allows one to identify new functional or evolutionary relationships among protein structures that would not be detectable by conventional sequence or structure comparison methods
