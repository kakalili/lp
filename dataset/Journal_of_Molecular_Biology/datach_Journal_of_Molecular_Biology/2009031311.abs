analysis of transmembrane helix integration in the endoplasmic reticulum in s cerevisiae
what sequence features in integral membrane proteins determine which parts of the polypeptide chain will form transmembrane  helices and which parts will be located outside the lipid bilayer previous studies on the integration of model transmembrane segments into the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum er have provided a rather detailed quantitative picture of the relation between amino acid sequence and membrane integration propensity for proteins targeted to the sec  translocon we have now carried out a comparative study of the integration of nout  cin orientated  residue long polypeptide segments into the er of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae we find that the  threshold hydrophobicity  required for insertion into the er membrane is very similar in s cerevisiae and in mammalian cells further when comparing the contributions to the apparent free energy of membrane insertion of the  natural amino acids between the s cerevisiae and the mammalian er we find that the two scales are strongly correlated but that the absolute difference between the most hydrophobic and most hydrophilic residues is   fold smaller in s cerevisiae
