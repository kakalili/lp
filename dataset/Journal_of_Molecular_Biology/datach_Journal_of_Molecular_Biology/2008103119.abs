crystal structure of metastasis associated protein s  a in the active calcium bound form
s  a  metastasin is a member of the s  family of calcium binding proteins that is directly involved in tumorigenesis until recently the only structural information available was the solution nmr structure of the inactive calcium free form of the protein here we report the crystal structure of human s  a in the active calcium bound state at     resolution that was solved by molecular replacement in the space group p  with two molecules in the asymmetric unit from perfectly merohedrally twinned crystals the ca  bound s  a structure reveals a large conformational change in the three dimensional structure of the dimeric s  a protein upon calcium binding this calcium dependent conformational change opens up a hydrophobic binding pocket that is capable of binding to target proteins such as annexin a  the tumor suppressor protein p  and myosin iia the structure of the active form of s  a provides insight into its interactions with its binding partners and a better understanding of its role in metastasis
