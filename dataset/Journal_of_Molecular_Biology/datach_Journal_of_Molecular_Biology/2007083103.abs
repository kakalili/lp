directed evolution of p  variants with altered dna binding specificities by in vitro compartmentalization
the p  tumour suppressor governs cell fate by differential transactivation of a spectrum of target genes to further understand how p  discriminates between target promoters we have for the first time used in vitro compartmentalization ivc to evolve variants with greater affinity for the distal p  response element in the promoter of the p  gene involved in cell cycle arrest and for the low affinity bs response element of the pro apoptotic puma gene these variants have mutations in the l loop of the p  dna binding domain and in the n terminal proline rich domain the in vitro binding phenotype of these variants extends to both increased transactivation of promoters containing the response elements in reporter gene studies and increased up regulation of endogenous p  as compared to wild type p  one variant was co selected for increased binding to both response elements yet displayed increased apoptotic function this result supports the notion that prediction of phenotypic outcome based on transcriptional activation of individual genes is confounded by the networked complexity of the p  response
