structural basis for sry dependent  x y sex reversal modulation of dna bending by a naturally occurring point mutation
the hmg box domain of the human male sex determining factor sry hsryhmg comprising residues    of the full length sequence  binds dna sequence specifically in the minor groove resulting in substantial dna bending the majority of point mutations resulting in  x y sex reversal are located within this domain one clinical de novo mutation m i in the full length hsry sequence which corresponds to m i in the present hsryhmg construct acts principally by reducing the extent of dna bending to elucidate the structural consequences of the m i mutation we have solved the d solution structures of wild type and m i hsryhmg complexed to a dna  mer by nmr including the use of residual dipolar couplings to derive long range orientational information we show that the average bend angle derived from an ensemble of   simulated annealing structures for each complex is reduced by     from      in the wild type complex to      in the m i complex the difference in dna bending can be localized directly to changes in roll and tilt angles in the apa base pair step involved in interactions with residue  and partial intercalation of ile  the larger bend angle in the wild type complex arises as a direct consequence of steric repulsion of the sugar of the second adenine by the bulky s  atom of met  whose position is fixed by a hydrogen bond with the guanidino group of arg  in the m i mutant this hydrogen bond can no longer occur and the less bulky c m methyl group of ile braces the sugar moieties of the two adenine residues thereby decreasing the roll and tilt angles at the apa step by    and     respectively and resulting in an overall difference in bend angle of     between the two complexes to our knowledge this is one of the first examples where the effects of a clinical mutation involving a protein dna complex have been visualized at the atomic level
