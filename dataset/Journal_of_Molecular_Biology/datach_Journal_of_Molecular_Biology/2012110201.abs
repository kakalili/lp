structural basis of substrate specificity and selectivity of murine cytosolic   nucleotidase iii
cytosolic   nucleotidase iii cn iii is responsible for selective degradation of pyrimidine   monoribonucleotides during maturation of reticulocytes to erythrocytes the lack of this enzymatic activity due to genetic aberrations or lead poisoning results in a mild to moderate nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia in affected individuals pyrimidine nucleotides as well as their precursor polymers and their off path metabolites accumulate in erythrocytes interfering with their proper function in ways that are not yet fully understood this report describes the first x ray structure of a catalytically inactivated variant of murine cn iii with a natural substrate uridine   monophosphate in the active site at    resolution the structure captures in an atomic detail the closed conformation that cn iii adopts upon substrate binding structure and sequence analysis coupled with enzymatic characterization of several mutants confirmed that the aromatic ring of a nitrogenous base of substrate nucleotide is stabilized by parallel  stacking interactions with conserved aromatic rings of trp  and his  the nitrogenous base is further stabilized by t shaped stacking with the conserved aromatic ring of tyr   as well as by polar contacts with side chains of thr  and ser   two water molecules help to stabilize the nucleotide binding by bridging it to protein residues asp  and his  via hydrogen bonds finally fully conserved glu  is responsible for recognition of ribose ring via two hydrogen bonds the presented substrate complex structure elucidates how cn iii achieves specificity for pyrimidine   nucleotides and how it selects against purine   nucleotides
