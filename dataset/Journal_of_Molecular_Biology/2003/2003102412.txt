The binding component C2II of the binary actin ADP-ribosylating C2-toxin from Clostridium botulinum is essential for intoxication of target cells. Activation by a protease leads to channel formation and this is presumably required for the transport of the toxic C2I component into cells. The C2II-channel is cation selective and contains a binding site for fluphenazine and structurally related compounds. Ion transport through C2II and in vivo intoxication is blocked when the sites are occupied by the ligands. C2II was reconstituted into artificial lipid bilayer membranes and formed ion permeable channels. The binding constant of chloroquine, primaquine, quinacrine, chloropromazine and fluphenazine to the C2II-channel was determined using titration experiments, which resulted in its block. The ligand-induced current noise of the C2II-channels was investigated using fast Fourier transformation. The noise of the open channels had a rather small spectral density, which was a function of the inverse frequency up to about 100 Hz. Upon addition of ligands to the aqueous phase the current through C2II decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Simultaneously, the spectral density of the current noise increased drastically and its frequency dependence was of Lorentzian type, which was caused by the on and off-reactions of the ligand-mediated channel block. The ligand-induced current noise of C2II was used for the evaluation of the binding kinetics for different ligands to the channel. The on-rate constant of ligand binding was between 107 and 109M−1s−1 and was dependent on the ionic strength of the aqueous phase. The off-rate varied between about 10 s−1 and 3900 s−1 and depended on the structure of the ligand. The role of structural requirements for the effective block of C2II by the different ligands is discussed.
