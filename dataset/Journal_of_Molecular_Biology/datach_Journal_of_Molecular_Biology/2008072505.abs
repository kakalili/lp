glucose regulates the expression of the apolipoprotein a gene
the apolipoprotein a gene apoa  is a key player in determining triglyceride concentrations in humans and mice since diabetes is often associated with hypertriglyceridemia this study explores whether apoa gene expression is regulated by alteration in glucose homeostasis and the related pathways d glucose activates apoa gene expression in a time and dose dependent manner in hepatocytes and the glycolytic pathway involved was determined using d glucose analogues and metabolites together transient transfections electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that this regulation occurs at the transcriptional level through an increase of usf  binding to an e box in the apoa promoter we show that this phenomenon is not due to an increase of mrna or protein expression levels of usf using protein phosphatases  and a inhibitor we demonstrate that d glucose regulates the apoa gene via a dephosphorylation mechanism resulting in an enhanced usf  promoter binding last subsequent suppressions of usf  and phosphatases mrna through sirna gene silencing abolished the regulation we demonstrate that the apoa gene is up regulated by d glucose and usf through phosphatase activation these findings may provide a new cross talk between glucose and lipid metabolism
