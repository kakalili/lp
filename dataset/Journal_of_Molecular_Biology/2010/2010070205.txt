Human guanylate binding protein 1 (hGBP1) belongs to the dynamin superfamily of large GTPases (LGs). In the course of GTP hydrolysis, the protein undergoes structural changes leading to self-assembly of the protein, which is a characteristic property of all family members. For self-assembly, the protein employs two distinct interaction sites, one of which is located within the LG domain of the protein located at the N-terminus, and the second is located in the C-terminal Î±-helical domain. Here, we identify intramolecular contacts between the LG domain and the helical part of hGBP1, which relay nucleotide-dependent structural changes from the N-terminus to the C-terminus and thereby mediate tetramer formation of the protein through a second contact site at the C-terminus. Furthermore, we demonstrate the impact of this intramolecular communication on the enzymatic activity of hGBP1 and on its cellular localization.
