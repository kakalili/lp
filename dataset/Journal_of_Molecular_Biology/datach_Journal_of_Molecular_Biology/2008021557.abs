crystal structure of the actin binding domain of  actinin  lys  glu mutant implicated in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis
mutations in  actinin  have been linked to familial focal segmental glomerulosclerosis fsgs  a common renal disorder in humans and produce an apparent increase in the actin binding affinity of  actinin  in vitro one of the mutations in particular lys  glu falls in the middle of the actin binding interface of the actin binding domain abd  the abd consists of tandem calponin homology ch domains ch and ch  the crystal structures of most abds display a compact conformation characterized by extensive inter ch interactions however the conformation of f actin bound abds is unsettled some electron microscopy studies find that the compact conformation is preserved upon binding to f actin whereas other studies suggest that the chs separate and the abd becomes extended the lys  glu mutation in ch is significant in this regard since it removes a crucial inter ch interaction with trp  of ch  thought to stabilize the compact conformation together the increased actin binding affinity and the removal of this important inter ch contact suggested that the lys  glu mutation might facilitate the transition toward the open abd conformation proposed by some of the electron microscopy studies however the crystal structure of the abd of  actinin  lys  glu mutant described here displays the canonical compact conformation furthermore the sedimentation coefficients by analytical ultracentrifugation of wild type and fsgs mutant abds lys  glu ser  pro and thr  ile are nearly identical       s and are in good agreement with the theoretical value calculated from the crystal structure     s  implying that the compact conformation is retained in solution the absence of a structural change suggests that the compact abd conformation observed in the majority of the structures is highly stable and is preserved in solution even in fsgs mutant abds
