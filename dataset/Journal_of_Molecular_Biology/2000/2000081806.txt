Structural studies of protein-DNA complexes have shown that there are many distinct families of DNA-binding proteins, and have shown that there is no simple “code” describing side-chain/base interactions. However, systematic analysis and comparison of protein-DNA complexes has been complicated by the diversity of observed contacts, the sheer number of complexes currently available and the absence of any consistent method of comparison that retains detailed structural information about the protein-DNA interface. To address these problems, we have developed geometric methods for characterizing the local structural environment in which particular side-chain/base interactions are observed. In particular, we develop methods for analyzing and comparing spatial relationships at the protein-DNA interface. Our method involves attaching local coordinate systems to the DNA bases and to the Cα atoms of the peptide backbone (these are relatively rigid structural units). We use these tools to consider how the position and orientation of the polypeptide backbone (with respect to the DNA) helps to determine what contacts are possible at any given position in a protein-DNA complex. Here, we focus on base contacts that are made in the major groove, and we use spatial relationships in analyzing: (i) the observed patterns of side-chain/base interactions; (ii) observed helix docking orientations; (iii) family/subfamily relationships among DNA-binding proteins; and (iv) broader questions about evolution, altered specificity mutants and the limits for the design of new DNA-binding proteins. Our analysis, which highlights differences in spatial relationships in different complexes and at different positions in a complex, helps explain why there is no simple, general code for protein-DNA recognition.
