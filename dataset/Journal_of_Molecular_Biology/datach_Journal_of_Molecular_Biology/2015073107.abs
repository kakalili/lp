icosa a distance dependent orientation specific coarse grained contact potential for protein structure modeling
the relative distance and orientation in contacting residue pairs plays a significant role in protein folding and stabilization we hereby devise a new knowledge based coarse grained contact potential so called icosa by correlating inter residue contact distance and orientation in evaluating pair wise inter residue interactions the rationale of our approach is to establish icosahedral local coordinates to estimate the statistical residue contact distributions in all spherical triangular shells within a sphere we extend the theory of finite ideal gas reference state to icosahedral local coordinates icosa incorporates long range contact interactions which is critical to icosa sensitivity and is justified in statistical rigor with only backbone atoms information icosa is at least comparable to all atom fine grained potentials such as rosetta dfire i tasser and opus in discriminating near natives from misfold protein conformations in the rosetta and i tasser protein decoy sets icosa also outperforms a set of widely used coarse grained potentials and is comparable to all atom fine grained potentials in identifying casp  models
