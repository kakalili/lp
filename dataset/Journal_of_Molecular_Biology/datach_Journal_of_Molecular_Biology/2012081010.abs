selective molecular recognition in amyloid growth and transmission and cross species barriers
mutual conformational selection and population shift followed by minor induced fit optimization is the key mechanism in biomolecular recognition and monomers and small oligomers binding to amyloid seeds in fibril growth is a molecular recognition event here we describe amyloid aggregation preferred species cross species barriers and transmission within the broad framework of molecular recognition cross seeding of amyloid species is governed by conformational selection of compatible complementary states if the dominant conformations of two species are similar they can cross seed each other on the other hand if they are sufficiently different they will grow into different fibrils reflecting species barriers such a scenario has recently been observed for the tau protein which has four repeats while a construct consisting of repeats   and  can serve as a seed for the entire four repeat tau segment the inverse does not hold on the other hand the tau protein repeats with the characteristic u turn shape can cross seed alzheimer s amyloid  and similarly the islet amyloid polypeptide within this framework we suggest that the so called  central dogma  of amyloid formation where aggregation takes place through nonspecific backbone hydrogen bonding interactions which are common to all peptides and proteins is a simple reflection of the heterogeneous polymorphic free energy landscape of amyloid species here we review available data and make some propositions addressing this key problem in particular we argue that recent theoretical and experimental observations support the key role of selective molecular recognition in amyloidosis and in determining cross species barriers and transmission
