the retinal specific cd  ig domain from molecular structure to biological activity
cd  is a type i transmembrane protein that is involved in inflammatory diseases cancer progression and multiple human pathogens utilize cd  for efficient infection cd  expression is so high in several cancers that it is now used as a prognostic marker the two primary isoforms of cd  that are related to cancer progression have been identified differing in their number of immunoglobulin ig like domains these include cd  ig  ig  which is ubiquitously expressed in most tissues and cd  ig  ig  ig  which is retinal specific and implicated in retinoblastoma however little is known in regard to the retinal specific cd  ig domain despite its potential role in retinoblastoma we present the first crystal structure of the human cd  ig domain and show that the cd  ig domain is a crystallographic dimer with an i type domain structure which maintained in solution furthermore we have utilized our structural data together with mutagenesis to probe the biological activity of cd  containing proteins both with and without the cd  ig domain within several model cell lines our findings reveal that the cd  ig domain is a potent stimulator of interleukin  and suggest that the cd  ig domain has its own receptor distinct from that of the other cd  ig like domains cd  ig  ig  finally we show that the cd  ig dimer is the functional unit required for activity and can be disrupted by a single point mutation
