quantifying the similarities within fold space
we have used grath a graph based structure comparison algorithm to map the similarities between the different folds observed in the cath domain structure database statistical analysis of the distributions of the fold similarities has allowed us to assess the significance for any similarity therefore we have examined whether it is best to represent folds as discrete entities or whether in fact a more accurate model would be a continuum wherein folds overlap via common motifs to do this we have introduced a new statistical measure of fold similarity termed gregariousness for a particular fold gregariousness measures how many other folds have a significant structural overlap with that fold typically comprising   or more of the larger structure gregarious folds often contain commonly occurring super secondary structural motifs such as  meanders greek keys     plait motifs or  hairpins which are matching similar motifs in other folds apart from one example all the most gregarious folds matching   or more of the other folds in the database are     proteins they also occur in highly populated architectural regions of fold space adopting sandwich like arrangements containing two or more layers of  helices and  strands domains that exhibit a low gregariousness are those that have very distinctive folds with few common motifs or motifs that are packed in unusual arrangements most of the superhelices exhibit low gregariousness despite containing some commonly occurring super secondary structural motifs in these folds these common motifs are combined in an unusual way and represent a small proportion of the fold  lt    our results suggest that fold space may be considered as continuous for some architectural arrangements e g     sandwiches  in that super secondary motifs can be used to link neighbouring fold groups however in other regions of fold space much more discrete topologies are observed with little similarity between folds
