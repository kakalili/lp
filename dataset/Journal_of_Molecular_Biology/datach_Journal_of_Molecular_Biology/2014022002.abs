organization of dna partners and strand exchange mechanisms during flp site specific recombination analyzed by difference topology single molecule fret and single molecule tpm
flp site specific recombination between two target sites frts harboring non homology within the strand exchange region does not yield stable recombinant products in negatively supercoiled plasmids containing head to tail sites the reaction produces a series of knots with odd numbered crossings when the sites are in head to head orientation the knot products contain even numbered crossings both types of knots retain parental dna configuration by carrying out flp recombination after first assembling the topologically well defined tn resolvase synapse it is possible to determine whether these knots arise by a processive or a dissociative mechanism the nearly exclusive products from head to head and head to tail oriented  non homologous  frt partners are a  noded knot and a  noded knot respectively the corresponding products from a pair of native homologous frt sites are a  noded knot and a  noded catenane respectively these results are consistent with non homology induced two rounds of dissociative recombination by flp the first to generate reciprocal recombinants containing non complementary base pairs and the second to produce parental molecules with restored base pairing single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer smfret analysis of geometrically restricted frts together with single molecule tethered particle motion smtpm assays of unconstrained frts suggests that the sites are preferentially synapsed in an anti parallel fashion this selectivity in synapse geometry occurs prior to the chemical steps of recombination signifying early commitment to a productive reaction path the cumulative topological smfret and smtpm results have implications for the relative orientation of dna partners and the directionality of strand exchange during recombination mediated by tyrosine site specific recombinases
