high affinity amphipathic modulators of amyloid fibril nucleation and elongation
the misfolding and aggregation of proteins to form amyloid fibrils are associated with a number of debilitating age related diseases many of the proteins that form amyloid in vivo are lipid binding proteins accounting for the significant impact of lipids on the rate of formation and morphology of amyloid fibrils to systematically investigate the effect of lipid like compounds we screened a range of amphipathic lipids and detergents for their effect on amyloid fibril formation by human apolipoprotein apo c ii the initial screen conducted using a set of amphiphiles at half critical micelle concentration identified several activators and inhibitors that were selected for further analysis sedimentation analysis and circular dichroism studies of apoc ii at low non fibril forming concentrations    mg ml revealed that all of the inhibitors induced the formation of apoc ii dimers enriched in  helical content while the activators promoted the formation of stable apoc ii tetramers with increased  structure kinetic analysis identified modulators of apoc ii fibril formation that were effective at concentrations as low as    m corresponding to a modulator to apoc ii ratio of approximately    delayed addition of the test compounds after fibril formation had commenced allowed the effects of selected amphiphiles on fibril elongation to be determined separately from their effects on fibril nucleation the results indicated that specific amphiphiles induce structural changes in apoc ii that cause separate and independent effects on fibril nucleation and elongation low molecular weight amphipathic lipids and detergents may serve as useful stage specific modulators of protein self assembly and fibril formation in disease prevention strategies
