many local motions cooperate to produce the adenylate kinase conformational transition
conformational transitions are functionally important in many proteins in the enzyme adenylate kinase ak  two small domains lid and nmp close over the larger core domain the reverse opening motion limits the rate of catalytic turnover here using double well g  simulations of escherichia coli ak we elaborate on previous investigations of the ak transition mechanism by characterizing the contributions of rigid body cartesian  backbone dihedral and contact motions to transition state ts properties in addition we compare an apo simulation to a pseudo ligand bound simulation to reveal insights into allostery in cartesian space lid closure precedes nmp closure in the bound simulation consistent with prior coarse grained models of the ak transition however nmp first closure is preferred in the apo simulation in backbone dihedral space we find that as expected backbone fluctuations are reduced in the o c transition in parts of all three domains among these  quenching  residues most in the core especially residues     are rigidified in the ts of the bound simulation while residues     in the nmp are flexible in the ts in contact space in both apo and bound simulations one nucleus of closed state contacts includes parts of the nmp and core core  lid contacts are absent in the ts of the apo simulation but formed in the ts of the bound simulation from these results we predict mutations that will perturb the opening and or closing transition rates by changing the entropy of dihedrals and or the enthalpy of contacts furthermore regarding allostery the fully closed structure is populated in the apo simulation but our contact results imply that ligand binding shifts the preferred o c transition pathway thus precluding a simple conformational selection mechanism finally the analytical approach and the insights derived from this work may inform the rational design of flexibility and allostery in proteins
