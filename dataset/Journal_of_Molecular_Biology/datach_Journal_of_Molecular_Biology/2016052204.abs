structural basis for translation termination on a pseudouridylated stop codon
pseudouridylation of messenger rna emerges as an abundant modification involved in gene expression regulation pseudouridylation of stop codons in eukaryotic and bacterial cells results in stop codon read through the structural mechanism of this phenomenon is not known here we present a    crystal structure of escherichia coli release factor  rf  bound to the  s ribosome in response to the  aa codon the structure reveals that recognition of a modified stop codon does not differ from that of a canonical stop codon our in vitro biochemical results support this finding by yielding nearly identical rates for peptide release from e coli ribosomes programmed with pseudouridylated and canonical stop codons the crystal structure also brings insight into e coli rf specific interactions and suggests involvement of l  in bacterial translation termination our results are consistent with a mechanism in which read through of a pseudouridylated stop codon in bacteria results from increased decoding by near cognate trnas miscoding rather than from decreased efficiency of termination
