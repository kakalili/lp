human immunodeficiency virus type  neutralizing monoclonal antibody f is multispecific for sequences flanking the dkw core epitope
human monoclonal antibody f is one of a few human antibodies that neutralize a broad range of hiv  primary isolates the f epitope on gp  includes the sequence eldkwa with the core residues dkw being critical for antibody binding hiv neutralizing antibodies have never been elicited by immunization with peptides bearing eldkwa suggesting that important part s of the f paratope remain unidentified the use of longer peptides extending beyond eldkwa has resulted in increased epitope antigenicity but neutralizing antibodies have not been generated we sought to develop peptides that bind to f  and that function as specific probes of the f paratope thus we used f to screen a set of phage displayed random peptide libraries tight binding clones from the random peptide libraries displayed sequence variability in the regions flanking the dkw motif to further reveal flanking regions involved in f binding two semi defined libraries were constructed having  variegated residues either n terminal or c terminal to the dkw core x  aadkw and aadkw x  respectively  three clones isolated from the aadkw x  library had similar high affinities despite a lack of sequence homology among them or with gp  the contribution of each residue of these clones to f binding was evaluated by ala substitution and amino acid deletion studies and revealed that each clone bound f by a different mechanism these results suggest that the f paratope is formed by at least two functionally distinct regions one that displays specificity for the dkw core epitope and another that is multispecific for sequences c terminal to the core epitope the implications of this second multispecific region of the f paratope for its unique biological function are discussed
