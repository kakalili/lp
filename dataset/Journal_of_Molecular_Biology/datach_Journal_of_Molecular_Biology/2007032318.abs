interaction of discoidin domain receptor  with collagen type
discoidin domain receptor  ddr  is a widely expressed tyrosine kinase receptor which binds to and gets activated by collagens including collagen type  little is understood about the interaction of ddr with collagen and its possible functional implications here we elucidate the binding pattern of the ddr extracellular domain ecd to collagen type  and its impact on collagen fibrillogenesis our in vitro assays utilized ddr fc fusion proteins which contain only the ecd of ddr  using surface plasmon resonance we confirmed that further oligomerization of ddr fc by means of anti fc antibody greatly enhances its binding to immobilized collagen type  single molecule imaging by means of atomic force microscopy revealed that ddr oligomers bound at overlapping or adjacent collagen molecules and were nearly absent on isolated collagen molecules interaction of ddr oligomers with collagen was found to modulate collagen fibrillogenesis both in vitro and in cell based assays collagen fibers formed in the presence of ddr had a larger average diameter were more cross linked and lacked the native banded structure the presence of ddr ecd resulted in  locking  of collagen molecules in an incomplete fibrillar state both in vitro and on surfaces of cells overexpressing ddr  our results signify an important functional role of the ddr ecd which occurs naturally in kinase dead isoforms of ddr and as a shedded soluble protein the modulation of collagen fibrillogenesis by the ddr ecd elucidates a novel mechanism of collagen regulation by ddr
