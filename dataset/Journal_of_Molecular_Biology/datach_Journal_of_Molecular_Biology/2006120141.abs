pcna activates the holliday junction endonuclease hjc
the resolving enzyme hjc which cleaves holliday junctions with a high degree of structural specificity is conserved in all archaea like ruvc in escherichia coli hjc functions in the related processes of homologous recombination and double strand break repair in bacteria the ruvab complex binds holliday junctions and catalyses atp dependent branch migration but the equivalent proteins in archaea and eukarya are unknown here we demonstrate that hjc from sulfolobus solfataricus forms a physical interaction with the sliding clamp pcna via a c terminal pcna interacting peptide pip motif in hjc pcna stimulates the holliday junction cleavage activity of hjc in vitro and deletion of the pip motif abrogates this effect this is the first report of a functional interaction between a sliding clamp and a junction resolving enzyme and raises the possibility that pcna could recruit a variety of different proteins to act on holliday junctions in vivo
