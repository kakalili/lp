a template rna entry channel in the fingers domain of the poliovirus polymerase
positive strand rna viruses within the picornaviridae family express an rna dependent rna polymerase  dpol that is required for viral rna replication structures of dpol from poliovirus coxsackievirus human rhinoviruses and other picornaviruses reveal a putative template rna entry channel on the surface of the enzyme fingers domain basic amino acids and tyrosine residues along this entry channel are predicted to form ionic and base stacking interactions with the viral rna template as it enters the polymerase active site we generated a series of alanine substitution mutations at these residues in the poliovirus polymerase and assayed their effects on template rna binding rna synthesis initiation rates of rna elongation elongation complex ec stability and virus growth the results show that basic residues k   r   and r  are important for template rna binding while tyrosines y  and y  are required for efficient initiation of rna synthesis and for ec stability alanine substitutions of tyrosines   and   at the tip of the dpol pinky finger drastically decreased the rate of initiation as well as ec stability but without affecting template rna binding or rna elongation rates viable poliovirus was recovered from hela cells transfected with mutant rnas however mutations that dramatically inhibited template rna binding k  a k  a and r  a  rna synthesis initiation y  a y  a  or ec stability y  a y  a were not stably maintained in progeny virus these data identify key residues within the template rna entry channel and begin to define their distinct mechanistic roles within rna ecs
