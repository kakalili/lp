cofilin adf affects lateral contacts in f actin
the effect of yeast cofilin on lateral contacts between protomers of yeast and skeletal muscle actin filaments was examined in solution these contacts are presumably stabilized by the interactions of loop     of one protomer with two other protomers on the opposite strand in f actin cofilin inhibited several fold the rate of interstrand disulfide cross linking between cys  and cys  in yeast s  c mutant f actin but enhanced excimer formation between pyrene probes attached to these cysteine residues the possibility that these effects are due to a translocation of the c terminus of actin by cofilin was ruled out by measurements of fluorescence resonance energy transfer fret from tryptophan residues and  atp to acceptor probes at cys   such measurements did not reveal cofilin induced changes in fret efficiency suggesting that changes in cys  cys  cross linking and excimer formation stem from the perturbation of loop     by cofilin changes in lateral interactions in f actin were indicated also by the cofilin induced partial release of rhodamine phalloidin disulfide cross linking of s  c yeast f actin inhibited strongly and reversibly the release of rhodamine phalloidin by cofilin overall this study provides solution evidence for the weakening of lateral interactions in f actin by cofilin
