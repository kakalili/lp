hsfs stress sensors and sculptors of transcription compartments and epigenetic landscapes
starting as a paradigm for stress responses the study of the transcription factor tf family of heat shock factors hsfs has quickly and widely expanded these last decades thanks to their fascinating and significant involvement in a variety of pathophysiological processes including development reproduction neurodegeneration and carcinogenesis hsfs originally defined as classical tfs strikingly appeared to play a central and often pioneering role in reshaping the epigenetic landscape in this review we describe how hsfs are able to sense the epigenetic environment and we review recent data that support their role as sculptors of the chromatin landscape through their complex interplay with chromatin remodelers histone modifying enzymes and non coding rnas
