heterosubunit composition and crystal structures of a novel bacterial m b metallopeptidase
three subfamilies of metallopeptidase family m  enzymes  m a m b and m c  are widely distributed among eukaryotes and prokaryotes sph   a periplasmic m b protein found in sphingomonas sp strain a  contains an hxxeh motif essential for zn  binding and catalytic activity sph   is another member of m b which lacks the metal binding motif but conserves an active site r y pair commonly found in the c terminal half of m  enzymes two genes coding for sph   and sph   assemble into a single operon in the bacterial genome this study determined sph   to be constitutively expressed in strain a cells grown on different carbon sources suggesting a more general cellular function sph   and sph   sph   were overexpressed in escherichia coli purified and characterized sph   was found to associate with sph   forming a heterosubunit enzyme with peptidase activity while sph   alone exhibited no enzymatic activity x ray crystallography of the sph   sph   complex revealed two conformations open and closed heterodimeric forms within the same crystal compared with the closed form the open form contains two subunits rotated away from each other by approximately   increasing the distance between the zinc ion and active site residues by up to    in addition many hydrogen bonds are formed or broken on change between the conformations of the heterodimers suggesting that subunit dynamics is a prerequisite for catalysis to our knowledge this is the first report on both conformational forms of the same m  peptidase providing a unique insight into the general proteolytic mechanism of m  proteases
