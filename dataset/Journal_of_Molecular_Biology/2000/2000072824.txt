Tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR-1) death domain (DD) is the intracellular functional domain responsible for the receptor signaling activities. To understand the transduction mechanism of TNFR-1 signaling we performed structural and functional analysis of the TNFR-DD. The secondary structure of the TNFR-DD shows that it consists of six anti-parallel Î±-helices. The determination of the topological fold and an extensive mutagenesis analysis revealed that there are two opposite faces that are involved in self-association and interaction with the TRADD death domain. Interestingly, the same critical residues in TNFR-DD are involved in both interactions. There is a good correlation between the binding activities of the mutant proteins and their cytotoxic activities. These results provide important insight into the molecular interactions mediating TNFR-DD self-association and subsequent recruitment of TRADD in the signaling activity of TNFR-1.
