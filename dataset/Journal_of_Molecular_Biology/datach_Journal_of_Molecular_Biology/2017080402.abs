hiv  sequence necessary and sufficient to package non viral rnas into hiv  particles
genome packaging is an essential step to generate infectious hiv  virions and is mediated by interactions between the viral protein gag and cis acting elements in the full length rna the sequence necessary and sufficient to allow rna genome packaging into an hiv  particle has not been defined here we used two distinct reporter systems to determine the hiv  sequence required for heterologous non viral rnas to be packaged into viral particles although the   untranslated region utr of the hiv  rna is known to be important for rna packaging we found that its ability to mediate packaging relies heavily on the context of the downstream sequences insertion of the   utr and the first  nt of gag into two different reporter rnas is not sufficient to mediate the packaging of these rna into hiv  particles however adding the   half of the gag gene to the   utr strongly facilitates the packaging of two reporter rnas such rnas can be packaged at gt   of the efficiencies of an hiv  near full length vector to further examine the role of the gag sequence in rna packaging we replaced the   gag sequence in the hiv  genome with two codon optimized gag sequences and found that such substitutions only resulted in a moderate decrease of rna packaging efficiencies taken together these results indicated that both hiv    utr and the   gag sequence are required for efficient packaging of non viral rna into hiv  particles although the gag sequence likely plays an indirect role in genome packaging
