murf dependent regulation of systemic carbohydrate metabolism as revealed from transgenic mouse studies
under various pathophysiological muscle wasting conditions such as diabetes and starvation a family of ubiquitin ligases including muscle specific ring finger protein  murf  are induced to target muscle proteins for degradation via ubiquitination we have generated transgenic mouse lines over expressing murf in a skeletal muscle specific fashion murf tg mice in an attempt to identify the in vivo targets of murf  murf tg lines were viable had normal fertility and normal muscle weights at eight weeks of age comparison of quadriceps from murf tg and wild type mice did not reveal elevated multi ubiquitination of myosin as observed in human patients with muscle wasting instead murf tg mice expressed lower levels of pyruvate dehydrogenase pdh  a mitochondrial key enzyme in charge of glycolysis and of its regulator pdk  furthermore yeast two hybrid interaction studies demonstrated the interaction of murf with pdh pdk  pdk  pkm  all participating in glycolysis and with phosphorylase   pygm and glycogenin both regulating glycogen metabolism  consistent with the idea that murf may regulate carbohydrate metabolism murf tg mice had twofold elevated insulin blood levels and lower hepatic glycogen contents to further examine murf s role for systemic carbohydrate regulation we performed glucose tolerance tests gtt in wild type and murf tg mice during gtt murf tg mice developed striking hyperinsulinaemia and hepatic glycogen stores that were depleted at basal levels became rapidly replenished taken together our data demonstrate that murf expression in skeletal muscle re directs glycogen synthesis to the liver and stimulates pancreatic insulin secretion thereby providing a regulatory feedback loop that connects skeletal muscle metabolism with the liver and the pancreas during metabolic stress
