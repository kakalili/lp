structural insights of whamm s interaction with microtubules by cryo em
wasp homolog associated with actin membranes and microtubules whamm is a vertebrate protein functioning in membrane tubulation for intracellular membrane trafficking and specific organelle formation composed of multiple domains whamm can bind to membrane and microtubule mt and promote actin polymerization nucleation previous work revealed that whamm s activity to promote actin nucleation is repressed upon binding to mts here we discovered that whamm interacts with   tubulin through a small peptide motif within its mt binding domain we reconstructed a high resolution structure of whamm s mt binding motif mbm assembling around mts using cryo electron microscopy and verified it with chemical cross linking and mass spectrometry analysis we also detected a conformational switch of this motif between the non mt bound state and the mt bound state these discoveries provide new insights into the mechanism by which whamm coordinates actin and mt networks the two major cytoskeletal systems involved in membrane trafficking and membrane remodeling
