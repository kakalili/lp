pre steady state kinetic analysis of the elongation of amyloid fibrils of   microglobulin with tryptophan mutagenesis
amyloid fibrils elongate seed dependently with preformed fibrils providing a template for propagation of amyloidogenic conformation most seeding experiments use relatively few seed fibrils in comparison with monomers resembling steady state enzyme kinetics pre steady state kinetics should also be useful for characterizing the elongation process with   microglobulin   m  a protein responsible for dialysis related amyloidosis we measured the pre steady state kinetics of fibril elongation at ph    conditions under which the monomer is largely unfolded   m has trp residues at positions  and   we used three single trp mutants and fluorescence spectroscopy to study structural change upon fibril elongation to focus on conformational change in monomers we prepared seeds with a mutant without a trp residue at a fixed concentration of monomeric   m the apparent rate of fibril elongation increased with an increase in the concentration of seeds and then saturated suggesting the accumulation of a rate limiting intermediate importantly saturation occurred at a seed monomer ratio of around   as expressed by the concentration of the monomer because the number of monomers constituting the seed fibrils is much larger than   the results suggest that the elongation process is limited by  non active site binding   spectral analysis indicated that upon this non active site binding both trp  and trp  are exposed to the solvent and then only trp  is buried upon transition to the fibrils we propose a new model of fibril elongation in which non active site binding plays a major role
