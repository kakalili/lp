structural bioinformatic and in vivo analyses of two treponema pallidum lipoproteins reveal a unique trap transporter
treponema pallidum the bacterial agent of syphilis is predicted to encode one tripartite atp independent periplasmic transporter trap t  trap ts typically employ a periplasmic substrate binding protein sbp to deliver the cognate ligand to the transmembrane symporter herein we demonstrate that the genes encoding the putative trap t components from t pallidum tp   the sbp  and tp   the symporter  are in an operon with an uncharacterized third gene tp   we determined the crystal structure of recombinant tp   the protein is trimeric and perforated by a pore part of tp   forms an assembly similar to those of  tetratricopeptide repeat   tpr motifs the crystal structure of recombinant tp   was also determined like the sbps of other trap ts there are two lobes separated by a cleft in these other sbps the cleft binds a negatively charged ligand however the cleft of tp   has a strikingly hydrophobic chemical composition indicating that its ligand may be substantially different and likely hydrophobic analytical ultracentrifugation of the recombinant versions of tp   and tp   established that these proteins associate avidly this unprecedented interaction was confirmed for the native molecules using in vivo cross linking experiments finally bioinformatic analyses suggested that this transporter exemplifies a new subfamily of tpats tpr protein associated trap ts that require the action of a tpr containing accessory protein for the periplasmic transport of a potentially hydrophobic ligand s
