the inhibitory effect of the autoantigen la on in vitro   processing of mammalian precursor trnas edited by m belfort
mammalian trna   processing endoribonuclease    trnase can remove a   trailer from various precursor pre trnas we investigated what effect the autoantigen la has on   processing since the la protein is known to bind to a   terminal uridine tract of pre trnas we tested sixteen different pre trnaarg substrates containing various   trailers with or without a   leader sequence for in vitro processing by pig   trnase and for gel retardation in the presence or absence of human la protein the r tuuu series consists of four pre trnas containing     and  nt   trailers ending with uuu and no   leader while the r tagc series consists of the same four pre trnas as r tuuu except that the terminal sequence is agc the r ltuuu and r ltagc series are derived from r tuuu and r tagc respectively by adding a  nt   leader la differentially inhibited their processing and bound to the pre trnas the   inhibitory concentrations for the r tuuu r tagc r ltuuu and r ltagc series were  to gt    gt    to   and   to   nm respectively and the dissociation constants were  to    gt    to   and   to   nm respectively these results indicate that both the terminal sequence uuu and the   leader contribute to more severe inhibition of   processing via tighter interaction with la with respect to the r tuuu and r ltuuu series on the whole the la inhibition was enhanced as the   trailer lengths decreased taken together our results suggest that the la protein sterically hinders   trnase from binding a pre trna molecule probably near the cleavage site
