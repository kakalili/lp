c h   interactions in proteins
a non redundant set of   protein structures from the protein data bank was examined with respect to close interactions between c h donor and  acceptor groups a total of    interactions were found to satisfy our selection criteria their geometric parameters suggest that these interactions can be classified as weak hydrogen bonds a set of  interaction classes were defined based on the division of the donors into three groups and the acceptors into four groups these classes were examined separately and the respective interactions described in detail in each class most prominent were interactions between aliphatic c h donors and aromatic  acceptors and interactions between aromatic c h donors and aromatic  acceptors about three quarters of the trp rings half of all phe and tyr rings and a quarter of all his rings were found to be involved as acceptors in c h   interactions on the donor side a preference for aromatic c h groups was observed but also for the aliphatic side chains of the long extended amino acid residues lys arg and met and the pro ring the average distance between the c donor and the center of mass of the  acceptor was observed to be significantly longer in the   protein structures determined at gt    resolution also the distribution is significantly wider this resolution dependance suggests that the force fields commonly used for the refinement of protein structures may not be adequate c h   interactions involving aromatic groups either as donor or as acceptor groups are found mostly in the interior of the protein the more hydrophilic the participating groups are the closer to the surface are the interactions located about   of all c h   interactions occur between amino acid residue side chains that are separated by nine or less residues in sequence dependent on the interaction class different preferences for secondary structure residue type and side chain conformation were observed it is likely that the c h   interactions contribute significantly to the overall stability of a protein
