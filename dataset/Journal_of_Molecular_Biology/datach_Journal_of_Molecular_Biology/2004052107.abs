polarity effects in the lactose operon of escherichia coli
an intergenic rna segment between lacy and laca of the lactose operon in escherichia coli is cleaved by rnase p an endoribonuclease the cleavage of the intergenic rna was ten times less efficient than cleavage of a trna precursor in vitro fragments of the rnase p cleavage product are detectable in vivo in the wild type strain but not in a mutant strain at the restrictive temperature the cleavage product that contains laca in the wild type strain was quickly degraded when this intergenic segment was cloned upstream of a reporter gene the expression of the reporter gene was also inhibited substantially in wild type e coli but not in a temperature sensitive mutant strain in rnase p at the restrictive temperature these results support data regarding the natural polarity between lacz versus laca the downstream gene
