differential melting of the transcription start site associated with changes in rna polymerase promoter contacts in initiating transcription complexes edited by m yaniv
formaldehyde cross linking was used in a kinetic analysis of rna polymerase lac uv promoter interactions in open complexes rpo  rpo quenched from   c to   c isomerised to a closed competitor resistant complex rplt  we observed that contacts of the    and  subunits with the positions      of the non template dna strand disappeared very quickly during the first  seconds after the temperature downshift the re annealing of the dna downstream of the transcription start site takes place in the same time scale however re annealing of the upstream part of the transcription bubble was slower and completed within five minutes the results support a two step model of promoter melting and suggest that conformational changes in the rna polymerase occur concurrently with the melting around the transcription start site
