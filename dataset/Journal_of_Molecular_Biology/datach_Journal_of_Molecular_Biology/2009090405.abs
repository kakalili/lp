functional importance of bacteriophage   dna polymerase residue tyr  in primer terminus stabilisation at the      exonuclease active site
recent crystallographic resolution of   dna polymerase complexes with ssdna at its      exonuclease active site has allowed the identification of residues pro  and tyr  as putative ssdna ligands the latter being conserved in the kx h motif of proofreading family b dna polymerases single substitution of   dna polymerase residue tyr  to ala rendered an enzyme with a reduced capacity to stabilize the binding of the primer terminus at the      exonuclease active site not having a direct role in the catalysis of the reaction analysis of the      exonuclease on primer template structures showed a critical role for residue tyr  in the proofreading of dna polymerisation errors in addition tyr  is not involved in coupling polymerisation to strand displacement in contrast to the catalytic residues responsible for the exonuclease reaction its role being restricted to stabilisation of the frayed   terminus at the exonuclease active site altogether the results lead us to extend the consensus sequence of the above motif of proofreading family b dna polymerases into kx hxa the different solutions adopted by proofreading dna polymerases to stack the   terminus at the exonuclease site are discussed in addition the results obtained with mutants at   dna polymerase residue pro  allow us to rule out a functional role as ssdna ligand for this residue
