structural basis of the preferential binding for globo series glycosphingolipids displayed by pseudomonas aeruginosa lectin i
the opportunistic pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa contains several carbohydrate binding proteins among which is the p aeruginosa lectin i pa il  which displays affinity for  galactosylated glycans glycan arrays were screened and demonstrated stronger binding of pa il toward  gal    gal terminating structures and weaker binding to  gal    gal ones in order to determine which human glycoconjugates could play a role in the carbohydrate mediated adhesion of the bacteria this was confirmed in vivo by testing the binding of the lectin to burkitt lymphoma cells that present large amounts of globotriaosylceramide antigen gb cd  pk trisaccharide moieties of gb   gal    gal   glc and isoglobotriaosylceramide  gal    gal   glc were tested by titration microcalorimetry and both displayed similar affinity to pa il in solution the crystal structure of pa il complexed to  gal    gal   glc trisaccharide has been solved at    resolution and revealed how the second galactose residue makes specific contacts with the protein surface molecular modeling studies were performed in order to compare the binding mode of pa il toward  gal   gal with that toward  gal   gal docking studies demonstrated that  gal   gal creates another network of contacts for achieving a very similar affinity and  ns molecular dynamics in explicit water allowed for analyzing the flexibility of each disaccharide ligand in the protein binding site the higher affinity observed for binding to gb epitope both in vivo and on glycan array is likely related to the presentation effect of the oligosaccharide on a surface since only the gb glycosphingolipid geometry is fully compatible with parallel insertion of neighboring trisaccharide heads in two binding sites of the same tetramer of pa il
