simultaneous and functional binding of smpb and ef tu gtp to the alanyl acceptor arm of tmrna  edited by j doudna
transfer messenger rna tmrna mimics functions of aminoacyl trna and mrna subsequently when rescuing stalled ribosomes on a   truncated mrna without stop codon in bacteria in addition this mechanism marks prematurely terminated proteins by a c terminal peptide tag as a signal for degradation by specific cellular proteases for escherichia coli previous studies on initial steps of this  trans translation  mechanism revealed that tmrna alanylation by ala trna synthetase and binding of ala tmrna by ef tu gtp for subsequent delivery to stalled ribosomes are inefficient when compared to analogous reactions with canonical trnaala in other studies protein smpb and ribosomal protein s appeared to bind directly to tmrna and to be indispensable for trans translation here we have searched for additional and synergistic effects of the latter two on tmrna alanylation and its subsequent binding to ef tu gtp kinetic analysis of functioning combined with band shift experiments and structural probing demonstrate that tmrna may indeed form a multimeric complex with smpb s and ef tu gtp which leads to a considerably enhanced efficiency of the initial steps of trans translation whereas s binds to the mrna region of tmrna we have found that smpb and ef tu both interact with its acceptor arm region interaction with smpb and ef tu was also observed at the acceptor arm of ala trnaala but there the alanylation efficiency was inhibited rather than stimulated by smpb therefore smpb may function as an essential modulator of the trna like acceptor arm of tmrna during its successive steps in trans translation
