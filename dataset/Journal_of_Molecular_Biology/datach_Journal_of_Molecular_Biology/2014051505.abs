sequence and membrane determinants of the random coil  helix transition of  synuclein
a random coil  helix transition underlies the association of the presynaptic protein  synuclein  s with curved vesicle membranes to fold asp  ala  into a continuous helix to clarify this transition we examined  s folding cooperativity helix nucleation and propagation in relation to membrane stabilization and leakage on diverse small unilamellar vesicles the sequences centering on phe and tyr  initiate lipid interactions and the phe region nucleates the helix irrespective of the order of ser  ala  however helix propagation is not the sum of individual  s  membrane interactions it requires non uniform but balanced sequence distributions of lipid affinities and helix flexibility the attained helix propagation like folding cooperativity depends distinctly on membrane lipid composition and correlates to the degree of  s conferred membrane stabilization contrary to classical coil  helix folding thermodynamics helix propagation proceeds with a small gain in free energy relative to helix nucleation indicating that its binding enthalpy is expended to compensate a high entropic cost of reducing lipid packing defects in the curved membrane non saturating lipid conditions or rigidification of the  s helix triggers an increase in small unilamellar vesicle membrane leakage thus  s folding parameters appear highly optimized and closely matched to stabilize and protect its target membrane aging associated changes in lipid and  s concentrations may therefore alter synaptic plasticity and contribute to  s misfolding that culminates in fatal neurodegeneration
