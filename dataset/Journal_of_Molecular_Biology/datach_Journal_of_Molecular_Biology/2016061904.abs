molecular mechanisms of transcription initiation  structure function and evolution of tfe tfiie like factors and open complex formation
transcription initiation requires that the promoter dna is melted and the template strand is loaded into the active site of the rna polymerase rnap  forming the open complex oc  the archaeal initiation factor tfe and its eukaryotic counterpart tfiie facilitate this process recent structural and biophysical studies have revealed the position of tfe tfiie within the pre initiation complex pic and illuminated its role in oc formation tfe operates via allosteric and direct mechanisms firstly it interacts with the rnap and induces the opening of the flexible rnap clamp domain concomitant with dna melting and template loading secondly tfe binds physically to single stranded dna in the transcription bubble of the oc and increases its stability the identification of the  subunit of archaeal tfe enabled us to reconstruct the evolutionary history of tfe tfiie like factors which is characterised by winged helix wh domain expansion in eukaryotes and loss of metal centres including iron sulfur clusters and zinc ribbons oc formation is an important target for the regulation of transcription in all domains of life we propose that tfe and the bacterial general transcription factor card although structurally and evolutionary unrelated show interesting parallels in their mechanism to enhance oc formation we argue that oc formation is used as a way to regulate transcription in all domains of life and these regulatory mechanisms coevolved with the basal transcription machinery
