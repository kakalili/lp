adenosine deaminase adar increases gene expression at the translational level by decreasing protein kinase pkr dependent eif   phosphorylation
adar  adenosine deaminase acting on rna catalyzes the deamination of adenosine to inosine on rna substrates with double stranded character here we show that coexpression of adar in mammalian cells markedly increases plasmid based gene expression in transfected cells the enhanced expression was independent of the nature of the promoter viral and cellular used to drive gene expression of the protein reporter luciferase and rrp tested and of the human cell line examined   t and hela  exogenous protein levels were increased by    fold to    fold when adar was coexpressed whereas rna transcript levels changed by less than  fold the activation of pkr protein kinase regulated by rna protein kinase and the phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eif   seen following plasmid dna transfection were both greatly reduced in adar transfected cells stable knockdown of the pkr kinase increased reporter gene expression in the absence but not in the presence of adar coexpression both size forms of adar  the p  inducible form and the p  like constitutive form  enhanced plasmid based gene expression taken together these results indicate that the adar deaminase increases exogenous gene expression at the translational level by decreasing pkr dependent eif   phosphorylation
