isolation of a human single chain antibody fragment against oligomeric  synuclein that inhibits aggregation and prevents  synuclein induced toxicity
protein misfolding and aggregation are pathological aspects of numerous neurodegenerative diseases aggregates of  synuclein are major components of the lewy bodies and lewy neurites associated with parkinson s disease pd  a natively unfolded protein   synuclein can adopt different aggregated morphologies including oligomers protofibrils and fibrils the small oligomeric aggregates have been shown to be particularly toxic antibodies that neutralize the neurotoxic aggregates without interfering with beneficial functions of monomeric  synuclein can be useful therapeutics we were able to isolate single chain antibody fragments scfvs from a phage displayed antibody library against the target antigen morphology using a novel biopanning technique that utilizes atomic force microscopy afm to image and immobilize specific morphologies of  synuclein the scfv described here binds only to an oligomeric form of  synuclein and inhibits both aggregation and toxicity of  synuclein in vitro this scfv can have potential therapeutic value in controlling misfolding and aggregation of  synuclein in vivo when expressed intracellularly in dopaminergic neurons as an intrabody
