geometric similarities of protein  protein interfaces at atomic resolution are only observed within homologous families an exhaustive structural classification study
to elucidate the structural basis of the diversity and universality in protein  protein interactions an exhaustive all against all structural comparison of all known protein interfaces in the protein data bank was performed at atomic resolution after similar interfaces were clustered approximately    structural motifs with at least two members were identified out of which   motifs consisted of at least  interfaces except for some trivial interfaces involving single  helices almost all motifs were found to be confined within single protein families furthermore the interaction partners of each motif were found to be very limited and accordingly the interaction networks of the motifs tend to be small and are much more restricted than the binding sites for small ligand molecules these findings suggest that at the level of atomic structures protein  protein interactions are precisely designed hence protein interfaces with multiple interacting partners should involve incompletely overlapping multiple interfaces and or accommodate structural changes upon binding to their targets
