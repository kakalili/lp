crystal structure of the apicoplast dna polymerase from plasmodium falciparum the first look at a plastidic a family dna polymerase
plasmodium falciparum the primary cause of malaria contains a non photosynthetic plastid called the apicoplast the apicoplast exists in most members of the phylum apicomplexa and has its own genome along with organelle specific enzymes for its replication the only dna polymerase found in the apicoplast appol was putatively acquired through horizontal gene transfer from a bacteriophage and is classified as an atypical a family polymerase here we present its crystal structure at a resolution of    p falciparum appol the first structural representative of a plastidic a family polymerase diverges from typical a family members in two of three previously identified signature motifs and in a region not implicated by sequence moreover appol has an additional n terminal subdomain the absence of which severely diminishes its   to   exonuclease activity a compound known to be toxic to plasmodium is a potent inhibitor of appol suggesting that appol is a viable drug target the structure provides new insights into the structural diversity of a family polymerases and may facilitate structurally guided antimalarial drug design
