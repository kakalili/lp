dlx homeodomain dna complex structure binding and effect of mutations related to split hand and foot malformation syndrome
the dlx homeodomain is a transcription factor related to the drosophila distal less gene that is associated with breast and lung cancer lymphoma rett syndrome and osteoporosis in humans mutations in the dlx gene have been linked to deficiencies in craniofacial and limb development in higher eukaryotes including split hand and foot malformation  in humans our characterization of a dlx homeodomain cgactaattagtcg  complex by nmr spectroscopy paved the way for determination of its crystal structure at    resolution that enabled rationalization of the effects of disease related mutations on the protein function a q  h mutation linked to split hand and foot malformation  likely affects affinity of dna binding by disrupting water mediated interactions with the dna major groove a more subtle effect is implicated for the q  p mutation which is not in direct contact with the dna our data indicate that these mutations diminish the ability of the dlx homeodomain to recognize and bind target dnas and they likely destabilize the formation of functional complexes
