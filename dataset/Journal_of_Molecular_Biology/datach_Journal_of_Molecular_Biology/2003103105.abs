a novel binding protein for a member of cyp  type cyclophilins n crassa cypbp  a growth and thiamine regulated protein homolog to yeast thi p
cyclophilins belong to the family of peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerases ppiases  which are ubiquitous and highly conserved enzymes capable of cis trans isomerizing xaa pro peptide bonds members of the cyp  type cyclophilins have originally been described as components of hormone receptor complexes here we describe nccyp  a cyp  ortholog from neurospora crassa its expression in escherichia coli and subsequent purification characterization of nccyp  reveals that it is a heat shock protein which is active as a cyclosporin a sensitive ppiase affinity chromatography using immobilized recombinant nccyp  yielded two major nccyp  binding proteins hsp  a hsp  ortholog from n crassa and cypbp  cypbp  has not been described in addition this is the first record describing an interaction between a member of cyp  type cyclophilins and of cypbp  type proteins respectively cypbp  expression is repressed by thiamine and in the stationary phase in n crassa cypbp  is present in different isoforms the expression of a cypbp  ortholog in yeast thi p is diminished in a mutant lacking one of the two cyp  orthologs cpr p  in addition the  cpr p deletion mutant shows a thiamine dependent growth defect we conclude that in yeast cpr p and thi p interact functionally
