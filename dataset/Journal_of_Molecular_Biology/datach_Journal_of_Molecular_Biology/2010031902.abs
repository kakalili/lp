crystal structure of mouse elf c terminal dna binding domain in complex with type ii tgf  receptor promoter dna
the ets family of transcription factors is composed of more than  members one of its members elf  is expressed in virtually all epithelial cells as well as in many tumors including breast tumors several studies observed that the promoter of the type ii tgf  receptor gene t r ii is strongly stimulated by elf via two adjacent elf binding sites the a site and the b site here we report the     resolution crystal structure of a mouse elf c terminal fragment containing the dna binding ets domain in complex with the b site of mouse type ii tgf  receptor promoter dna mt r iidna  elf contacts the core ggaa motif of the b site from a major groove similar to that of known ets proteins however unlike other ets proteins elf also contacts sequences of the a site from the minor groove of the dna dna binding experiments and cell based transcription studies indicate that minor groove interaction by arg  located in the ets domain is important for elf function equally interesting previous studies have shown that the c terminal region of elf  which flanks the ets domain is required for elf binding to dna in this study we determined that elf amino acid residues within this flanking region including trp   are important for the structural integrity of the protein as well as for the efl dna binding and transactivation activity
