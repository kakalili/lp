nick recognition by dna ligases edited by k nagai
phage t dna ligase seals nicked dna substrates and is a representative member of the atp dependent class of dna ligases although the catalytic mechanism of dna ligases has been delineated little is known about the nature of nick recognition by these enzymes here we show that t ligase discriminates at the nick binding step between nicks containing either a   phosphate or a   oh t ligase binds preferentially to phosphorylated nicks and catalyses the sealing reaction we also show using dna footprinting studies that t ligase binds asymmetrically to nicks as a monomer with the protein interface covering between  and  bp of dna based on molecular modelling studies we propose a structural model of the ligase dna complex consistent with these and other data using photo crosslinking and site directed mutagenesis we have identified two residues k  and k   critical for the transadenylation and nick sealing reactions sequence conservation and structural analysis supports the premise that these two lysine residues are critical for both nucleotide binding and dna nick recognition the implications of these results on the ligation mechanism are discussed
