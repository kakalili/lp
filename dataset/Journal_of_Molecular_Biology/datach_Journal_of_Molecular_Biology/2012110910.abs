crystal structure of the n terminal domain of nup  ranbp
key steps in mrna export are the nuclear assembly of messenger ribonucleoprotein particles mrnps  the translocation of mrnps through the nuclear pore complex npc  and the mrnp remodeling events at the cytoplasmic side of the npc nup  ranbp is a constituent of the cytoplasmic filaments of the npc specific to higher eukaryotes and provides a multitude of binding sites for the nucleocytoplasmic transport machinery here we present the crystal structure of the nup  n terminal domain ntd at    resolution the structure reveals an  helical domain that harbors three central tetratricopeptide repeats tprs  flanked on each side by an additional solvating amphipathic  helix overall the ntd adopts an unusual extended conformation that lacks the characteristic peptide binding groove observed in canonical tpr domains strikingly the vast majority of the ntd surface exhibits an evolutionarily conserved positive electrostatic potential and we demonstrate that the ntd possesses the capability to bind single stranded rna in solution together these data suggest that the ntd contributes to mrnp remodeling events at the cytoplasmic face of the npc
