structural details of hiv  recognition by the broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody f  epitope conformation antigen recognition loop mobility and anion binding site
f is a monoclonal antibody with potent and broadly neutralizing activity against hiv  it targets the membrane proximal external region mper of the gp  subunit of the envelope glycoprotein and interferes with the process of fusion between viral and host cell membranes this study presents eight f fab  crystal structures in complex with various gp  peptide epitopes these structures reveal several key features of this antibody  antigen interaction   whenever free of contacts caused by crystal artifacts the extended complementarity determining region h loop is mobile this is true for ligand free and epitope bound forms   the interaction between the antibody and the gp  eldkwa epitope core is absolutely critical and there are also close and specific contacts with residues located n terminal to the epitope core   residues located at the c terminus of the gp  eldkwa core do not interact as tightly with the antibody however in the presence of a larger peptide containing the gp  fusion peptide segment these residues adopt a conformation consistent with the start of an  helix   at high sulfate concentrations the electron density maps of f fab   peptide complexes contain a peak that may mark a binding site for phosphate groups of negatively charged lipid headgroups the refined atomic level details of f paratope  epitope interactions revealed here should contribute to a better understanding of the mechanism of f based virus neutralization in general and prove important for the design of potential vaccine candidates intended to elicit f like antibody production
