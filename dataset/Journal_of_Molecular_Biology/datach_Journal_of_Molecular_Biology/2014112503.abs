a perspective on the complexity of dietary fiber structures and their potential effect on the gut microbiota
even though there are many factors that determine the human colon microbiota composition diet is an important one because most microorganisms in the colon obtain energy for their growth by degrading complex dietary compounds particularly dietary fibers while fiber carbohydrates that escape digestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract are recognized to have a range of structures the vastness in number of chemical structures from the perspective of the bacteria is not well appreciated in this article we introduce the concept of  discrete structure  that is defined as a unique chemical structure often within a fiber molecule which aligns with encoded gene clusters in bacterial genomes the multitude of discrete structures originates from the array of different fiber types coupled with structural variations within types due to genotype and growing environment anatomical parts of the grain or plant discrete regions within polymers and size of oligosaccharides and small polysaccharides these thousands of discrete structures conceivably could be used to favor bacteria in the competitive colon environment a global framework needs to be developed to better understand how dietary fibers can be used to obtain predicted changes in microbiota composition for improved health this will require a multi disciplinary effort that includes biological scientists clinicians and carbohydrate specialists
