transactivation of involucrin a marker of differentiation in keratinocytes by lens epithelium derived growth factor ledgf
human involucrin hinv  first appears in the cytosol of keratinocytes and ultimately cross linked to membrane proteins via transglutaminase and forms a protective barrier as an insoluble envelope beneath the plasma membrane although the function and evolution of involucrin is known the regulation of its gene expression is not well understood an analysis of the hinv gene sequence upstream of the transcription start site     to  nt revealed the presence of potential sites for binding of lens epithelium derived growth factor ledgf  stress response element stre a tgggga t and heat shock element hse ngaan  we reported earlier that ledgf activates stress associated genes by binding to these elements and elevates cellular resistance to various stresses here gel shift and super shift assays confirm the binding of ledgf to the dna fragments containing hses and stres that are present in the involucrin gene promoter furthermore hinv promoter linked to cat reporter gene cotransfected in human corneal simian virus  transformed keratinocytes hck  was transactivated by ledgf significantly in contrast the activity of hinv promoter bearing mutations at the wt  containing hse and stre  wt  containing stre and wt  containing stre binding sites was diminished in addition in hck cell over expressing ledgf the levels of hinv mrna and hinv protein are increased by four to five fold ledgf is inducible to oxidants cells treated with  o tetradecanoyl phorbol  acetate tpa  known to stimulate production of h o  showed higher levels of ledgf mrna furthermore our immunohistochemical studies revealed that hinv protein is found in the cytoplasm of hck cells over expressing ledgf but not detectable in the normal hck cells or hck cells transfected with vector this regulation appears to be physiologically important as over expression of hck with ledgf increases the expression of the endogenous hinv gene and may provide new insight to understand the molecular mechanism of transcriptional regulation of this gene ledgf may play an important role in establishing an important barrier in corneal keratinocytes by maintaining epidermal turn over rate and protecting hcks against stress
