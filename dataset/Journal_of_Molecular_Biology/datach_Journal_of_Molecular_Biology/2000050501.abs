color coding reveals tandem repeats in the escherichia coli genome edited by j h miller
genomic dna contains a wide variety of repetitive sequences in escherichia coli there have been several classes of repetitive sequences reported some of which cluster as tandem repeats we propose a novel method for analyzing symbolic sequences by two dimensional pattern formation with color coding we applied this method for searching tandem repeats in the e coli genome and found approximately  repeats with periods longer than  bases the longest repeat has a period of   bases
