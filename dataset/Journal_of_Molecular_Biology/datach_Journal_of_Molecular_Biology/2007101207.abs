structural basis for ubiquitin recognition by sh domains
the sh domain is a protein  protein interaction module commonly found in intracellular signaling and adaptor proteins the sh domains of multiple endocytic proteins have been recently implicated in binding ubiquitin which serves as a signal for diverse cellular processes including gene regulation endosomal sorting and protein destruction here we describe the solution nmr structure of ubiquitin in complex with an sh domain belonging to the yeast endocytic protein sla  the ubiquitin binding surface of the sla sh domain overlaps substantially with the canonical binding surface for proline rich ligands like many other ubiquitin binding motifs the sh domain engages the ile  hydrophobic patch of ubiquitin a phenylalanine residue located at the heart of the ubiquitin binding surface of the sh domain serves as a key specificity determinant the structure of the sh  ubiquitin complex explains how a subset of sh domains has acquired this non traditional function
