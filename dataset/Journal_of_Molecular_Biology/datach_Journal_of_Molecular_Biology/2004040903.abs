crystal structure of a dimeric oxidized form of human peroxiredoxin
peroxiredoxin  is the last discovered mammalian member of an ubiquitous family of peroxidases widely distributed among prokaryotes and eukaryotes mammalian peroxiredoxin  has been recently classified as an atypical  cys peroxiredoxin due to the presence of a conserved peroxidatic n terminal cysteine cys  and an unconserved resolving c terminal cysteine residue cys   forming an intramolecular disulfide intermediate in the oxidized enzyme we have recently reported the crystal structure of human peroxiredoxin  in its reduced form here a new crystal form of human peroxiredoxin  is described at    resolution the asymmetric unit contains three polypeptide chains surprisingly beside two reduced chains the third one is oxidized although the enzyme was crystallized under initial reducing conditions in the presence of  mm   dithio dl threitol the oxidized polypeptide chain forms an homodimer with a symmetry related one through intermolecular disulfide bonds between cys  and cys   the formation of these disulfide bonds is accompanied by the partial unwinding of the n terminal parts of the   helix which in the reduced form contains the peroxidatic cys  and the   helix which is sequentially close to the resolving residue cys   in each monomer of the oxidized chain the c terminal part including the   helix is completely reorganized and is isolated from the rest of the protein on an extended arm in the oxidized dimer the arm belonging to the first monomer now appears at the surface of the second subunit and vice versa
