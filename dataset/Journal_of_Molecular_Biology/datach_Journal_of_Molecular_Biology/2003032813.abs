structure and ligand binding of carbohydrate binding module cscbm  reveals similarities with fucose specific lectins and  galactose binding  domains
carbohydrate binding polypeptides including carbohydrate binding modules cbms from polysaccharidases and lectins are widespread in nature whilst cbms are classically considered distinct from lectins in that they are found appended to polysaccharide degrading enzymes this distinction is blurring the crystal structure of cscbm   a  sequence family   cbm in a xylanase from clostridium stercorarium at    reveals a similar all  sheet fold to that from mvx  a module found in a family  glycoside hydrolase sialidase from micromonospora viridifaciens and the lectin aaa from anguilla anguilla sequence analysis leads to the classification of mvx  and aaa into a family distinct from that containing cscbm   whilst these polypeptides are similar in structure they have quite different carbohydrate binding specificities aaa is known to bind fucose cscbm  binds cellulose xylan and other  glucans here we demonstrate that mvx  binds galactose lactose and sialic acid crystal structures of cscbm  in complex with xylotriose cellobiose and laminaribiose         and    resolution respectively reveal that the binding site of cscbm  resides on the same polypeptide face as for mvx  and aaa subtle differences in the ligand binding surface give rise to the different specificities and biological activities further blurring the distinction between classical lectins and cbms
