a key hydrophobic patch identified in an aaa protein essential for its in trans inhibitory regulation
bacterial enhancer binding proteins bebps are a subclass of the aaa  atpases associated with various cellular activities protein family they are responsible for   dependent transcription activation during infection and function under many stressful growth conditions the majority of bebps are regulated in their formation of ring shaped hexameric self assemblies via an amino terminal domain through its phosphorylation or ligand binding in contrast the escherichia coli phage shock protein f pspf is negatively regulated in trans by phage shock protein a pspa  up to six pspa subunits suppress pspf hexamer action here we present biochemical evidence that pspa engages across the side of a pspf hexameric ring we identify three key binding determinants located in a surface exposed  w  loop  of pspf which form a tightly packed hydrophobic cluster the  ylw  patch we demonstrate the profound impact of the pspf w  loop residues on atp hydrolysis the   binding loop  and the self association interface we infer from single chain studies that for complete pspf inhibition to occur more than three pspa subunits need to bind a pspf hexamer with at least two binding to adjacent pspf subunits by structural modelling we propose that pspa binds to pspf via its first two helical domains after pspf binding induced conformational changes pspa may then share structural similarities with a bebp regulatory domain
