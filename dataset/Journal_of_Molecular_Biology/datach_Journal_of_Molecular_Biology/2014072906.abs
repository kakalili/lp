the f  reducing nife hydrogenase complex from methanothermobacter marburgensis the first x ray structure of a group  family member
the reversible redox reaction between coenzyme f  and h to f  h is catalyzed by an f  reducing nife hydrogenase frhabg  which is an enzyme of the energy metabolism of methanogenic archaea frhabg is a group  nife hydrogenase with a dodecameric quaternary structure of   mda as recently revealed by high resolution cryo electron microscopy we report on the crystal structure of frhabg from methanothermobacter marburgensis at    resolution and compare it with the structures of group  nife hydrogenases the only group structurally characterized yet frha is similar to the large subunit of group  nife hydrogenases regarding its core structure and the embedded nife center but is different because of the truncation of ca   residues that results in similar but modified h and proton transport pathways and in suitable interfaces for oligomerization the small subunit frhg is composed of an n terminal domain related to group  enzymes and a new c terminal ferredoxin like domain carrying the distal and medial  fe s clusters frhb adopts a novel fold binds one  fe s cluster as well as one fad in a u shaped conformation and provides the f  binding site at the si face of the isoalloxazine ring similar electrochemical potentials of both catalytic reactions and the electron transferring  fe s clusters determined to be e       mv are in full agreement with the equalized forward and backward rates of the frhabg reaction the protein might contribute to balanced redox potentials by the aspartate coordination of the proximal  fe s cluster the new ferredoxin module and a rather negatively charged fad surrounding
