flexibility within the heads of muscle myosin  molecules
we show that negative stain electron microscopy and image processing of nucleotide free apo striated muscle myosin  subfragment  s  possessing one light chain or both light chains is capable of resolving significant amounts of structural detail the overall appearance of the motor and the lever is similar in rabbit scallop and chicken s  projection matching of class averages of the different s types to projection views of two different crystal structures of apo s shows that all types most commonly closely resemble the appearance of the scallop s structure rather than the methylated chicken s structure methylation of chicken s has no effect on the structure of the molecule at this resolution it too resembles the scallop s crystal structure the lever is found to vary in its angle of attachment to the motor domain with a hinge point located in the so called pliant region between the converter and the essential light chain the chicken s crystal structure lies near one end of the range of flexion observed the gaussian spread of angles of flexion suggests that flexibility is driven thermally from which a torsional spring constant of  pn nm rad is estimated on average for all s types similar to myosin  this translates to apparent cantilever type stiffness at the tip of the lever of   pn nm because this stiffness is lower than recent estimates from myosin  heads attached to actin we suggest that binding to actin leads to an allosteric stiffening of the motor  lever junction
