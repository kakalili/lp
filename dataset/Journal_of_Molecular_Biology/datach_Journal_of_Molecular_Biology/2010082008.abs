crystal structure and functional analysis of the glutaminyl cyclase from xanthomonas campestris
glutaminyl cyclases qcs  ec     catalyze the formation of pyroglutamate pglu at the n terminus of many proteins and peptides a critical step for the maturation of these bioactive molecules proteins having qc activity have been identified in animals and plants but not in bacteria here we report the first bacterial qc from the plant pathogen xanthomonas campestris xc  the crystal structure of the enzyme was solved and refined to     resolution the structure shows a five bladed  propeller and exhibits a scaffold similar to that of papaya qc pqc  but with some sequence deletions and conformational changes in contrast to the pqc structure the active site of xcqc has a wider substrate binding pocket but its accessibility is modulated by a protruding loop acting as a flap enzyme activity analyses showed that the wild type xcqc possesses only  qc activity compared to that of pqc superposition of those two structures revealed that an active site glutamine residue in pqc is substituted by a glutamate glu  in xcqc although position  is a glutamine in most bacterial qc sequences the e q mutation increased the qc activity by an order of magnitude but the mutation e a led to a drop in the enzyme activity indicating the critical catalytic role of this residue further mutagenesis studies support the catalytic role of glu  as proposed previously and confirm the importance of several conserved amino acids around the substrate binding pocket xcqc was shown to be weakly resistant to guanidine hydrochloride extreme ph and heat denaturations in contrast to the extremely high stability of pqc despite their similar scaffold on the basis of structure comparison the low stability of xcqc may be attributed to the absence of both a disulfide linkage and some hydrogen bonds in the closure of  propeller structure these results significantly improve our understanding of the catalytic mechanism and extreme stability of type i qcs which will be useful in further applications of qc enzymes
