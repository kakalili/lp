Many eukaryotic proteins are co and post-translationally modified at their N termini by removal of one or two amino acid residues and Nα-acetylation. Actins show two different forms of N-terminal processing dependent on their N-terminal sequence. In class II actins, which include muscle actins, the common primary sequence of Met-Cys-Asp-actin is processed to acetyl-Asp-actin. The functional significance of this in vivo is unknown. We have studied the indirect flight muscle-specific actin, ACT88F, of Drosophila melanogaster. Our results show that ACT88F is N-terminally processed in vivo as a class II actin by removal of the first two amino acid residues (Met and Cys), but that uniquely the N terminus is not acetylated. In addition we show that ACT88F is methylated, probably at His73.Flies carrying the mod− mutation fail to complete post-translational processing of ACT88F. We propose that the mod gene product is normally responsible for removing N-acetyl-cysteine from actin. The biological significance of this process is demonstrated by observations that retention of the N-acetyl-cysteine in ACT88F affects the flight muscle function of mod− flies. This suggests that the extreme N terminus affects actomyosin interactions in vivo, a proposal we have examined by in vitro motility assays of ACT88F F-actin from mod− flies. The mod− actin only moves in the presence of methylcellulose, a viscosity-enhancing agent, where it moves at velocities slightly, but significantly, reduced compared to wild-type. These data confirm that N-acetyl-cysteine at the N terminus affects actomyosin interactions, probably by reducing formation of the initial actomyosin collision complex, a process known to involve the actin N terminus.
