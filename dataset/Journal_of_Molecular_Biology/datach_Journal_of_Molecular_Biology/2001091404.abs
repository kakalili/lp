the role in flagellar rod assembly of the n terminal domain of salmonella flgj a flagellum specific muramidase edited by m f moody
the c terminal half of the salmonella flagellar protein flgj has peptidoglycan hydrolyzing activity and it has been suggested that it is a flagellum specific muramidase which locally digests the peptidoglycan layer to permit assembly of the rod structure to proceed through the periplasmic space it was also suggested that flgj might be involved in rod formation itself although there was no direct evidence for this we purified basal body structures from sjw   flgj transformed with plasmids encoding various mutant flgj proteins and found that these basal bodies possessed the periplasmic p ring but lacked the outer membrane l ring they also lacked a hook at their distal end all of these mutant flgj proteins had an altered or missing c terminal domain but had at least the first   amino acid residues of the n terminal domain immunoblotting analysis of fractionated cell extracts revealed that a rod hook export class protein flgd was exported to the periplasm but not to the culture supernatant in these mutants flgj was shown to physically interact with several proteins and especially flie and flgb which are believed to reside at the cell proximal end of the rod on the basis of these results we conclude that the n terminal   amino acid residues of flgj are directly involved in rod formation and that the muramidase activity of flgj though needed for formation of the l ring and subsequent events such as hook formation is not essential for rod or p ring formation in contrast muramidase activity alone does not support rod assembly
