crystal structures of the pro inflammatory cytokine interleukin  and its complex with a high affinity neutralizing antibody
interleukin il   is a pro inflammatory cytokine playing a key role in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases we have determined the crystal structures of the heterodimeric p   p  il  and its complex with the fab antigen binding fragment of a neutralizing antibody at   and     respectively the il  structure closely resembles that of il   they share the common p  subunit and il  p  overlaps well with il  p  along the hydrophilic heterodimeric interface fewer charged residues are involved for il  compared with il   the binding site of the fab is located exclusively on the p  subunit and comparison with published cytokine  receptor structures suggests that it overlaps with the il  receptor binding site
