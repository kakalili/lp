structure and function of the feob g domain from methanococcus jannaschii
feob in bacteria and archaea is involved in the uptake of ferrous iron fe   an important cofactor in biological electron transfer and catalysis unlike any other known prokaryotic membrane protein feob contains a gtp binding domain at its n terminus we determined high resolution x ray structures of the feob g domain from methanococcus jannaschii with and without bound gdp or mg  gppnhp the g domain forms the same dimer in all three structures with the nucleotide binding pockets at the dimer interface as in the atp binding domain of abc transporters the g domain follows the typical fold of nucleotide binding proteins with a  strand inserted in switch i that becomes partially disordered upon gtp binding switch ii does not contact the nucleotide directly and does not change its conformation in response to the bound nucleotide release of the nucleotide causes a rearrangement of loop l  which we identified as the g region of feob together with the c terminal helix this loop may transmit the information about the nucleotide bound state from the g domain to the transmembrane region of feob
