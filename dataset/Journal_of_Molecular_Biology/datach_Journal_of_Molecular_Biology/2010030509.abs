evolutionary optimization of computationally designed enzymes kemp eliminases of the ke  series
understanding enzyme catalysis through the analysis of natural enzymes is a daunting challenge  their active sites are complex and combine numerous interactions and catalytic forces that are finely coordinated study of more rudimentary wo man made enzymes provides a unique opportunity for better understanding of enzymatic catalysis ke  a computationally designed kemp eliminase that employs a glutamate side chain as the catalytic base for the critical proton abstraction step and an apolar binding site to guide substrate binding was optimized by seven rounds of random mutagenesis and selection resulting in a gt   fold increase in catalytic efficiency here we describe the directed evolution process in detail and the biophysical and crystallographic studies of the designed ke  and its evolved variants the optimization of ke  s activity to give a kcat km value of     s   m   and an    fold rate acceleration kcat kuncat involved the incorporation of up to eight mutations these mutations led to a marked decrease in the overall thermodynamic stability of the evolved ke s and in the configurational stability of their active sites we identified two primary contributions of the mutations to ke  s improved activity  i the introduction of new salt bridges to correct a mistake in the original design that placed a lysine for leaving group protonation without consideration of its  quenching  interactions with the catalytic glutamate and ii the tuning of the environment the pka of the catalytic base and its interactions with the substrate through the evolution of a network of hydrogen bonds consisting of several charged residues surrounding the active site
