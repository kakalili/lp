towards multiparametric fluorescent imaging of amyloid formation studies of a yfp model of  synuclein aggregation
misfolding and aggregation of proteins are characteristics of a range of increasingly prevalent neurodegenerative disorders including alzheimer s and parkinson s diseases in parkinson s disease and several closely related syndromes the protein  synuclein as aggregates and forms amyloid like deposits in specific regions of the brain fluorescence microscopy using fluorescent proteins for instance the yellow fluorescent protein yfp  is the method of choice to image molecular events such as protein aggregation in living organisms the presence of a bulky fluorescent protein tag however may potentially affect significantly the properties of the protein of interest for as in particular its relative small size and as an intrinsically unfolded protein its lack of defined secondary structure could challenge the usefulness of fluorescent protein based derivatives here we subject a yfp fusion of as to exhaustive studies in vitro designed to determine its potential as a means of probing amyloid formation in vivo by employing a combination of biophysical and biochemical studies we demonstrate that the conjugation of yfp does not significantly perturb the structure of as in solution and find that the as yfp protein forms amyloid deposits in vitro that are essentially identical with those observed for wild type as except that they are fluorescent of the several fluorescent properties of the yfp chimera that were assayed we find that fluorescence anisotropy is a particularly useful parameter to follow the aggregation of as yfp because of energy migration f rster resonance energy transfer emfret or homofret between closely positioned yfp moieties occurring as a result of the high density of the fluorophore within the amyloid species fluorescence anisotropy imaging microscopy further demonstrates the ability of homofret to distinguish between soluble pre fibrillar aggregates and amyloid fibrils of as yfp our results validate the use of fluorescent protein chimeras of as as representative models for studying protein aggregation and offer new opportunities for the investigation of amyloid aggregation in vivo using yfp tagged proteins
