predicting changes in the stability of proteins and protein complexes a study of more than   mutations
we have developed a computer algorithm foldef for fold x energy function  to provide a fast and quantitative estimation of the importance of the interactions contributing to the stability of proteins and protein complexes the predictive power of foldef was tested on a very large set of point mutants    mutants spanning most of the structural environments found in proteins foldef uses a full atomic description of the structure of the proteins the different energy terms taken into account in foldef have been weighted using empirical data obtained from protein engineering experiments first we considered a training database of   mutants in nine different proteins and optimised the set of parameters and weighting factors that best accounted for the changes in stability of the mutants the predictive power of the method was then tested using a blind test mutant database of   mutants as well as a database of  protein  protein complex mutants the global correlation obtained for   of the entire mutant database    mutants is   with a standard deviation of   kcalmol   and a slope of    the present energy function uses a minimum of computational resources and can therefore easily be used in protein design algorithms and in the field of protein structure and folding pathways prediction where one requires a fast and accurate energy function foldef is available via a web interface at http  fold x embl heidelberg de
