crystal structure of the talin integrin binding domain
integrins are transmembrane receptors that mediate cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix and play essential roles in tissue development and maintenance the cytoplasmic segment of integrin associates with talin a large intracellular protein that links integrin to the actin cytoskeleton binding of talin via an integrin binding segment ibs  results in large conformational changes in the extracellular portion of integrin which modulates the affinity of integrins for their extracellular matrix ligands however integrin binding also requires a second segment of talin ibs  despite detailed descriptions of the integrin  ibs binding the molecular determinants that drive the integrin  ibs association are poorly understood here we describe the crystal structure of the talin ibs domain which forms a five helix bundle the large structural homology with a vinculin binding domain hints at an ancient gene duplication and suggests that helix  may bind to vinculin if the bundle is unfolded mapping previous mutations on the surface highlights a likely binding interface for integrin
