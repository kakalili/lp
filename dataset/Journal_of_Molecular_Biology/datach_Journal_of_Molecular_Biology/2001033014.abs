distinct cysteine sulfhydryl environments detected by analysis of raman s h markers of cys  ser mutant proteins edited by p e wright
very little is known about the character or functional relevance of hydrogen bonded cysteine sulfhydryl s h groups in proteins the raman s h band is a unique and sensitive probe of the local s h environment here we report the use of raman spectroscopy combined with site specific mutagenesis to document the existence of five distinguishable hydrogen bonded states of buried cysteine sulfhydryl groups in a native protein the   residue subunit of the salmonella typhimurium bacteriophage p  tailspike contains eight cysteine residues distributed through the elongated structure the tailspike cysteine residues display an unusual raman s h band complex      cm   interval indicative of diverse s h hydrogen bonding interactions in the native trimeric structure to resolve specific cys contributions to the complex raman band we characterized a set of tailspike proteins with each cysteine replaced by a serine the mutant proteins once folded were structurally and functionally indistinguishable from wild type tailspikes except for their raman s h signatures comparison of the raman spectra of the mutant and wild type proteins reveals the following hydrogen bond classes for cysteine sulfhydryl groups  i cys  forms the strongest s h  x bond of the tailspike stronger than any heretofore observed for a protein  ii cys   cys  and cys  form robust s h  x bonds  iii moderate s h  x bonding occurs for cys  and cys   iv cys  and cys  form weak hydrogen bonds  v it is remarkable that cys  contributes two raman s h markers indicating the population of two distinct hydrogen bonding states the sum of the s h raman signatures of all eight mutants accurately reproduces the composite raman band of the wild type tailspike the diverse cysteine states may be an outcome of the folding and assembly pathway of the tailspike which though lacking disulfide bonds in the native state utilizes transient disulfide bonds in the maturation pathway this raman study represents the first detailed assessment of local s h hydrogen bonding in a native protein and provides information not obtainable directly by other structural probes the method employed here should be applicable to a wide range of cysteine containing proteins
