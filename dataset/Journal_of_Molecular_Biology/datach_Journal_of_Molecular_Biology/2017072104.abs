crystal structure of the c terminal domain of human eif d and its implications on eukaryotic translation initiation
protein synthesis is a key process in all living organisms in eukaryotes initiation factor  eif  plays an important role in translation initiation as it selects and delivers the initiator trna to the small ribosomal subunit under stress conditions phosphorylation of the  subunit of eif downregulates cellular protein synthesis however translation of certain mrnas continues via the eif d dependent non canonical initiation pathway the molecular mechanism of this process remains elusive in addition eif d plays a role in translation re initiation and ribosome recycling currently there has been no structural information of eif d we have now determined the crystal structure of the c terminal domains of eif d at    resolution one domain has the fold similar to that of eif  which is crucial for the scanning and initiation codon selection the second domain has a known swib mdm fold which was not observed before in other translation initiation factors our structure reveals atomic details of inter domain interactions in the c terminal part of eif d and sheds light on the possible role of these domains in eif d during translation
