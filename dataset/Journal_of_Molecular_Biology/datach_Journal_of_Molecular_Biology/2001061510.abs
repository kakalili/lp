crystal structure of a heptameric sm like protein complex from archaea implications for the structure and evolution of snrnps edited by j doudna
the sm lsm proteins associate with small nuclear rna to form the core of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins required for processes as diverse as pre mrna splicing mrna degradation and telomere formation the lsm proteins from archaea are likely to represent the ancestral sm lsm domain here we present the crystal structure of the lsm  protein from the thermophilic archaeon methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum at    resolution the lsm  protein crystallizes as a heptameric ring comprised of seven identical subunits interacting via  strand pairing and hydrophobic interactions the heptamer can be viewed as a propeller like structure in which each blade consists of a seven stranded antiparallel  sheet formed from neighbouring subunits there are seven slots on the inner surface of the heptamer ring each of which is lined by asp asn and arg residues that are highly conserved in the sm lsm sequences these conserved slots are likely to form the rna binding site in archaea the gene encoding lsm  is located next to the l e ribosomal protein gene in a putative operon suggesting a role for the lsm  complex in ribosome function or biogenesis
