endostatins derived from collagens xv and xviii differ in structural and binding properties tissue distribution and anti angiogenic activity edited by a fersht
endostatin is a fragment of the c terminal domain nc of collagen xviii that inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth we report the characterization of a collagen xv endostatin analogue and its parent nc domain obtained by recombinant expression in mammalian cells both nc domains contain a trimerization domain a hinge region that is more sensitive to proteolysis in collagen xviii and the endostatin domain unlike endostatin xviii endostatin xv does not bind zinc or heparin which is explained by the crystal structure of endostatin xv the collagen xv and xviii fragments inhibited chorioallantoic membrane angiogenesis induced by basic fibroblast growth factor fgf  or vascular endothelial growth factor vegf  but there are striking differences depending on which cytokine is used and whether free endostatins or nc domains are applied the collagen xv and xviii fragments showed a similar binding repertoire for extracellular matrix proteins differences were found in the immunohistological localization in vessel walls and basement membrane zones together these data indentify endostatin xv as an angiogenesis inhibitor which differs from endostatin xviii in several important functional details
