Biosynthetically and chemically derived analogs of the antibiotic pactamycin and de-6-methylsalicylyl (MSA)-pactamycin have attracted recent interest as potential antiprotozoal and antitumor drugs. Here, we report a 3.1-Ã… crystal structure of de-6-MSA-pactamycin bound to its target site on the Thermus thermophilus 30S ribosomal subunit. Although de-6-MSA-pactamycin lacks the MSA moiety, it shares the same binding site as pactamycin and induces a displacement of nucleic acid template bound at the E-site of the 30S. The structure highlights unique interactions between this pactamycin analog and the ribosome, which paves the way for therapeutic development of related compounds.
