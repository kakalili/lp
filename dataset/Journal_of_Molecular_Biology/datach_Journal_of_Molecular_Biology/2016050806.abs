origin and functional evolution of the cdc  p  vcp aaa protein unfolding and remodeling machine
the aaa cdc  atpase alias p  or vcp is a key player in multiple ubiquitin dependent cell signaling degradation and quality control pathways central to these broad biological functions is the ability of cdc  to interact with a large number of adaptor proteins and to remodel macromolecular proteins and their complexes different models have been proposed to explain how cdc  might couple atp hydrolysis to forcible unfolding dissociation or remodeling of cellular clients in this review we provide an overview of possible mechanisms for substrate unfolding remodeling by this conserved and essential aaa protein machine and their adaption and possible biological function throughout evolution
