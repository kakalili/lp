conformational changes of the ferric uptake regulation protein upon metal activation and dna binding first evidence of structural homologies with the diphtheria toxin repressor edited by g v heijne
fur ferric uptake regulation protein is a bacterial global regulator that uses iron as a cofactor to bind to specific dna sequences it has been suggested that metal binding induces a conformational change in the protein which is subsequently able to recognize dna this mechanism of activation has been investigated here using selective chemical modification monitored by mass spectrometry the reactivity of each lysine residue of the fur protein was studied first in the apo form of the protein then after metal activation and finally after dna binding of particular interest is lys  which was shown to be highly protected from modification in the presence of target dna hydrogen deuterium exchange experiments were performed to map with higher resolution the conformational changes induced by metal binding on the basis of these results together with a secondary structure prediction the presence in fur of a non classical helix turn helix motif is proposed experimental results show that activation upon metal binding induces conformational modification of this specific motif the recognition helix interacting directly with the major groove of the dna would include the domain y  f   this helix would be followed by a small  wing  formed between two beta strands containing lys  which might interact directly with dna these results suggest that fur and dtxr diphtheria toxin repressor  another bacterial repressor share not only the function of being iron concentration regulators and the structure of their dna binding domain
