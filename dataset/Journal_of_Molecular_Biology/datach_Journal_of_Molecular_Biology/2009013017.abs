apo and calcium bound crystal structures of cytoskeletal protein alpha  giardin annexin e  from the intestinal protozoan parasite giardia lamblia
alpha  giardin annexin e  a member of the alpha giardin family of annexins has been shown to localize to the flagella of the intestinal protozoan parasite giardia lamblia alpha giardins show a common ancestry with the annexins a family of proteins most of which bind to phospholipids and cellular membranes in a ca  dependent manner and are implicated in numerous membrane related processes including cytoskeletal rearrangements and membrane organization it has been proposed that alpha  giardin may play a significant role during the cytoskeletal rearrangement during differentiation of giardia to gain a better understanding of alpha  giardin s mode of action and its biological role we have determined the three dimensional structure of alpha  giardin and its phospholipid binding properties here we report the apo crystal structure of alpha  giardin determined in two different crystal forms as well as the ca  bound crystal structure of alpha  giardin refined to     and      respectively although the overall fold of alpha  giardin is similar to that of alpha  giardin multiwavelength anomalous dispersion phasing was required to solve the alpha  giardin structure indicating significant structural differences between these two members of the alpha giardin family unlike most annexin structures which typically possess n terminal domains alpha  giardin is composed of only a core domain followed by a c terminal extension that may serve as a ligand for binding to cytoskeletal protein partners in giardia in the ca  bound structure we detected five bound calcium ions one of which is a novel highly coordinated calcium binding site not previously observed in annexin structures this novel high affinity calcium binding site is composed of seven protein donor groups a feature rarely observed in crystal structures in addition phospholipid binding assays suggest that alpha  giardin exhibits calcium dependent binding to phospholipids that coordinate cytoskeletal disassembly assembly during differentiation of the parasite
