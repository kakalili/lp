structural basis for rab  mediated recruitment of fip to recycling endosomes
the rab  gtpase regulates recycling of internalized plasma membrane receptors and is essential for completion of cytokinesis a family of rab  interacting proteins fips that conserve a c terminal rab binding domain rbd selectively recognize the active form of rab  normal completion of cytokinesis requires a complex between rab  and fip  here we report the crystal structure and mutational analysis of a heterotetrameric complex between constitutively active rab  and a fip construct that includes the rbd two rab  molecules bind to dyad symmetric sites at the c terminus of fip  which forms a non canonical coiled coiled dimer with a flared c terminus and hook region the rbd overlaps with the coiled coil and extends through the c terminal hook although fip engages the switch and interswitch regions of rab  the mode of interaction differs significantly from that of other rab effector complexes in particular the switch ii region undergoes a large structural rearrangement from an ordered but non complementary active conformation to a remodeled conformation that facilitates the interaction with fip  finally we provide evidence that fip can form homo oligomers in cells and that a critical determinant of rab  binding in vitro is necessary for fip recruitment to recycling endosomes during cytokinesis
