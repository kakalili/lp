clustering of protein domains in the human genome
we present a systematic study of the clustering of genes within the human genome based on homology inferred from both sequence and structural similarity the d genomics automated proteome annotation pipeline www sbg bio ic ac uk dgenomics was utilised to infer homology for each protein domain in the genome for the  superfamilies most highly represented in the structural classification of proteins scop database this approach enabled us to identify homologues that could not be detected by sequence based methods alone for each superfamily we investigated the distribution both within and among chromosomes of genes encoding at least one domain within the superfamily the results indicate a diversity of clustering behaviours some superfamilies showed no evidence of any clustering and others displayed significant clustering either within or among chromosomes or both removal of tandem repeats reduced the levels of clustering observed but some superfamilies still displayed highly significant clustering thus our study suggests that either the process of gene duplication or the evolution of the resulting clusters differs between structural superfamilies
