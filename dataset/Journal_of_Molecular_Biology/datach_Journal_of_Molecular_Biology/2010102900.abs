mechanism of dephosphorylation of the sr protein asf sf by protein phosphatase
sr proteins are essential splicing factors whose function is controlled by multi site phosphorylation of a c terminal domain rich in arginine  serine repeats rs domain  the protein kinase srpk has been shown to polyphosphorylate the n terminal portion of the rs domain rs  of the sr protein asf sf  a modification that promotes nuclear entry of this splicing factor and engagement in splicing function later dephosphorylation is required for maturation of the spliceosome and other rna processing steps while phosphates are attached to rs in a sequential manner by srpk  little is known about how they are removed to investigate factors that control dephosphorylation we monitored region specific mapping of phosphorylation sites in asf sf as a function of the protein phosphatase pp  we showed that  phosphates added to the rs segment by srpk are removed in a preferred n to c manner directly opposing the c to n phosphorylation by srpk  two n terminal rna recognition motifs in asf sf control access to the rs domain and guide the directional mechanism binding of rna to the rna recognition motifs protects against dephosphorylation suggesting that engagement of the sr protein with exonic splicing enhancers can regulate phosphoryl content in the rs domain in addition to regulation by n terminal domains phosphorylation of the c terminal portion of the rs domain rs  by the nuclear protein kinase clk sty inhibits rs dephosphorylation and disrupts the directional mechanism the data indicate that both rna  protein interactions and phosphorylation in flanking sequences induce conformations of asf sf that increase the lifetime of phosphates in the rs domain
