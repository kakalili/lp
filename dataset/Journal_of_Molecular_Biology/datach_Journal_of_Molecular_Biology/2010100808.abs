structural basis for the dual recognition of il  and il  by ustekinumab
interleukin il   and il  are heterodimeric proinflammatory cytokines that share a common p  subunit paired with p  and p  subunits respectively they represent an attractive class of therapeutic targets for the treatment of psoriasis and other immune mediated diseases ustekinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody mab that binds specifically to il  il  p  and neutralizes human il  and il  bioactivity the crystal structure of ustekinumab fab antigen binding fragment of mab  in complex with human il   has been determined by x ray crystallography at     resolution ustekinumab fab binds the d domain of the p  subunit in a   ratio in the crystal consistent with a  cytokines  mab stoichiometry as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry the structure indicates that ustekinumab binds to the same epitope on p  in both il  and il  with identical interactions mutational analyses confirm that several residues identified in the il  il  p  epitope provide important molecular binding interactions with ustekinumab the electrostatic complementarity between the mab antigen binding site and the p  d domain epitope appears to play a key role in antibody antigen recognition specificity interestingly this structure also reveals significant structural differences in the p  subunit and p  p  interface compared with the published crystal structure of human il   suggesting unusual and potentially functionally relevant structural flexibility of p  as well as p  p  recognition collectively these data describe unique observations about il  p  and ustekinumab interactions with p  that account for its dual binding and neutralization of il  and il
