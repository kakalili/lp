folding of tetrameric p  oligomerization and tumorigenic mutations induce misfolding and loss of function
the physiologically active form of p  consists of a tetramer of four identical   amino acid subunits associated via their tetramerization domains tds residues       one in two human tumors contains a point mutation in the dna binding domain dbd of p  residues      most existing studies on the effects of these mutations on p  structure and function have been carried out on the isolated dbd fragment which is monomeric recent structural evidence however suggests that dbds may interact with each other in full length tetrameric forms of p  here we investigate the effects of tumorigenic dbd mutations on the folding of p  in its tetrameric form we employ the construct consisting of dbd and td amino acids      we characterize the stability and conformational state of the tumorigenic dbd mutants r  q r  s and r  q using equilibrium denaturation and functional assays destabilizing mutations cause dbd to misfold when it is part of the p  tetramer but not when it is monomeric this conformation is populated under moderately destabilizing conditions    c in  m urea and at physiological temperature in the absence of denaturant  under those same conditions it is not present in the isolated dbd fragment or in the presence of the td mutation l  p which abolishes tetramerization misfolding appears to involve intramolecular dbd  dbd association within a single tetrameric molecule this association is promoted by destabilization of dbd caused by mutation or elevated temperature and by the high local dbd concentration enforced by tetramerization of td disrupting the nonnative dbd  dbd interaction or transiently inhibiting tetramerization and allowing p  to fold as a monomer may be potential strategies for pharmacological intervention in cancer
