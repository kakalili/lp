flipping of the ribosomal a site adenines provides a basis for trna selection
ribosomes control the missense error rate of     during translation though quantitative contributions of individual mechanistic steps of the conformational changes yet to be fully determined biochemical and biophysical studies led to a qualitative trna selection model in which ribosomal a site residues a   and a   a    flip out in response to cognate trna binding promoting the subsequent reactions but not in the case of near cognate or non cognate trna however this model was recently questioned by x ray structures revealing conformations of extrahelical a    and domain closure of the decoding center in both cognate and near cognate trna bound ribosome complexes suggesting that the non specific flipping of a    has no active role in trna selection we explore this question by carrying out molecular dynamics simulations aided with fluorescence and nmr experiments to probe the free energy cost of extrahelical flipping of    and the strain energy associated with domain conformational change our rigorous calculations demonstrate that the a    flipping is indeed a specific response to the binding of cognate trna contributing kcal mol to the specificity of trna selection furthermore the different a minor interactions in cognate and near cognate complexes propagate into the conformational strain and contribute another kcal mol in domain closure the recent structure of ribosome with features of extrahelical a    and closed domain in near cognate complex is reconciled by possible tautomerization of the wobble base pair in mrna  trna these results quantitatively rationalize other independent experimental observations and explain the ribosomal discrimination mechanism of selecting cognate versus near cognate trna
