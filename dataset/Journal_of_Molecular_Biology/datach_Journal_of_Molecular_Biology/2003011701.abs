substitutions at phe  in the     hairpin of hiv  reverse transcriptase reveal a role for the fingers subdomain in strand displacement dna synthesis
unlike most dna polymerases retroviral reverse transcriptases rts are capable of strand displacement dna synthesis in vitro unassisted by other proteins while human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  rt has been shown to possess this rare ability the structural determinants responsible are unknown x ray crystallographic and biochemical studies have indicated that the     hairpin of the fingers subdomain of hiv  rt contains key contacts for the incoming template strand in order to assess the possible role of the fingers subdomain in strand displacement synthesis a set of substitutions was created at the highly conserved phe  residue which is thought to contact the template strand immediately ahead of the dntp binding site purified heterodimeric rts containing phe  substitutions displayed altered degrees of strand displacement synthesis on nicked and gapped duplex dna templates with the relative order being f y  f l gt wild type f a gt f w in order to verify that the effects on strand displacement synthesis were not an indirect effect of alterations in processivity all phe  mutants were tested for processive polymerization while the strand displacement activity of f w rt variant was affected severely it displayed a wild type like processivity in contrast both f l and f y substitutions despite showing enhanced strand displacement synthesis displayed reduced processivity in contrast the processivity of f a mutant which had displayed nearly wild type like strand displacement synthesis was affected most these results showed that the effects of phe  substitutions on strand displacement are not due to global changes in polymerase processivity analysis of pause sites during dna polymerization on double stranded templates revealed that the wild type and the phe  mutant rts interact with the template quite differently modeling a nt duplex dna ahead of the dntp binding site of hiv  rt suggested a correlation between the ability of the side chain of the amino acid residue at position  to stabilize the first base pair of the dna duplex to be melted and the degree of strand displacement synthesis our results confirm a role for f  residue in processive synthesis and indicate that the fingers subdomain harbors a structural determinant of strand displacement synthesis by hiv  rt
