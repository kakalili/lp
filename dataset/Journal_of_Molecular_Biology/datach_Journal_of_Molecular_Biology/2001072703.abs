solution structure of the catalytic domain of   resolvase implications for the mechanism of catalysis edited by p e wright
the site specific dna recombinase    resolvase from escherichia coli catalyzes recombination of res site containing plasmid dna to two catenated circular dna products the catalytic domain residues     lacking a c terminal dimerization interface has been constructed and the nmr solution structure of the monomer determined the rmsd of the nmr conformers for residues    excluding residues     and     is     for backbone atoms and     for all heavy atoms the nmr solution structure of the monomeric catalytic domain residues     was found to be formed by a four stranded parallel  sheet surrounded by three helices the catalytic domain residues      deficient in the c terminal dimerization domain was monomeric at high salt concentration but displayed unexpected dimerization at lower ionic strength the unique solution dimerization interface at low ionic strength was mapped by nmr with respect to previous crystal structures of the dimeric catalytic domain residues     differences in the average conformation of active site residues were found at loop  containing the catalytic s  nucleophile the   strand containing r  and at loop  containing d  r  and r  which are required for catalysis the active site loops display high frequency and conformational backbone dynamics and are less well defined than the secondary structures in the solution structure the d  side chain is proximal to the s  side chain making the d  carboxylate group a candidate for activation of s  through general base catalysis four conserved arg residues can function in the activation of the phosphodiester for nucleophilic attack by the s  hydroxyl group a mechanism for covalent catalysis by this class of recombinases is proposed that may be related to dimer interface dissociation
