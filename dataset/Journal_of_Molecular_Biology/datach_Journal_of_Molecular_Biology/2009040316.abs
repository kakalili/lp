proline isomerization preorganizes the itk sh domain for binding to the itk sh domain
we report here the nmr derived structure of the binary complex formed by the interleukin  tyrosine kinase itk src homology  sh  and src homology  sh  domains the interaction is independent of both a phosphotyrosine motif and a proline rich sequence the classical targets of the sh and sh domains respectively the itk sh sh structure reveals the molecular details of this nonclassical interaction and provides a clear picture for how the previously described prolyl cis trans isomerization present in the itk sh domain mediates sh binding the higher affinity cis sh conformer is preorganized to form a hydrophobic interface with the sh domain the structure also provides insight into how autophosphorylation in the itk sh domain might increase the affinity of the intermolecular sh sh interaction finally we can compare this itk complex with other examples of sh and sh domains engaging their ligands in a nonclassical manner these small binding domains exhibit a surprising level of diversity in their binding repertoires
