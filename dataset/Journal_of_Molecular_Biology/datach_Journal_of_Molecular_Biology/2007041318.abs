the structures of antibiotics bound to the e site region of the  s ribosomal subunit of haloarcula marismortui   deoxytedanolide and girodazole
crystal structures of the  s ribosomal subunit from haloarcula marismortui complexed with two antibiotics have identified new sites at which antibiotics interact with the ribosome and inhibit protein synthesis   deoxytedanolide binds to the e site of the  s subunit at the same location as the cca of trna and thus appears to inhibit protein synthesis by competing with deacylated trnas for e site binding girodazole binds near the e site region but is somewhat buried and may inhibit trna binding by interfering with conformational changes that occur at the e site the specificity of  deoxytedanolide for eukaryotic ribosomes is explained by its extensive interactions with protein l e which is an e site component of archaeal and eukaryotic ribosomes but not of eubacterial ribosomes in addition protein l  which is unique to the eubacterial e site overlaps the site occupied by  deoxytedanolide precluding its binding to eubacterial ribosomes girodazole is specific for eukarytes and archaea because it makes interactions with l  that are not possible in eubacteria
