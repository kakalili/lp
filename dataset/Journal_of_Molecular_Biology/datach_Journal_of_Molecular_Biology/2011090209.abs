a hydrogen bond regulates slow motions in ubiquitin by modulating a  turn flip
proteins exist as conformational ensembles composed of multiple interchanging substates separated by kinetic barriers interconverting conformations are often difficult to probe owing to their sparse population and transient nature here we report the identification and characterization of a subset of conformations in ubiquitin that participate in microsecond to millisecond motions in the amides of ile  asn  and thr  a novel side chain to the backbone hydrogen bond that regulates these motions has also been identified combining our nmr studies with the available x ray data we have unearthed the physical process underlying slow motions  the interconversion of a type i into a type ii  turn flip at residues glu  through arg  interestingly the dominant conformer of wild type ubiquitin observed in solution near neutral ph is only represented by about   of the crystal structures the conformers generated as a result of the dynamics of the hydrogen bond appear to be correlated to ligand recognition by ubiquitin
