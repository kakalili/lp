impact of disease mutations on the desmin filament assembly process
it has been documented that mutations in the human desmin gene lead to a severe type of myofibrillar myopathy termed more specifically desminopathy which affects cardiac and skeletal as well as smooth muscle we showed recently that  recombinant versions of these disease causing desmin variants all involving single amino acid substitutions in the  helical rod domain interfere with in vitro filament formation at distinct stages of the assembly process we now provide mechanistic details of how these mutations affect the filament assembly process by employing analytical ultracentrifugation time lapse electron microscopy of negatively stained and glycerol sprayed low angle rotary metal shadowed samples quantitative scanning transmission electron microscopy and viscometric studies in particular the soluble assembly intermediates of two of the mutated proteins exhibit unusually high s values compatible with octamers and other higher order complexes moreover several of the six filament forming mutant variants deviated considerably from wild type desmin with respect to their filament diameters and mass per length values in the heteropolymeric situation with wild type desmin four of the mutant variants caused a pronounced  hyper assembly   when assayed by viscometry this indicates that the various mutations may cause abortion of filament formation by the mutant protein at distinct stages and that some of them interfere severely with the assembly of wild type desmin taken together our findings provide novel insights into the basic intermediate filament assembly mechanisms and offer clues as to how amino acid changes within the desmin rod domain may interfere with the normal structural organization of the muscle cytoskeleton eventually leading to desminopathy
