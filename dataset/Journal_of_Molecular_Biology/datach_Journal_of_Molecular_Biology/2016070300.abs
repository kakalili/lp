the in vitro biochemical characterization of an hiv  restriction factor apobec f importance of loop  on both cd and cd for dna binding and deamination
apobec f a f is a member of the apolipoprotein b mrna editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide like apobec family of proteins that can deaminate cytosine c to uracil u on nucleic acids a f is one of the four apobec members with two zn coordinated homologous cytosine deaminase cd domains with the others being a g a d and a b here we report the in vitro characterization of dna binding and deaminase activities using purified wild type and various mutant proteins of a f from an escherichia coli expression system we show that even though cd is catalytically inactive and cd is the active deaminase domain presence of cd on the n terminus of cd enhances the deaminase activity by over an order of magnitude this enhancement of cd catalytic activity is mainly through the increase of substrate single stranded ss dna binding by the n terminal cd domain we further show that the loop  of both cd and cd of a f plays an important role for ssdna binding for each individual domain as well as for the deaminase activity of cd domain in the full length a f
