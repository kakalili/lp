cooperative binding of dominant negative prion protein to kringle domains
conversion of the cellular prion protein prpc to the pathogenic isoform prpsc is a major biochemical alteration in the progression of prion disease this conversion process is thought to require interaction between prpc and an as yet unidentified auxiliary factor provisionally designated protein x in searching for protein x we screened a phage display cdna expression library constructed from prion infected neuroblastoma scn a cells and identified a kringle protein domain using full length recombinant mouse prp recmoprp      hereafter recmoprp expressing a dominant negative mutation at codon   recmoprp q  k  in vitro binding analysis using elisa verified specific interaction of recmoprp to kringle domains k     with higher binding by recmoprp q  k than by full length recmoprp without the mutation this interaction was confirmed by competitive binding analysis in which the addition of either a specific anti kringle antibody or l lysine abolished the interaction biochemical studies of the interactions between k    and various concentrations of both recmoprp molecules demonstrated binding in a dose dependent manner a hill plot analysis of the data indicates positive cooperative binding of both recmoprp q  k and recmoprp to k    with stronger binding by recmoprp q  k  using full length and an n terminally truncated moprp      we demonstrate that n terminal sequences enable prp to bind strongly to k     further characterization with truncated moprp      refolded in different conformations revealed that both  helical and  sheet conformations bind to k     our data demonstrate specific high affinity binding of a dominant negative prp as well as binding of other prps to k     the relevance of such interactions during prion pathogenesis remains to be established
