the dimeric structure of the cpn   chaperonin of mycobacterium tuberculosis at     reveals possible modes of function
mycobacterium tuberculosis expresses two proteins cpn   and cpn   that belong to the chaperonin cpn family of heat shock proteins studies have shown that the two proteins have different functional roles in the bacterial life cycle and that cpn   is essential for cell viability and may be involved in m tuberculosis pathogenicity cpn   does not form a tetradecameric double ring which is typical of other cpns we have determined the crystal structure of recombinant cpn   to     resolution by molecular replacement the asymmetric unit au contains a dimer which is consistent with size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography and dynamic light scattering measurements of the soluble recombinant protein however we suggest that the actual cpn   dimer may be different from that identified within the au on the basis of surface contact stability solvation free energy gain and functional aspects unlike the dimer found in the au which is formed through apical domain interactions the dimeric form we propose here provides a free apical domain that is required for normal chaperone activity and may be involved in m tuberculosis association with macrophages and arthrosclerosis plaque formation here we describe in detail the structural aspects that lead to cpn   dimer formation and prevent the formation of heptameric rings and tetradecameric double rings
