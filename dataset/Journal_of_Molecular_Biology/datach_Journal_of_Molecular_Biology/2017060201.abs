determinants of helix formation for a kv  transmembrane segment inside the ribosome exit tunnel
proteins begin to fold in the ribosome and misfolding has pathological consequences among the earliest folding events in biogenesis is the formation of a helix an elementary structure that is ubiquitously present and required for correct protein folding in all proteomes the determinants underlying helix formation in the confined space of the ribosome exit tunnel are relatively unknown we chose the second transmembrane segment s  of a voltage gated potassium channel kv   as a model to probe this issue since the n terminus of s is initially in an extended conformation in the folding vestibule of the ribosome yet ultimately emerges at the exit port as a helix s is ideally suited for delineating sequential events and folding determinants of helix formation inside the ribosome we show that s s extended n terminus inside the tunnel is converted into a helix by a single distant mutation in the nascent peptide this transition depends on nascent peptide sequence at specific tunnel locations co translational secondary folding of nascent chains inside the ribosome has profound physiological consequences that bear on correct membrane insertion tertiary folding oligomerization and biochemical modification of the newborn protein during biogenesis
