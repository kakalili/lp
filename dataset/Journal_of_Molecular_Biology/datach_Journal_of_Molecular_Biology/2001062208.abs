protein dependent transition states for ribonucleoprotein assembly edited by d e draper
native folding and splicing by the saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial bi group i intron rna is facilitated by both the s cerevisiae cbp and neurospora crassa cyt  protein cofactors both protein bi rna complexes splice at similar rates suggesting that the rna active site structure is similar in both ribonucleoproteins in contrast the two proteins assemble with the bi rna by distinct mechanisms and bind opposing but partially overlapping sides of the group i intron catalytic core assembly with cbp is limited by a slow unimolecular rna folding step characterized by a negligible activation enthalpy we show that assembly with cyt  shows four distinctive features   cyt  binds stably to the bi rna at the diffusion controlled limit but assembly to a catalytically active rna structure is still limited by rna folding as visualized directly using time resolved footprinting   this mechanism of rapid stable protein binding followed by subsequent assembly steps has a distinctive kinetic signature the apparent ratio of koff to kon determined in a partitioning experiment differs from the equilibrium kd by a large factor   assembly with cyt  is characterized by a large activation enthalpy consistent with a rate limiting conformational rearrangement   because assembly from the kinetically trapped state is faster at elevated temperature we can identify conditions where cyt  accelerates catalyzes bi rna folding relative to assembly with cbp
