interaction between nucleosome assembly protein  like family members
mammals possess five nucleosome assembly protein  like nap l proteins with three of them being expressed exclusively in the nervous system the biological importance of the neuron specific nap l protein is demonstrated by the neural tube defects occurring during the embryonic development of nap l mutant mice which are associated with an overproliferation of neural stem cells and decreased neuronal differentiation nap l controls the expression of its target genes such as the cell cycle regulator cdkn c at least in part via an effect on histone acetylation using a two hybrid analysis we have identified several proteins interacting with nap l  including the ubiquitously expressed members of the nucleosome assembly protein family nap l and nap l  structural studies further predict that all five nap like proteins are able to interact directly via their highly conserved  helices these elements in conjunction with the coexpression of all the nap like proteins in neurons and the finding that deletion of nap l affects the cytoplasmic  nuclear distribution patterns of both nap l and nap l and their recruitment to target genes suggest that combinatorial variation within the nap family may ensure adaptation to the specific requirements for neuronal differentiation such as intercellular repartition chromatin modification transcriptional regulation or the recruitment of specific transcription factors
