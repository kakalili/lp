crystal structure of the csm  csm subcomplex in the type iii a crispr  cas interference complex
clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat crispr loci play a pivotal role in the prokaryotic host defense system against invading genetic materials the crispr loci are transcribed to produce crispr rnas crrnas  which form interference complexes with crispr associated cas proteins to target the invading nucleic acid for degradation the interference complex of the type iii a crispr  cas system is composed of five cas proteins csm  csm  and a crrna and targets invading dna here we show that the csm  csm  and csm proteins from methanocaldococcus jannaschii form a stable subcomplex we also report the crystal structure of the m jannaschii csm  csm subcomplex at    resolution the complex structure revealed the presence of a basic concave surface around their interface suggesting the rna and or dna binding ability of the complex a gel retardation analysis showed that the csm  csm complex binds single stranded rna in a non sequence specific manner csm structurally resembles cmr  a component of the type iii b crispr  cas interference complex based on bioinformatics we constructed a model structure of the csm  csm  csm ternary complex which provides insights into its role in the csm interference complex
