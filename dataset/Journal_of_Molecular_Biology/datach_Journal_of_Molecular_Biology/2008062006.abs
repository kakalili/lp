non canonical binding of an antibody resembling a na ve b cell receptor immunoglobulin to hepatitis b virus capsids
the hepatitis b virus capsid core antigen is able to bind to and activate na ve b cells and these become efficient primary antigen presenting cells for the priming of t cells we have investigated this interaction by using cryo electron microscopy three dimensional image reconstruction and molecular modeling to visualize capsids decorated with fab fragments of a receptor immunoglobulin and surface plasmon resonance to measure the binding affinity by both criteria the mode of binding differs from those of the six monoclonal anti core antigen antibodies previously characterized the fab interacts with two sites      apart one interaction is canonical whereby the cdr loops engage the tip of one of the    spikes that protrude from the capsid surface the second interaction is non canonical in it the fab framework contacts the tip of an adjacent spike the binding affinity of this fab for capsids kd        m is relatively low for an antibody antigen interaction but is    fold lower still         m for unassembled capsid protein dimers the latter observation indicates that both of the observed interactions are required to achieve stable binding of capsids by this receptor immunoglobulin considerations of conserved sequence motifs in other such molecules suggest that other na ve b cells may interact with hbv capsids in much the same way
