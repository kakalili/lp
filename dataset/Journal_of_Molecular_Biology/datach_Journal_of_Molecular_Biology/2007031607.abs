crystallographic and mutational studies of mycobacterium tuberculosis reca mini inteins suggest a pivotal role for a highly conserved aspartate residue
the   amino acid mtu reca intein consists of independent protein splicing and endonuclease domains previously removal of the central endonuclease domain of the intein and selection for function generated a   residue mini intein  i sm that had splicing activity similar to that of the full length wild type protein a d  g mutation  i cm increased c terminal cleavage activity using the  i sm mini intein structure presented here as a guide we previously generated a highly active   residue mini intein   ihh sm by replacing  amino acid residues in the residual endonuclease loop with a seven residue  turn from the autoprocessing domain of hedgehog protein the three dimensional structures of  i sm   ihh sm and two variants   ihh cm and   ihh have been determined to evaluate the effects of the minimization on intein integrity and to investigate the structural and functional consequences of the d  g mutation these structural studies show that asp  is capable of interacting with both the n and c termini these interactions are lacking in the cm variant but are replaced by contacts with water molecules accordingly additional mutagenesis of residue   combined with mutations that isolate n terminal and c terminal cleavage showed that the side chain of asp  plays a role in both n and c terminal cleavage thereby suggesting that this highly conserved residue regulates the balance between the two reactions
