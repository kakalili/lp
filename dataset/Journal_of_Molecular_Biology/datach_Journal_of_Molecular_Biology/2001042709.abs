the two active site tyrosine residues of the a protein play non equivalent roles during initiation of rolling circle replication of bacteriophage p  edited by m gottesman
the a protein of bacteriophage p initiates rolling circle dna replication by a single stranded cut at the origin two well conserved tyrosine residues interspaced by three amino acid residues are required for the cleavage joining activity of the protein the functional relationship between these tyrosine residues was investigated by site directed mutagenesis we found that the two tyrosine residues located in the presumed catalytic site of p a play non equivalent functional roles tyrosine residue   is superior in nicking single stranded dna compared to tyrosine residue   while both could promote joining at equal efficiency specific peptide oligonucleotide adducts after cleavage reaction and protease digestion could be observed for both tyrosine residues we propose that tyrosine   initiates replication and that tyrosine   is able to cleave the dna only when tyrosine   is covalently joined to dna thereby reinitiating replication also the involvement of divalent cations in the catalytic activity of p a was investigated while the cleavage reaction was strongly discriminating between different divalent cations primarily prefering magnesium the joining reaction showed the same efficiency independently of what divalent cation was provided this phenomenon could reflect conformational changes of the protein upon binding to dna finally we found that a large part of the c terminus but not the n terminus is dispensable for initiation of replication both in vivo and in vitro
