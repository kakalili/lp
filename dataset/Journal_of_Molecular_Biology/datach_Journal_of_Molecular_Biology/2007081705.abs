conformational properties of aggregated polypeptides determine clpb dependence in the disaggregation process
severe thermal stress induces massive intracellular protein aggregation the concerted action of hsp  dnak dnaj grpe and hsp   clpb chaperones results in solubilization of aggregates followed by reactivation of proteins it was shown that the hsp  chaperone system works at the initial step of the disaggregation reaction and is able to disentangle polypeptides from aggregates studies of the protein disaggregation reaction performed in vitro showed that clpb may be dispensable in disaggregation of certain proteins and or aggregates of certain size here we focus our attention on those properties of firefly luciferase aggregates which determine whether clpb chaperone is required in the disaggregation process we report that the size of the aggregates is not a major determinant instead we postulate that certain conformational properties in particular beta structures of subunits forming these aggregates are the most important factor determining the necessity of the clpb chaperone in the disaggregation process
