high throughput analysis of the protein sequence  stability landscape using a quantitative yeast surface two hybrid system and fragment reconstitution
stability evaluation of many mutants can lead to a better understanding of the sequence determinants of a structural motif and of factors governing protein stability and protein evolution the traditional biophysical analysis of protein stability is low throughput limiting our ability to widely explore sequence space in a quantitative manner in this study we have developed a high throughput library screening method for quantifying stability changes which is based on protein fragment reconstitution and yeast surface display our method exploits the thermodynamic linkage between protein stability and fragment reconstitution and the ability of the yeast surface display technique to quantitatively evaluate protein  protein interactions the method was applied to a fibronectin type iii fn  domain characterization of fragment reconstitution was facilitated by the co expression of two fn fragments thus establishing a yeast surface two hybrid method importantly our method does not rely on competition between clones and thus eliminates a common limitation of high throughput selection methods in which the most stable variants are recovered predominantly thus it allows for the isolation of sequences that exhibit a desired level of stability we identified more than   unique sequences for a  bulge motif which was significantly more informative than natural sequences of the fn family in revealing the sequence determinants for the  bulge our method provides a powerful means for the rapid assessment of the stability of many variants for the systematic assessment of the contribution of different factors to protein stability and for enhancement of the protein stability
