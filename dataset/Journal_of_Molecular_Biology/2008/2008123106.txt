H1 and HMGB1 bind to linker DNA in chromatin, in the vicinity of the nucleosome dyad. They appear to have opposing effects on the nucleosome, H1 stabilising it by ”sealing” two turns of DNA around the octamer, and HMGB1 destabilising it, probably by bending the adjacent DNA. Their presence in chromatin might be mutually exclusive. Displacement/replacement of one by the other as a result of their highly dynamic binding in vivo might, in principle, involve interactions between them. Chemical cross-linking and gel-filtration show that a 1:1 linker histone/HMGB1 complex is formed, which persists at physiological ionic strength, and that complex formation requires the acidic tail of HMGB1. NMR spectroscopy shows that the linker histone binds, predominantly through its basic C-terminal domain, to the acidic tail of HMGB1, thereby disrupting the interaction of the tail with the DNA-binding faces of the HMG boxes. A potential consequence of this interaction is enhanced DNA binding by HMGB1, and concomitantly lowered affinity of H1 for DNA. In a chromatin context, this might facilitate displacement of H1 by HMGB1.
