crystal structures of nods n methyltransferase from bradyrhizobium japonicum in ligand free form and as sah complex
nods is an s adenosyl l methionine sam dependent n methyltransferase that is involved in the biosynthesis of nod factor nf in rhizobia which are bacterial symbionts of legume plants nf is a modified chitooligosaccharide cos signal molecule that is recognized by the legume host where it initiates symbiotic processes leading to atmospheric nitrogen fixation we report the crystal structure of recombinant nods protein from bradyrhizobium japonicum which infects lupine and serradella legumes two crystal forms  ligand free nods and nods in complex with s adenosyl l homocysteine which is a by product of the methylation reaction  were obtained and their structures were refined to resolutions of     and      respectively although the overall fold consisting of a seven stranded  sheet flanked by layers of helices is similar to those of other sam dependent methyltransferases nods has specific features reflecting the unique character of its oligosaccharide substrate in particular the n terminal helix and its connecting loop get ordered upon sam binding thereby closing the methyl donor cavity and shaping a long surface canyon that is clearly the binding site for the acceptor molecule comparison of the two structural forms of nods suggests that there are also other conformational changes taking place upon the binding of the donor substrate as an enzyme that methylates a cos substrate nods is the first example among all sam dependent methyltransferases to have its three dimensional structure elucidated gaining insight about how nods binds its donor and acceptor substrates helps to better understand the mechanism of nods activity and the basis of its functional difference in various rhizobia
