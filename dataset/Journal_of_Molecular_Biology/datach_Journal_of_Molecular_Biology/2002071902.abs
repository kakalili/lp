proteins with class    fold have high level participation in fusion events
now that complete genome sequences are available for a variety of organisms the elucidation of potential gene products function is a central goal in the post genome era domain fusion analysis has been proposed recently to infer the functional association of the component proteins here we took a new approach to the analysis of the structural features of the proteins involved in fusion events an exhaustive survey of fusion events within  completely sequenced genomes and subsequent structure annotations to the component proteins at a scop superfamily level with hidden markov models was carried out a domain fusion map was then constructed the results revealed that proteins with the class    fold are frequently involved in fusion events around   of the total   assigned single domain fusion pairs including at least one component protein belonging to the    fold class moreover the domain fusion map in our work may offer an attractive framework for designing chimeric enzymes following nature s lead and may give useful hints for exploring the evolutionary history of proteins
