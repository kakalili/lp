atp dependent roles of the dead box protein mss  p in group ii intron splicing in vitro and in vivo
the yeast dead box protein mss  p functions as a general rna chaperone in splicing mitochondrial group i and group ii introns for most of its functions mss  p is thought to use atp dependent rna unwinding to facilitate rna structural transitions but it has been suggested to assist in the folding of one group ii intron ai   primarily by stabilizing a folding intermediate here we compare three ai  constructs one with long exons one with short exons and a ribozyme construct lacking exons the long exons result in slower splicing suggesting that they misfold and or stabilize nonnative intronic structures nevertheless mss  p acceleration of all three constructs depends on atp and is inhibited by mutations that compromise rna unwinding suggesting similar mechanisms results of splicing assays and a new two stage assay that separates ribozyme folding and catalysis indicate that maximal folding of all three constructs by mss  p requires atp dependent rna unwinding atp independent activation is appreciable for only a subpopulation of the minimal ribozyme construct and not for constructs containing exons as expected for a general rna chaperone mss  p can also disrupt the native ribozyme which can refold after mss  p removal finally using yeast strains with mitochondrial dna containing only the single intron ai    we show that mss  p mutants promote splicing in vivo to degrees that correlate with their residual atp dependent rna unwinding activities together our results indicate that although dead box proteins play multiple roles in rna folding the physiological function of mss  p in ai  splicing includes a requirement for atp dependent local unfolding allowing the conversion of nonfunctional rna structure into functional rna structure
