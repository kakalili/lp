a small synthetic peptide which inhibits the p  hdm interaction stimulates the p  pathway in tumour cell lines edited by a r fersht
the hdm protein negatively regulates p  tumour suppressor activity upon binding to p  hdm stimulates p  degradation and inhibits its transcriptional activity moreover the hdm protein is overexpressed in various tumours inactivating p  we report here that an octamer synthetic peptide derived from p  inhibits the p  hdm interaction in vitro in cellular assays this untagged peptide penetrates tumour cells and induces the accumulation of p  the accumulation of p  leads to its activation two gene products transcriptionally regulated by p  p waf cip and hdm  are induced in the presence of the peptide when used with tumour cells that overexpress hdm  the peptide induces the death of these tumour cells by apoptosis the mode of action of this peptide differs from that of dna damaging agents e g cisplatin in that it does not induce p  phosphorylation on serine   this work validates with a low molecular mass molecule our current knowledge on the regulation of the p  pathway by the hdm protein it also shows that inhibitors of the p  hdm interaction are very attractive candidates for the activation of the p  pathway in tumours expressing wild type p
