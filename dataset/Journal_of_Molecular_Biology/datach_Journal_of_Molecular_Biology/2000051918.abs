topological and energetic factors what determines the structural details of the transition state ensemble and  en route  intermediates for protein folding an investigation for small globular proteins edited by f e cohen
recent experimental results suggest that the native fold or topology plays a primary role in determining the structure of the transition state ensemble at least for small fast folding proteins to investigate the extent of the topological control of the folding process we studied the folding of simplified models of five small globular proteins constructed using a go like potential to retain the information about the native structures but drastically reduce the energetic frustration and energetic heterogeneity among residue residue native interactions by comparing the structure of the transition state ensemble experimentally determined by  values and of the intermediates with those obtained using our models we show that these energetically unfrustrated models can reproduce the global experimentally known features of the transition state ensembles and  en route  intermediates at least for the analyzed proteins this result clearly indicates that as long as the protein sequence is sufficiently minimally frustrated topology plays a central role in determining the folding mechanism
