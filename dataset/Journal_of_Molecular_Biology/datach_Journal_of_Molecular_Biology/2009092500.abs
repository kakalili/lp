epigallocatechin  gallate egcg maintains  casein in its pre fibrillar state without redirecting its aggregation pathway
the polyphenol    epigallocatechin  gallate egcg has recently attracted much research interest in the field of protein misfolding diseases because of its potent anti amyloid activity against amyloid    synuclein and huntingtin the amyloid fibril forming proteins involved in alzheimer s parkinson s and huntington s diseases respectively egcg redirects the aggregation of these polypeptides to a disordered off folding pathway that results in the formation of non toxic amorphous aggregates whether this anti fibril activity is specific to these disease related target proteins or is more generic remains to be established in addition the mechanism by which egcg exerts its effects as with all anti amyloidogenic polyphenols remains unclear to address these aspects we have investigated the ability of egcg to inhibit amyloidogenesis of the generic model fibril forming protein rcm  cn reduced and carboxymethylated  casein and thereby protect pheochromocytoma  cells from rcm  cn amyloid induced toxicity we found that egcg potently inhibits in vitro fibril formation by rcm  cn the ic  for    m rcm  cn is     m  biophysical studies reveal that egcg prevents rcm  cn fibril formation by stabilising rcm  cn in its native like state rather than by redirecting its aggregation to the disordered amorphous aggregation pathway thus while it appears that egcg is a generic inhibitor of amyloid fibril formation the mechanism by which it achieves this inhibition is specific to the target fibril forming polypeptide it is proposed that egcg is directed to the amyloidogenic sheet  turn  sheet motif of monomeric rcm  cn with high affinity by strong non specific hydrophobic associations additional non covalent     stacking interactions between the polyphenolic and aromatic residues common to the amyloidogenic sequence are also implicated
