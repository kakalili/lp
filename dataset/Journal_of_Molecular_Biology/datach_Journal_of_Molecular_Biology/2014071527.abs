novel interaction of the z dna binding domain of human adar with the oncogenic c myc promoter g quadruplex
both g quadruplex and z dna can be formed in g rich and repetitive sequences on genome and their formation and biological functions are controlled by specific proteins z dna binding proteins such as human adar  have a highly conserved z dna binding domain having selective affinity to z dna here our study identifies the z dna binding domain of human adar  hz adar  as a novel g quadruplex binding protein that recognizes c myc promoter g quadruplex formed in nheiii region and represses the gene expression an electrophoretic migration shift assay shows the binding of hz adar to the intramolecular c myc promoter g quadruplex forming dna oligomer to corroborate the binding of hz adar to the g quadruplex we conducted cd and nmr chemical shift perturbation analyses cd results indicate that hz adar stabilizes the parallel stranded conformation of the c myc g quadruplex the nmr chemical shift perturbation data reveal that the g quadruplex binding region in hz adar was almost identical with the z dna binding region finally promoter assay and western blot analysis show that hz adar suppresses the c myc expression promoted by nheiii region containing the g quadruplex forming sequence this finding suggests a novel function of z dna binding protein as a regulator of g quadruplex mediated gene expression
