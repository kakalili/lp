a glucose response element from the s cerevisiae hexose transporter hxt gene is sensitive to glucose in human fibroblasts
glucose is an essential nutrient and a regulator of gene expression in eukaryotic cells here a comparative function based genomic approach has been used to identify glucose regulatory elements and transduction pathways common to both yeast and mammalian cells we have isolated a region in the promoter of the saccharomyces cerevisiae hexose transporter gene hxt that conferred glucose sensitivity in yeast when located upstream of the minimal cyc promoter this element contained binding motifs for rgt  a transcriptional modulator involved in the yeast glucose induction pathway that were sufficient to elicit glucose responsiveness the hxt regulatory element was then fused to the minimal cytomegalovirus promoter hxt min and inserted into an adenovirus for delivery to human fibroblasts where it exhibited glucose dependent transcriptional activation glucose action was mimicked by fructose and unrelated to glucose  p content whilst non metabolizable glucose analogues showed no effect activation of amp kinase by  aminoimidazole  carboxamide   d ribofuranosanide blocked glucose induction revealing parallels with the yeast glucose repressing pathway in contrast delivery of rgt to fibroblasts did not modify hxt min responsiveness thus elements of the s cerevisiae hxt gene conserve glucose regulation in human fibroblasts equivalent to the metabolism dependent glucose repressing pathway in yeast these data suggest that the instructions carried within gene regulatory elements controlling nutrient regulation of gene expression have been conserved throughout evolution
