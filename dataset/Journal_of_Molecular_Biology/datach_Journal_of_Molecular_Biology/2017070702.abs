intracellular domain contacts contribute to ecadherin constitutive dimerization in the plasma membrane
epithelial cadherin ecadherin is responsible for the intercellular cohesion of epithelial tissues it forms lateral clusters within adherens cell  cell junctions but its association state outside these clusters is unknown here we use a quantitative forster resonance energy transfer fret approach to show that ecadherin forms constitutive dimers and that these dimers exist independently of the actin cytoskeleton or cytoplasmic proteins the dimers are stabilized by intermolecular contacts that occur along the entire length of ecadherin with the intracellular domains having a surprisingly strong favorable contribution we further show that ecadherin mutations and calcium depletion induce structural alterations that propagate from the n terminus all the way to the c terminus without destabilizing the dimeric state these findings provide context for the interpretation of ecadherin adhesion experiments they also suggest that early events of adherens junction assembly involve interactions between from preformed ecadherin dimers
