binding sub site dissection of a carbohydrate binding module reveals the contribution of entropy to oligosaccharide recognition at  non primary  binding subsites
the optimal ligands for many carbohydrate binding proteins are often oligosaccharides comprising two three or more monosaccharide units the binding affinity for these sugars is increased incrementally by contributions from binding subsites on the protein that accommodate the individual monosaccharide residues of the oligosaccharide here we use cscbm   a xylan specific type b carbohydrate binding module cbm from clostridium stercorarium falling into amino acid sequence family cbm  as a model system to investigate the structural and thermodynamic contributions of binding subsites in this protein to carbohydrate recognition the three dimensional structures of uncomplexed cscbm   at    resolution and bound to the oligosaccharides xylobiose xylotriose and xylotetraose at         and    resolution respectively revealed the sequential occupation of four subsites within the binding site in the order of subsites     then  overall binding to all of the xylooligosaccharides tested was enthalpically favourable and entropically unfavourable like most protein  carbohydrate interactions with the primary subsites  and  providing the bulk of the free energy and enthalpy of binding in contrast the contributions to the changes in entropy of the non primary subsites  and  to xylotriose and xylotetraose binding respectively were positive this observation is remarkable in that it shows that the     fold improvement in association constants for oligosaccharides longer than a disaccharide is facilitated by favourable entropic contributions from the non primary binding subsites
