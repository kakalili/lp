is  phosphoglycerate dependent automodification of bacterial enolases implicated in their export
we observed that in vivo and in vitro a small fraction of the glycolytic enzyme enolase became covalently modified by its substrate  phosphoglycerate  pg  in modified escherichia coli enolase  pg was bound to lys   which is located in the active site an identical reversible modification was observed with other bacterial enolases but also with enolase from saccharomyces cerevisiae and rabbit muscle an equivalent of lys   which plays an important role in catalysis is present in enolase of all organisms covalent binding of  pg to this amino acid rendered the enzyme inactive replacement of lys  of e coli enolase with other amino acids prevented the automodification and in most cases strongly reduced the activity as reported for other bacteria a significant fraction of e coli enolase was found to be exported into the medium interestingly all lys  substitutions prevented not only the automodification but also the export of enolase the k  e mutant enolase was almost as active as the wild type enzyme and therefore allowed us to establish that the loss of enolase export correlates with the loss of modification and not the loss of glycolytic activity
