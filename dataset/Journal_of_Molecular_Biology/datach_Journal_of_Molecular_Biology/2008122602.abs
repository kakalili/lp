the crystal structure of enamidase a bifunctional enzyme of the nicotinate catabolism
the hydrolysis of     tetrahydro  oxonicotinate to  formylglutarate is a central step in the catabolism of nicotinate in several clostridia and proteobacteria this reaction is catalyzed by the novel enzyme enamidase a new member of the amidohydrolase superfamily as indicated by its unique reaction sequence relationship and the stoichiometric binding of iron and zinc a hallmark of enamidase is its capability to catalyze a two step reaction the initial decyclization of     tetrahydro  oxonicotinate leading to  enamine glutarate followed by an additional hydrolysis step yielding s  formylglutarate here we present the crystal structure of enamidase from eubacterium barkeri at     resolution providing a structural basis for catalysis and suggesting a mechanism for its exceptional activity and enantioselectivity the enzyme forms a   symmetric tetramer built up by a dimer of dimers each enamidase monomer consists of a composite  sandwich domain and an     tim barrel domain harboring the active site with its catalytic binuclear metal center comprising both zinc and iron ions enamidase represents a special case of subtype ii amidohydrolases
