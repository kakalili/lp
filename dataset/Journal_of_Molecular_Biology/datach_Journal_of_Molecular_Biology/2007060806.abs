evidence for dynamic interplay of different oligomeric states of udp n acetylglucosamine  epimerase n acetylmannosamine kinase by biophysical methods
the bifunctional enzyme udp n acetylglucosamine  epimerase n acetylmannosamine kinase gne is a key enzyme for the biosynthesis of sialic acids the terminal sugars of glycoconjugates associated with a variety of physiological and pathological processes such as cell adhesion development inflammation and cancer in this study we characterized rat gne by different biophysical methods analytical ultracentrifugation dynamic light scattering and size exclusion chromatography all revealing the native hydrodynamic behavior and molar mass of the protein we show that gne is able to reversibly self associate into different oligomeric states including monomers dimers and tetramers additionally it forms non specific aggregates of high molecular mass which cannot be unequivocally assigned a distinct size our results also indicate that ligands of the epimerase domain of the bifunctional enzyme namely udp n acetylglucosamine and cmp n acetylneuraminic acid stabilize the protein against aggregation and are capable of modulating the quaternary structure of the protein the presence of udp n acetylglucosamine strongly favors the tetrameric state which therefore likely represents the active state of the enzyme in cells
