single molecule studies reveal that dead box protein ddx promotes oligomerization of hiv  rev on the rev response element
oligomeric assembly of rev on the rev response element rre is essential for the nuclear export of unspliced and singly spliced human immunodeficiency virus type  viral mrna transcripts several host factors including the human dead box protein ddx  are also known to be required for efficient rev function in this study spontaneous assembly and dissociation of individual rev  rre complexes in the presence or absence of ddx were observed in real time via single molecule total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy binding of up to eight fluorescently labeled rev monomers to a single rre molecule was visualized and the event frequencies and corresponding binding and dissociation rates for the different rev  rre stoichiometries were determined the presence of ddx eliminated a second kinetic phase present during the initial rev binding step attributed to nonproductive nucleation events resulting in increased occurrence of higher order rev  rre stoichiometries this effect was further enhanced upon the addition of a non hydrolyzable atp analog adenylyl imidophosphate  whereas adp had no effect beyond that of ddx alone notably the first three rev monomer binding events were accelerated in the presence of ddx and adenylyl imidophosphate while the dissociation rates remained unchanged measurements performed across a range of ddx concentrations suggest that ddx targets rev rather than the rre to promote oligomeric assembly moreover ddx is able to restore the oligomerization activity of a rev mutant that is otherwise unable to assemble on the rre beyond a monomeric complex taken together these results suggest that ddx acts as a cellular cofactor by promoting oligomerization of rev on the rre
