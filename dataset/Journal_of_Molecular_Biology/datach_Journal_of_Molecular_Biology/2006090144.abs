bacteriophage t structure reveals similarities with hk  and t suggesting evolutionary relationships
evolutionary relationships between viruses may be obscure by protein sequence but unmasked by structure analysis of bacteriophage t by cryo electron microscopy and protein sequence analysis reveals analogies with hk  and t that suggest a mosaic of such connections the t capsid is consistent with the hk  capsid protein fold but has a different geometry incorporating three additional hexamers on each icosahedral facet similarly to hk  the t major capsid protein has an n terminal extension or  domain that is missing in the mature capsid and by analogy with hk  may function as an assembly or scaffold domain this  domain is predicted to be largely coiled coil as for that of hk  but is    longer correlating with the larger capsid thus capsid architecture appears likely to be specified by the  domain unlike hk  the t capsid binds a decoration protein in the center of each hexamer similarly to the  hoc  protein of phage t  suggesting a common role for these molecules the tail tube has unusual trimeric symmetry that may aid in the unique two stage dna ejection process and joins the tail tip at a disk where tail fibers attach this intriguing mix of characteristics embodied by phage t offers insights into virus assembly subunit function and the evolutionary connections between related viruses
