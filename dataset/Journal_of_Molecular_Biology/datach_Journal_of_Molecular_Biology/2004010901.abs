dephosphorylation of rna polymerase ii by ctd phosphatase fcp is inhibited by phospho ctd associating proteins
reversible phosphorylation of the repetitive c terminal domain ctd of the largest rna polymerase rnap ii subunit plays a key role in the progression of rnap through the transcription cycle the level of ctd phosphorylation is determined by multiple ctd kinases and a ctd phosphatase fcp  the phosphorylated ctd binds to a variety of proteins including the cis trans peptidyl prolyl isomerase ppiase pin and enzymes involved in processing of the primary transcript such as the capping enzyme hce and ca   a nuclear factor implicated in transcription elongation results presented here establish that the dephosphorylation of hyperphosphorylated rnap ii rnap iio by fcp is impaired in the presence of pin or hce  whereas ca  has no influence on fcp activity the inhibition of dephosphorylation is observed with free rnap iio generated by different ctd kinases as well as with rnap iio engaged in an elongation complex these findings support the idea that specific phospho ctd associating proteins can differentially modulate the dephosphorylation of rnap iio by steric hindrance and may play an important role in the regulation of gene expression
