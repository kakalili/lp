two amyloid states of the prion protein display significantly different folding patterns
it has been well established that a single amino acid sequence can give rise to several conformationally distinct amyloid states the extent to which amyloid structures formed within the same sequence are different however remains unclear to address this question we studied two amyloid states referred to as r and s fibrils produced in vitro from highly purified full length recombinant prion protein several biophysical techniques including x ray diffraction cd fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir  hydrogen  deuterium exchange proteinase k digestion and binding of a conformation sensitive fluorescence dye revealed that r and s fibrils have substantially different secondary tertiary and quaternary structures while both states displayed a     meridional x ray diffraction typical for amyloid cross  spines they showed markedly different equatorial profiles suggesting different folding pattern of  strands the experiments on hydrogen  deuterium exchange monitored by ftir revealed that only small fractions of amide protons were protected in r or s fibrils an argument for the dynamic nature of their cross  structure despite this fact both amyloid states were found to be very stable conformationally as judged from temperature induced denaturation monitored by ftir and the conformation sensitive dye upon heating to    c only local unfolding was revealed while individual state specific cross  features were preserved the current studies demonstrated that the two amyloid states formed by the same amino acid sequence exhibited significantly different folding patterns that presumably reflect two different architectures of cross  structure both s and r fibrils however shared high conformational stability arguing that the energy landscape for protein folding and aggregation can contain several deep free energy minima
