the transition like state and pi entrance into the catalytic a subunit of the biological engine a atp synthase
archaeal a atp synthases catalyze the formation of the energy currency atp the chemical mechanisms of atp synthesis in a atp synthases are unknown we have determined the crystal structure of a transition like state of the vanadate bound form of catalytic subunit a avi of the a atp synthase from pyrococcus horikoshii ot  two orthovanadate molecules were observed in the avi structure one of which interacts with the phosphate binding loop through residue s   the second vanadate is positioned in the transient binding site implicating for the first time the pathway for phosphate entry to the catalytic site moreover since residues k  and t  are proposed to be essential for catalysis the mutant structures of k  a and t  a were also determined the results demonstrate the importance of these two residues for transition state stabilization the structures presented shed light on the diversity of catalytic mechanisms used by the biological motors a and f atp synthases and eukaryotic v atpases
