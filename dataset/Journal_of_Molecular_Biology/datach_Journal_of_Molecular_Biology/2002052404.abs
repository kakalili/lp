measuring dynamic flexibility of the coil state of a helix forming peptide
to investigate the dynamic flexibility of the coil state of a helix forming peptide the end to end contact rate was determined nanosecond optical excitation of tryptophan at one end of a  residue alanine peptide populates a long lived triplet state which is quenched upon close contact with a cyclic disulfide attached to the opposite end analysis of the decay of the triplet population using a two state model for helix formation yields the diffusion limited end to end contact rate of the coil state of the peptide as well as the helix  coil and coil  helix rates the helix  coil rates are very similar to those previously measured in laser temperature jump experiments the end to end contact rate of     s   in the coil state is tenfold faster than the rate for a disordered peptide with threonine substituted for alanine and somewhat surprisingly is about twice the rate for a disordered glycine containing peptide these differences are discussed in terms of the theory of szabo schulten and schulten the rates should provide important new benchmarks for testing the accuracy of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations
