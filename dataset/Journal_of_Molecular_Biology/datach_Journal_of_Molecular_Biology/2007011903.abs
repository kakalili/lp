structural and kinetic studies of induced fit in xylulose kinase from escherichia coli
the primary metabolic route for d xylose the second most abundant sugar in nature is via the pentose phosphate pathway after a two step or three step conversion to xylulose  phosphate xylulose kinase xk ec      phosphorylates d xylulose the last step in this conversion the apo and d xylulose bound crystal structures of escherichia coli xk have been determined and show a dimer composed of two domains separated by an open cleft xk dimerization was observed directly by a cryo em reconstruction at    resolution kinetic studies reveal that xk has a weak substrate independent mgatp hydrolyzing activity and phosphorylates several sugars and polyols with low catalytic efficiency binding of pentulose and mgatp to form the reactive ternary complex is strongly synergistic although the steady state kinetic mechanism of xk is formally random a path is preferred in which d xylulose binds before mgatp modelling of mgatp binding to xk and the accompanying conformational change suggests that sugar binding is accompanied by a dramatic hinge bending movement that enhances interactions with mgatp explaining the observed synergism a catalytic mechanism is proposed and supported by relevant site directed mutants
