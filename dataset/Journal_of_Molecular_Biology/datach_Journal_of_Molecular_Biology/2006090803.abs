viral fitness can influence the repertoire of virus variants selected by antibodies
minority genomes in the mutant spectra of viral quasispecies may differ in relative fitness here we report experiments designed to evaluate the contribution of relative fitness to selection by a neutralizing monoclonal antibody mab  we have reconstructed a foot and mouth disease virus fmdv quasispecies with two matched pairs of distinguishable mab escape mutants as minority genomes of the mutant spectrum each mutant of a pair differs from the other by  fold or  fold in relative fitness analysis of the mutant spectra of virus populations selected with different concentrations of antibody in infections in liquid culture medium has documented a dominance of the high fitness counterpart in the selected population plaque development as a function of increasing concentration of the antibody has shown that each mutant of a matched pair yielded the same number of plaques although the high fitness mutant required less time for plaque formation and attained a larger plaque size at any given time point this result documents equal intrinsic resistance to the antibody of each mutant of a matched pair confirming previous biochemical structural and genetic studies which indicated that the epitopes of each mutant pair were indistinguishable regarding reactivity with the monoclonal antibody thus relative viral fitness can influence in a significant way the repertoire of viral mutants selected from a viral quasispecies by a neutralizing antibody we discuss the significance of these results in relation to antibody selection and to other selective forces likely encountered by viral quasispecies in vivo
