crystal structure of r  g disease mutant of human  b crystallin domain dimer shows closure of a groove
small heat shock proteins form large cytosolic assemblies from an    crystallin domain   acd flanked by sequence extensions mutation of a conserved arginine in the acd of several human small heat shock protein family members causes many common inherited diseases of the lens and neuromuscular system the mutation r  g in  b crystallin causes myopathy cardiomyopathy and cataract we have solved the x ray structure of the excised acd dimer of human  b r  g close to physiological ph and compared it with several recently determined wild type vertebrate acd dimer structures wild type excised acd dimers have a deep groove at the interface floored by a flat extended  bottom sheet   solid state nmr studies of large assemblies of full length  b crystallin have shown that the groove is blocked in the acd dimer by curvature of the bottom sheet the crystal structure of r  g acd dimer also reveals a closed groove but here the bottom sheet is flat loss of arg  results in rearrangement of an extensive array of charged interactions across this interface his  and asp  on movable arches on either side of the interface close the groove by forming two new salt bridges the residues involved in this extended set of ionic interactions are conserved in hsp  hsp   a and  b crystallin sequences they are not conserved in hsp  where mutation of the equivalent of arg  causes neuropathy we speculate that the  b r  g mutation disturbs oligomer dynamics causing the growth of large soluble oligomers that are toxic to cells by blocking essential processes
