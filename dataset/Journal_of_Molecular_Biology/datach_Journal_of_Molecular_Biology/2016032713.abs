multiple weak linear motifs enhance recruitment and processivity in spop mediated substrate ubiquitination
primary sequence motifs with millimolar affinities for binding partners are abundant in disordered protein regions in multivalent interactions such weak linear motifs can cooperate to recruit binding partners via avidity effects if linear motifs recruit modifying enzymes optimal placement of weak motifs may regulate access to modification sites weak motifs may thus exert physiological relevance stronger than that suggested by their affinities but molecular mechanisms of their function are still poorly understood herein we use the n terminal disordered region of the hedgehog transcriptional regulator gli  gli    to determine the role of weak motifs encoded in its primary sequence for the recruitment of its ubiquitin ligase crl spop and the subsequent effect on ubiquitination efficiency the substrate adaptor spop binds linear motifs through its math meprin and traf homology domain and forms higher order oligomers through its oligomerization domains rendering spop multivalent for its substrates gli has multiple weak spop binding motifs we map three such motifs in gli    the weakest of which has a millimolar dissociation constant multivalency of ligase and substrate for each other facilitates enhanced ligase recruitment and stimulates gli   ubiquitination in in vitro ubiquitination assays we speculate that the weak motifs enable processivity through avidity effects and by providing steric access to lysine residues that are otherwise not prioritized for polyubiquitination weak motifs may generally be employed in multivalent systems to act as gatekeepers regulating post translational modification
