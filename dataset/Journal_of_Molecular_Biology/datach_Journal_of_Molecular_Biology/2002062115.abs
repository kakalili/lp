ions and counterions in a biological channel a molecular dynamics simulation of ompf porin from escherichia coli in an explicit membrane with m kcl aqueous salt solution
a ns all atom molecular dynamics trajectory of escherichia coli ompf porin embedded in an explicit dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine dmpc bilayer bathed by a m kcl aqueous salt solution is generated to explore the microscopic details of the mechanism of ion permeation the atomic model includes the ompf trimer   dmpc    water molecules as well as   k and   cl   for a total of    atoms the structural and dynamical results are in excellent agreement with the x ray data the global root mean square deviation of the backbone atoms relative to the x ray structure is    a cluster of three fully charged arginine arg  arg  and arg   facing two acidic residues asp  and glu   on l in the narrowest part of the aqueous pore is observed to be very stable in the crystallographic conformation in this region of the pore the water molecules are markedly oriented perpendicular to the channel axis due to the strong transversal electrostatic field arising from those residues on average the size of the pore is smaller during the simulation than in the x ray structure undergoing small fluctuations no large movements of loop l leading to a gating of the pore are observed remarkably it is observed that k and cl  follow two well separated average pathways spanning over nearly   along the axis of the pore in the center of the monomer the two screw like pathways have a left handed twist undergoing a counter clockwise rotation of    from the extracellular vestibule to the pore periplasmic side in the pore the dynamical diffusion constants of the ions are reduced by about   relative to their value in bulk solvent analysis of ion solvation across the channel reveals that the contributions from the water and the protein are complementary keeping the total solvation number of both ions nearly constant unsurprisingly k have a higher propensity to occupy the aqueous pore than cl   consistent with the cation selectivity of the channel however further analysis suggests that ion  ion pairs play an important role in particular it is observed that the passage of cl  occurs only in the presence of k counterions and isolated k can move through the channel and permeate on their own the presence of k in the pore screens the negative electrostatic potential arising from ompf to help the translocation of cl  by formation of ion pairs
