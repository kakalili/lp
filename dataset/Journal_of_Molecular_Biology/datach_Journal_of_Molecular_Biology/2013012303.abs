n terminal phosphorylation of p  katanin directly regulates microtubule severing
proteins of the aaa atpases associated with various cellular activities family often have complex modes of regulation due to their central position in important cellular processes p  katanin an aaa protein that severs and depolymerizes microtubules is subject to multiple modes of regulation including a phosphorylation in the n terminal domain involved in mitotic control of severing phosphorylation decreases severing activity in xenopus egg extracts and is involved in controlling spindle length here we show that the evolutionarily divergent n terminal domains of p  have maintained hotspots of mitotic kinase regulation by reconstituting in vitro severing reactions we show that phosphomimetic modification at amino acid position   in xenopus laevis p  decreases severing and microtubule stimulated atpase activity without affecting the binding affinity of p  for microtubules at high concentrations of the phosphomimetic mutant p  wild type levels of activity could be observed indicating a more switch like threshold of activity that is controlled by regulating oligomerization on the microtubule this provides a cellular mechanism for high local concentrations of p  like those found on spindle poles to maintain severing activity while most of the protein is inhibited overall we have shown that the modular domain architecture of aaa proteins allows for precise control of cellular activities with simple modifications
