gradual folding of an off pathway molten globule detected at the single molecule level
molten globules mgs are compact partially folded intermediates that are transiently present during folding of many proteins these intermediates reside on or off the folding pathway to native protein conformational evolution during folding of off pathway mgs is largely unexplored here we characterize the denaturant dependent structure of apoflavodoxin s off pathway mg using single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer smfret  we follow conversion of unfolded species into mg down to denaturant concentrations that favor formation of native protein under strongly denaturing conditions fluorescence resonance energy transfer histograms show a single peak arising from unfolded protein the smfret efficiency distribution shifts to higher value upon decreasing denaturant concentration because the mg folds strikingly upon approaching native conditions the fluorescence resonance energy transfer efficiency of the mg rises above that of native protein thus smfret exposes the misfolded nature of apoflavodoxin s off pathway mg we show that conversion of unfolded into mg protein is a gradual second order like process that simultaneously involves separate regions within the polypeptide
