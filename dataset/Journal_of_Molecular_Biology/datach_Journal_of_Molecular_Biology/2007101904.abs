active suppressor trnas with a double helix between the d and t loops
one of the most conserved elements of the trna structure is the reverse hoogsteen base pair t   a  in the t loop which plays a major role in the maintenance of the standard l shape conformation here we present the results of in vivo selection of  active suppressor trna clones none of which contains base pair t   a  in  clones we found two regions in the d and t loops that are complementary to each other this finding suggests the existence of an inter loop double helix consisting of three base pairs which could have the same role as base pair t   a  in the fixation of the juxtaposition of the two helical domains within the l shape from this point of view the appearance of the inter loop double helix represents a compensatory effect for the absence of base pair t   a  the results shed new light on the role of different elements of the trna structure in the formation of the standard l shape conformation and on the possibility of synonymous replacements of one arrangement by another in functional rna molecules
