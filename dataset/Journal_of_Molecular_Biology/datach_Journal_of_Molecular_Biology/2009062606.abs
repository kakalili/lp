different behaviors in vivo of mutations in the  hairpin loop of the dna polymerases of the closely related phages t and rb
the t and rb  dna replicative polymerases are members of the b family and are highly similar both replicate dna with high fidelity and employ the same mechanism that allows efficient switching of the primer terminus between the polymerase and exonuclease sites both polymerases have a  hairpin loop hereafter called the  loop in their exonuclease domains that plays an important role in active site switching the  loop is involved in strand separation and is needed to stabilize partially strand separated exonuclease complexes in t dna polymerase modification of the  loop residue g  to ser confers a strong mutator phenotype in vivo due to a reduced ability to form editing complexes here we describe the rb  dna polymerase mutant with the equivalent residue g   changed to ser but showing only mild mutator activity in vivo on the other hand deletion of the tip of the rb   loop confers a strong mutator phenotype in vivo based on detailed mutational spectral analyses dna binding activities and coupled polymerase exonuclease assays we define the differences between the t and rb  polymerases we propose that their  loops facilitate strand separation in both polymerases while the residues that form the loop have low structural constraints
