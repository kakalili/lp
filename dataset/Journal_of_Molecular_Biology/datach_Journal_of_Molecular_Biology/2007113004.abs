heterogeneity even at the speed limit of folding large scale molecular dynamics study of a fast folding variant of the villin headpiece
we have performed molecular dynamics simulations on a set of nine unfolded conformations of the fastest folding protein yet discovered a variant of the villin headpiece subdomain hp  nlenle  the simulations were generated using a new distributed computing method yielding hundreds of trajectories each on a time scale comparable to the experimental folding time despite the large     atom size of the simulation system this strategy eliminates the need to assume a two state kinetic model or to build a markov state model the relaxation to the folded state at   k from the unfolded configurations generated by simulation at   k was monitored by a method intended to reflect the experimental observable quenching of tryptophan by histidine  we also monitored the relaxation to the native state by directly comparing structural snapshots with the native state the rate of relaxation to the native state and the number of resolvable kinetic time scales both depend upon starting structure moreover starting structures with folding rates most similar to experiment show some native like structure in the n terminal helix helix  and the phenylalanine residues constituting the hydrophobic core suggesting that these elements may exist in the experimentally relevant unfolded state our large scale simulation data reveal kinetic complexity not resolved in the experimental data based on these findings we propose additional experiments to further probe the kinetics of villin folding
