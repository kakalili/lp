Like protein enzymes, catalytic RNAs contain conserved structure motifs important for function. A universal feature of the catalytic domain of ribonuclease P RNA is a bulged-helix motif within the P1â€“P4 helix junction. Here, we show that changes in bulged nucleotide identity and position within helix P4 affect both catalysis and substrate binding, while a subset of the mutations resulted only in catalytic defects. We find that the proximity of the bulge to sites of metal ion coordination in P4 is important for catalysis; moving the bulge distal to these sites and deleting it had similarly large effects, while moving it proximal to these sites had only a moderate effect on catalysis. To test whether the effects of the mutations are linked to metal ion interactions, we used terbium-dependent cleavage of the phosphate backbone to probe metal ion-binding sites in the wild-type and mutant ribozymes. We detect cleavages at specific sites within the catalytic domain, including helix P4 and J3/4, which have previously been shown to participate directly in metal ion interactions. Mutations introduced into P4 cause local changes in the terbium cleavage pattern due to alternate metal ion-binding configurations with the helix. In addition, a bulge deletion mutation results in a 100-fold decrease in the single turnover cleavage rate constant at saturating magnesium levels, and a reduced affinity for magnesium ions important for catalysis. In light of the alternate terbium cleavage pattern in P4 caused by bulge deletion, this decreased ability to utilize magnesium ions for catalysis appears to be due to localized structural changes in the ribozyme's catalytic core that weaken metal ion interactions in P4 and J3/4. The information reported here, therefore, provides evidence that the universal conservation of the P4 structure is based in part on optimization of metal ion interactions important for catalysis.
