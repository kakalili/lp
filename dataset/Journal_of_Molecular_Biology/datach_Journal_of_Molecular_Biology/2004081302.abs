solution structure and dna binding of the zinc finger domain from dna ligase iii
dna ligase iii  carries out the final ligation step in the base excision repair ber and single strand break repair ssbr mechanisms of dna repair the enzyme recognises single strand nicks and other damage features in double stranded dna both through the catalytic domain and an n terminal domain containing a single zinc finger the latter is homologous to other zinc fingers that recognise damaged dna two in the n terminus of poly adenosine ribose polymerase and three in the n terminus of the arabidopsis thaliana nick sensing dna   phosphoesterase here we present the solution structure of the zinc finger domain of human dna ligase iii  the first structure of a finger from this group it is related to that of the erythroid transcription factor gata  but has an additional n terminal  strand and c terminal  helix chemical shift mapping using a dna ligand containing a single stranded break showed that the dna binding surface of the dna ligase iii  zinc finger is substantially different from that of gata  consistent with the fact that the two proteins recognise very different features in the dna likely implications for dna binding are discussed
