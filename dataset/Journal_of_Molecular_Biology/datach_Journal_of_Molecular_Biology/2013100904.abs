the non coding b rna binds to the dna cleft and active site region of rna polymerase ii
the b family of short interspersed elements is transcribed into non coding rna by rna polymerase iii the   nt b rna has been shown to potently repress mrna transcription by binding tightly to rna polymerase ii pol ii and assembling with it into complexes on promoter dna where it keeps the polymerase from properly engaging the promoter dna mammalian pol ii is an   kda complex that contains  different protein subunits providing many possible surfaces for interaction with b rna we found that the carboxy terminal domain of the largest pol ii subunit was not required for b rna to bind pol ii and repress transcription in vitro to identify the surface on pol ii to which the minimal functional region of b rna binds we coupled multi step affinity purification reversible formaldehyde cross linking peptide sequencing by mass spectrometry and analysis of peptide enrichment the pol ii peptides most highly recovered after cross linking to b rna mapped to the dna binding cleft and active site region of pol ii these studies determine the location of a defined nucleic acid binding site on a large native multi subunit complex and provide insight into the mechanism of transcriptional repression by b rna
