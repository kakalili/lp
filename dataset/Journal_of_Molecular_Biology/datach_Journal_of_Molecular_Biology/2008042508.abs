mechanical unfoldons as building blocks of maltose binding protein
identifying independently folding cores or substructures is important for understanding and assaying the structure function and assembly of large proteins here we suggest mechanical stability as a criterion to identify building blocks of the   amino acid maltose binding protein mbp  we find that mbp when pulled at its termini unfolds via three meta  stable unfolding intermediates consequently the mbp structure consists of four structural blocks unfoldons that detach sequentially from the folded structure upon force application we used cysteine cross link mutations to characterize the four unfoldons structurally we showed that many mbp constructs composed of those building blocks indeed form stably folded structures in solution mechanical unfoldons may provide a new tool for a systematic search for stable substructures of large proteins
