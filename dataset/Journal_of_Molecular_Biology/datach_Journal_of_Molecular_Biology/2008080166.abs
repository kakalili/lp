a quantitative description of in vitro assembly of human papillomavirus  virus like particles
the full length human papillomavirus  major capsid protein l is expressed in saccharomyces cerevisiae as virus like particles vlps  however yeast expressed human papillomavirus  particles are irregular in shape and are prone to aggregate when disassembled and reassembled the resulting particles have improved stability and solubility we have examined vlp dissociation and reassembly to define the important features of the assembly mechanism we found that the vlps rapidly disassemble at ph   and low ionic strength in the presence of low concentrations of reducing agents the ph dependence of assembly kinetics and extent of assembly under reducing conditions were differentially sensitive to ionic strength assembly at ph   was very fast and led to heavily aggregated particles this sort of kinetic trap is expected for overinitiated assembly we observed that reassembly at ph      and   yielded regular particles over a broad range of ionic strength at these three ph values assembly was quantitative at  m nacl at ph    much more than at ph   or ph    assembly decreased monotonically with ionic strength the free energy of association ranged from   to    kcal mol per pentamer the effect of ph on assembly was further investigated by examining dissociation of reassembled particles though indistinguishable by negative stain electron microscopy particles assembled at ph   disassembled slower than ph      or   vlps we hypothesize that ph   assembly reactions lead to formation of particles with conformationally different interactions
