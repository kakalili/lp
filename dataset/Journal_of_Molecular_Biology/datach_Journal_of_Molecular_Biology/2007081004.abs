domain organization and polarity of tail needle gp  in the portal vertex structure of bacteriophage p
the attachment of tailed bacteriophages to the host cell wall as well as the penetration and injection of the viral genome into the host is mediated by the virion tail complex in phage p  a member of the podoviridae family that infects salmonella enterica the tail contains an      elongated protein needle previously identified as tail accessory factor gp  together with tail factors gp and gp  gp  is critical to close the portal protein channel and retain the viral dna inside the capsid by virtue of its topology and position in the virion the tail needle gp  is thought to function as a penetrating device to perforate the salmonella cell wall here we define the domain organization of gp  characterize the structural determinants for its stability and define the polarity of the gp  assembly into the phage portal vertex structure we have found that the n terminal  residues of gp  form a functional domain that although not required for gp  trimerization and overall stability is essential for the correct attachment to gp  which is thought to plug the portal vertex structure the region downstream of domain i domain ii folds into helical core which exhibits four trimerization octad repeats with consensus ile xx leu xxx val tyr we demonstrate that in vitro domain ii represents the main self assembling highly stable trimerization core of gp  which retains a folded conformation both in an anhydrous environment and in the presence of   sds the c terminus of gp  immediately downstream of domain ii contains a  sheet rich region domain iii and a short coiled coil domain iv which although not required for gp  trimerization enhance its thermodynamic stability we propose that domains iii and iv of the tail needle form the tip utilized by the phage to penetrate the host cell wall
