location and flexibility of the unique c terminal tail of aquifex aeolicus co chaperonin protein  as derived by cryo electron microscopy and biophysical techniques
co chaperonin protein   cpn  groes in escherichia coli is a ring shaped heptameric protein that facilitates substrate folding when in complex with cpn  groel in e coli  the cpn  from the hyperthermophilic ancient bacterium aquifex aeolicus aacpn  has a  residue c terminal extension in each monomer not found in any other cpn  protein earlier in vitro work has shown that this tail is not needed for heptamer assembly or protein function without the tail however the heptamers aacpn del   readily aggregate into fibrillar stacked rings to explain this phenomenon we performed binding experiments with a peptide construct of the tail to establish its specificity for aacpn del  and used cryo electron microscopy to determine the three dimensional  d structure of the groel  aacpn   adp complex at an   resolution we found that the groel  aacpn  structure is similar to the groel  groes structure at this resolution suggesting that aacpn  has molecular interactions with cpn  similar to other cpn s the cryo electron microscopy density map does not directly reveal the density of the aacpn   residue tail however the d statistical variance coefficient map computed from multiple d reconstructions with randomly selected particle images suggests that the tail is located at the aacpn  monomer  monomer interface and extends toward the cis ring apical domain of groel the tail at this location does not block the formation of a functional co chaperonin chaperonin complex but limits self aggregation into linear fibrils at high temperatures in addition the d variance coefficient map identifies several regions inside the groel  aacpn  complex that have flexible conformations this observation is in full agreement with the structural properties of an effective chaperonin
