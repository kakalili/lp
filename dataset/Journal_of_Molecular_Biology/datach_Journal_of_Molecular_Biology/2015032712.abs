adhesion of several cell lines to helicobacter pylori cagl is mediated by integrin  v  via an rgdlxxl motif
the helicobacter pylori type iv secretion system pilus protein cagl mediates interaction with host cells via its rgd motif here we analyzed prerequisites for this interaction within cagl and on host cells various human cell lines were tested for adhesion to cagl ht  and     cells adhered to immobilized recombinant cagl in an rgd dependent manner while  t human embryonic kidney and a  cells did not in a competitive elisa cagl competed with fibronectin for binding to the ectodomains of integrins  v  and  v  but not of  v    v    v  and     integrin  v  acts as receptor for several viruses exposing an rgdlxxl motif cagl also contains an rgdlxxl sequence we individually mutated leu  and leu  of this motif to threonine although both leucines are buried in the hydrophobic core surprisingly the ability of cagl variants l t and l t to support adhesion was significantly reduced for     cells and lost for mkn  and ht  cells the role of integrin  v  in adhesion to cagl was investigated using sw  cells transfected with the integrin   subunit sw     these cells adhered to cagl in an rgd dependent manner while mock transfected sw  cells did not the antibody g that blocks the function of integrin  v  inhibited adhesion of sw    mkn       and ht  cells to cagl in summary cagl features an rgdlxxl motif facilitating adhesion of several human cell lines via integrin  v   the buried location of leu  and leu  supports our previously published hypothesis that cagl partly unfolds upon integrin binding
