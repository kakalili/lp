solution structure of methylophilus methylotrophus cytochrome c   insights into the structural basis of haem ligand detachment edited by p e wright
cytochrome c  from methylophilus methylotrophus is a monohaem protein with   amino acid residues the iron has two histidine ligands in the oxidised form one of which detaches and picks up a proton when the protein is reduced thus both forms are paramagnetic the structure of the oxidised form in solution determined from nmr data is presented the family of structures has an average backbone rmsd value of     and a heavy atom rmsd value of     within a target function range of    this structure is related to class i cytochromes with an additional helix at the n terminus the haem binding site occurs in a domain essentially lacking secondary structure motifs and the axial histidinyl residues were found in an unusual near perpendicular orientation moreover a disulfide bridge is present an uncommon structural feature among c type cytochromes the disulfide bridge linking cysteine residues  and   forms a loop that confers rigidity and is essential to the detachment of the axial histidine his  as demonstrated by chemical disruption of the s s bond a route for protonation of the distal histidine involving haem propionate  is proposed and discussed in the light of available models for complex membrane proton pumps
