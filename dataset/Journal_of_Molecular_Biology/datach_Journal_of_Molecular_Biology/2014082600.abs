crystal structures of ricin toxin s enzymatic subunit rta in complex with neutralizing and non neutralizing single chain antibodies
ricin is a select agent toxin and a member of the rna n glycosidase family of medically important plant and bacterial ribosome inactivating proteins in this study we determined x ray crystal structures of the enzymatic subunit of ricin rta in complex with the antigen binding domains vhh of five unique single chain monoclonal antibodies that differ in their respective toxin neutralizing activities none of the vhhs made direct contact with residues involved in rta s rna n glycosidase activity or induced notable allosteric changes in the toxin s subunit rather the five vhhs had overlapping structural epitopes on the surface of the toxin and differed in the degree to which they made contact with prominent structural elements in two folding domains of the rta in general rta interactions were influenced most by the vhh cdr  cdr complementarity determining region elements with the most potent neutralizing antibody having the shortest and most conformationally constrained cdr  these structures provide unique insights into the mechanisms underlying toxin neutralization and provide critically important information required for the rational design of ricin toxin subunit vaccines
