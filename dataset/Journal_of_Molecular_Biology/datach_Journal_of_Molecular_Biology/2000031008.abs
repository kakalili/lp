e is an oncoprotein implicated in cervical cancers produced by  high risk  human papillomaviruses e is thought to promote tumorigenesis by stimulating cellular degradation of the tumour suppressor p  but it might display other activities sequence similarity was recently detected between e and endonuclease vii a protein of phage t that recognizes and cleaves four way dna junctions here we purified recombinant e proteins and demonstrated that high risk e s bind selectively to four way junctions in a structure dependent manner several residues in the c terminal zinc binding domain the region of e similar to endonuclease vii are necessary for the junction binding activity e binds to the junction as a monomer comparative electrophoresis shows that e bound junctions migrate in an extended square conformation magnesium inhibits the electrophoretic migration of the complexes but does not seem to influence their formation at equilibrium this work is the first demonstration of specific binding of purified active e to a well characterized dna ligand and suggests new modes of action of e in oncogenesis
