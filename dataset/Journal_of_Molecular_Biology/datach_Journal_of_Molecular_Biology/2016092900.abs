dna damage response rna binding proteins ddrbps  perspectives from a new class of proteins and their rna targets
upon dna damage cells trigger an early dna damage response ddr involving dna repair and cell cycle checkpoints and late responses involving gene expression regulation that determine cell fate screens for genes involved in the ddr have found many rna binding proteins rbps  while screens for novel rbps have identified ddr proteins an increasing number of rbps are involved in early and or late ddr we propose to call this new class of actors of the ddr which contain an rna binding activity dna damage response rna binding proteins ddrbps  we then discuss how ddrbps contribute not only to gene expression regulation in the late ddr but also to early ddr signaling dna repair and chromatin modifications at dna damage sites through interactions with both long and short noncoding rnas
