d polyglutamine amyloid recruits l polyglutamine monomers and kills cells
polyglutamine polyq amyloid fibrils are observed in disease tissue and have been implicated as toxic agents responsible for neurodegeneration in expanded cag repeat diseases such as huntington s disease despite intensive efforts the mechanism of amyloid toxicity remains unknown as a novel approach to probing polyq toxicity we investigate here how some cellular and physical properties of polyq amyloid vary with the chirality of the glutamine residues in the polyq we challenged pc  cells with small amyloid fibrils composed of either l or d polyq peptides and found that d fibrils are as cytotoxic as l fibrils we also found using fluorescence microscopy that both aggregates effectively seed the aggregation of cell produced l polyq proteins suggesting a surprising lack of stereochemical restriction in seeded elongation of polyq amyloid to investigate this effect further we studied chemically synthesized d and l polyq in vitro we found that as expected d polyq monomers are not recognized by proteins that recognize l polyq monomers however amyloid fibrils prepared from d polyq peptides can efficiently seed the aggregation of l polyq monomers in vitro and vice versa this result is consistent with our cell results on polyq recruitment but is inconsistent with previous literature reports on the chiral specificity of amyloid seeding this chiral cross seeding can be rationalized by a model for seeded elongation featuring a  rippled  sheet  interface between seed fibril and docked monomers of opposite chirality the lack of chiral discrimination in polyq amyloid cytotoxicity is consistent with several toxicity mechanisms including recruitment of cellular polyq proteins
