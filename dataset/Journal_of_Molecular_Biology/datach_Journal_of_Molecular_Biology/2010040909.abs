hbx induced hepatic steatosis and apoptosis are regulated by tnfr  and nf  b dependent pathways
hepatitis b virus x hbx protein is an important regulator of hepatic steatosis observed in patients with hepatitis b virus however its underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear tnf receptor  tnfr  is an essential pathway for the hbx mediated nuclear factor  b nf  b activation involved in hepatic liver injury here we show that hbx mediated steatosis and apoptosis are regulated by tnfr  and nf  b dependent pathways hbx mediated tumor necrosis factor   tnf   production and nf  b activation were completely diminished in anti tnf  treated cells and tnf      or tnfr     mice hbx and tnfr  which are potentiated by tnf   are physically associated and colocalize in the plasma membrane similarly tnfr depletion inhibits lipid droplets and lipogenic genes such as sterol regulatory element binding protein srebp  and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor ppar   increased in hbx tg mice and hepg gfphbx stable cells furthermore lipid accumulation and expression of srebp c and ppar  are significantly increased in adhbx gfp injected intravenous wild type mice but not in tnfr     mice hbx enhanced transcriptional activities of srebp and ppar  are significantly attenuated by the nf  b inhibitor bay     as well as by tnfr depletion also adhbx gfp potentiates tnf  induced apoptosis which is completely inhibited in tnfr depleted cells our results suggest that hbx induced nf  b activation was mediated by direct interaction with tnfr and thereby induced tnf  production hbx induced nf  b activation is also associated with the induction of hepatic steatosis and apoptosis which is determined by a tnfr dependent pathway
