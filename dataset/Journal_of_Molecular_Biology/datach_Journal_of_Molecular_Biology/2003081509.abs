the molecular basis of vitamin e retention structure of human  tocopherol transfer protein
tocopherol transfer protein   ttp is a liver protein responsible for the selective retention of  tocopherol from dietary vitamin e which is a mixture of       and  tocopherols and the corresponding tocotrienols the  ttp mediated transfer of  tocopherol into nascent vldl is the major determinant of plasma  tocopherol levels in humans mutations in the  ttp gene have been detected in patients suffering from low plasma  tocopherol and ataxia with isolated vitamin e deficiency aved the crystal structure of  ttp reveals two conformations in its closed tocopherol charged form a mobile helical surface segment seals the hydrophobic binding pocket in the presence of detergents an open conformation is observed which probably represents the membrane bound form the selectivity of  ttp for rrr  tocopherol is explained from the van der waals contacts occurring in the lipid binding pocket mapping the known mutations leading to aved onto the crystal structure shows that no mutations occur directly in the binding pocket
