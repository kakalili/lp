a structural perspective of the sequence variability within botulinum neurotoxin subtypes a a
botulinum neurotoxin bont is a category a toxin that has been classified within seven serotypes designated a  g recently it has been discovered that sequence variability occurs in bonts produced by serotype a bont a variant strains designated as subtypes a and a  which have significantly different antibody binding properties we have therefore made efforts to understand at the molecular level the diversity and its effects on the biological actions of the toxin including receptor binding substrate recognition and catalysis we provide the results of these studies including the analysis of two newly sequenced bont a variants loch maree a  and  ba a  and their comparison to a and a  using sequence analysis available functional data molecular modeling and comparison of models with the crystal structures of bont a and the light chain of bont a  we conclude that these sequence differences within subtypes will impact development of broad spectrum antibody and small ligand therapeutics and suggest dissimilarities in binding affinity and cleavage efficiency of the snap  substrate in particular sequence variation in subtypes bont a and bont a will likely effect  exosite and s   subsite recognition respectively
