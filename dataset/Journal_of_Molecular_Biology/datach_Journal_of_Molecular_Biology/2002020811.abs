tissue specific co expression and in vitro heteropolymer formation of the two small branchiostoma intermediate filament proteins a and b  edited by w baumeister
the two small intermediate filament if proteins a and b of the cephalochordate amphioxus were investigated blot overlays indicated a heterotypic interaction pattern of the recombinant proteins while the individual proteins formed only aggregates the stoichiometric mixture formed obligatory heteropolymeric filaments mutant proteins with a single cysteine residue in equivalent positions gave rise to filaments that oxidize to the disulfide linked heterodimer which can again form if thus the a b filaments which are expressed in the intestinal epithelium are based on a hetero coiled coil this keratin like assembly process of a plus b was unexpected since previous evolutionary tree calculations performed by two laboratories on the various amphioxus if proteins identified keratin i and ii orthologs but left the a b group as a separate branch we discuss obvious evolutionary aspects of the amphioxus if multigene family including the previously made observation that b  the closest relative of b  forms homopolymeric if in vitro and is like vertebrate type iii proteins expressed in mesodermally derived tissues
