cross talk between diverse serine integrases
phage encoded serine integrases are large serine recombinases that mediate integrative and excisive site specific recombination of temperate phage genomes they are well suited for use in heterologous systems and for synthetic genetic circuits as the attp and attb attachment sites are small  lt  bp  there are no host factor or dna supercoiling requirements and they are strongly directional doing only excisive recombination in the presence of a recombination directionality factor combining different recombinases that function independently and without cross talk to construct complex synthetic circuits is desirable and several different serine integrases are available however we show here that these functions are not reliably predictable and we describe a pair of serine integrases encoded by mycobacteriophages bxz and peaches with unusual and unpredictable specificities the integrases share only   amino acid sequence identity and the attp sites have fewer than   shared bases but they use the same attb site and there is non reciprocal cross talk between the two systems the dna binding specificities do not result from differences in specific dna contacts but from the constraints imposed by the configuration of the component half sites within each of the attachment site dnas
