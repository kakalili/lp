analysis of the open and closed conformations of the  subunits in thermophilic f atpase by solution nmr
f atpase composed of         and  subunits is a unique enzyme in terms of its rotational catalytic activity the smallest unit showing this function is the     complex we have investigated the       c   c truncated   complex from thermophilic bacillus ps  tf      kda in the solution state by using the combination of extensive deuteration segmental labeling and crinept cross correlated relaxation enhanced polarization transfer nmr well resolved crinept  hmqc heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation spectra of partially  n labeled tf   were obtained for this huge and asymmetric protein complex the spectrum of the c terminal domain of the  subunit revealed that the open form of the  subunit in the tf   complex is similar to that of the free  monomer the open  subunit in the tf   complex does not exhibit high affinity for nucleotides unlike the monomer but this is in agreement with the results of single molecule analysis of tf      on the other hand the closed form of the  subunit in the tf   complex was shown to be distinct from that of the nucleotide bound  monomer this is consistent with a previous report that the closed form of the tf  monomer could be a catalytically activated state the loop between the n terminal  barrel and the central domain is highly flexible in the tf   complex in contrast to that in the    hexamer suggesting that it is affected by the presence of the  subunit in this area
