phosphatidylglycerol lipids enhance folding of an  helical membrane protein
membrane lipids are increasingly being recognised as active participants in biological events the precise roles that individual lipids or global properties of the lipid bilayer play in the folding of membrane proteins remain to be elucidated here we find a significant effect of phosphatidylglycerol pg on the folding of a trimeric  helical membrane protein from escherichia coli diacylglycerol kinase both the rate and the yield of folding are increased by increasing the amount of pg in lipid vesicles moreover there is a direct correlation between the increase in yield and the increase in rate thus folding becomes more efficient in terms of speed and productivity this effect of pg seems to be a specific requirement for this lipid rather than a charge effect we also find an effect of single chain lyso lipids in decreasing the rate and yield of folding we compare this to our previous work in which lyso lipids increased the rate and yield of another membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin the contrasting effect of lyso lipids on the two proteins can be explained by the different folding reaction mechanisms and key folding steps involved our findings provide information on the lipid determinants of membrane protein folding
