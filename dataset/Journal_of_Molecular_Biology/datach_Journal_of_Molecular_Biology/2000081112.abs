deoxy d manno octulosonate  phosphate synthase from escherichia coli model of binding of phosphoenolpyruvate and d arabinose  phosphate edited by d rees
the crystal structure of  deoxy d manno octulosonate  phosphate synthase kdops from escherichia coli was determined by molecular replacement using coordinates given to us by radaev and co workers prior to publication the kdops crystals reported by radaev et al were grown in the presence of   m nh  so and   m k h po  they are in the cubic space group i  a      with a tetramer in the asymmetric unit the structure has been refined with data to     our crystals of e coli kdops grown in    w v polyethylene glycol peg    in the presence of the substrates  phosphoenolpyruvate pep and d arabinose  phosphate a p  are also in space group i  a      with one subunit in the asymmetric unit the medium of crystallization   m so po versus   peg does not significantly affect the conformation of kdops the inter monomer contacts in both structures are the same the     loop residues   to   situated near the entrance to the active site is not seen in the    structure but can be traced in the    structure most significantly radaev et al interpreted two so po sites in the    structure as marking the phosphate positions of the substrates pep and a p after the precedent of dahps in the    structure the inner of these two so po peaks is present at the same position as in the    structure of kdops the outer phosphate peak in the    kdops is    from the outer so po peak in the    structure and is within hydrogen bonding distance of arg  of the same subunit and arg  of another subunit based on the precedent of the d erythrose  phosphate e p modeled in the active site of dahps we have modeled pep and a p in kdops and compared the coordination of pep and a p in kdops with that of pep and e p in dahps
