structure of the aml eto nhr  pka rii  complex and its contribution to aml eto activity
aml eto is the chimeric protein product of t    in acute myeloid leukemia the eto portion of the fusion protein includes the nervy homology region nhr  domain which shares homology with a kinase anchoring proteins and interacts with the regulatory subunit of type ii camp dependent protein kinase a pka rii   we determined the solution structure of a complex between the aml eto nhr domain and pka rii   based on this structure a key residue in aml eto for pka rii  association was mutated this mutation did not disrupt aml eto s ability to enhance the clonogenic capacity of primary mouse bone marrow cells or its ability to repress proliferation or granulocyte differentiation introduction of the mutation into aml eto had minimal impact on in vivo leukemogenesis therefore the nhr  pka rii  protein interaction does not appear to significantly contribute to aml eto s ability to induce leukemia
