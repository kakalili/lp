dissecting the microscopic steps of the cyclophilin a enzymatic cycle on the biological hiv  capsid substrate by nmr
peptidyl  prolyl isomerases ppiases are emerging as key regulators of many diverse biological processes elucidating the role of ppiase activity in vivo has been challenging because mutagenesis of active site residues not only reduces the catalytic activity of these enzymes but also dramatically affects substrate binding employing the cyclophilin a ppiase together with its biologically relevant and natively folded substrate the n terminal domain of the human immunodeficiency virus type  capsid can protein we demonstrate here how to dissect residue specific contributions to ppiase catalysis versus substrate binding utilizing nmr spectroscopy surprisingly a number of cyclophilin a active site mutants previously assumed to be strongly diminished in activity toward biological substrates based only on a peptide assay catalyze the human immunodeficiency virus capsid with wild type activity but with a change in the rate limiting step of the enzymatic cycle the results illustrate that a quantitative analysis of catalysis using the biological substrates is critical when interpreting the effects of ppiase mutations in biological assays
