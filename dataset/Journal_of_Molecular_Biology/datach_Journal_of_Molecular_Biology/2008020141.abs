an unstable head  rod junction may promote folding into the compact off state conformation of regulated myosins
the n terminal region of myosin s rod like subfragment  s  joins the two heads of this dimeric molecule and is key to its function previously a crystal structure of this predominantly coiled coil region was determined for a short fragment   residues plus a leucine zipper of the scallop striated muscle myosin isoform in that study the n terminal     residues were found to be disordered we have now determined the structure of the same scallop peptide in three additional crystal environments in each of two of these structures improved order has allowed visualization of the entire n terminus in one chain of the dimeric peptide we have also compared the melting temperatures of this scallop s peptide with those of analogous peptides from three other isoforms taken together these experiments along with examination of sequences point to a diminished stability of the n terminal region of s in regulated myosins compared with those myosins whose regulation is thin filament linked it seems plain that this isoform specific instability promotes the off state conformation of the heads in regulated myosins we also discuss how myosin isoforms with varied thermal stabilities share the basic capacity to transmit force efficiently in order to produce contraction in their on states
