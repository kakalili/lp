the c c fragment of human cardiac myosin binding protein c has common binding determinants for both actin and myosin
the n terminal domains of cardiac myosin binding protein c mybp c play a regulatory role in modulating interactions between myosin and actin during heart muscle contraction using nmr spectroscopy and small angle neutron scattering we have determined specific details of the interaction between the two module human c c cmybp c fragment and f actin the small angle neutron scattering data show that c c spontaneously polymerizes monomeric actin g actin to form regular assemblies composed of filamentous actin f actin cores decorated by c c  similar to what was reported in our earlier four module mouse cmybp c actin study in addition nmr titration analyses show large intensity changes for a subset of c c peaks upon addition of g actin indicating that human c c interacts specifically with actin and promotes its assembly into filaments during the nmr titration peaks corresponding to cardiac specific c domain are the first to be affected followed by those from the c domain no peak intensity or position changes were detected for peaks arising from the disordered proline alanine rich p a linker connecting c with c  despite previous suggestions of its involvement in binding actin of considerable interest is the observation that the actin interaction  hot spots  within the c and c domains revealed in our nmr study overlap with regions previously identified as binding to the regulatory light chain of myosin and to myosin  s  our results suggest that c and c interact with myosin and actin using a common set of binding determinants and therefore support a cmybp c switching mechanism between myosin and actin
