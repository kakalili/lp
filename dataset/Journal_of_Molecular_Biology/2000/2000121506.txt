Insulator elements can be functionally identified by their ability to shield promoters from regulators in a position-dependent manner or their ability to protect adjacent transgenes from position effects. We have previously reported the identification of a 265bp sns DNA fragment at the 3â€² end of the sea urchin H2A early histone gene that blocked expression of a reporter gene in transgenic embryos when placed between the enhancer and the promoter. Here we show that sns interferes with enhancer-promoter interaction in a directional manner. When sns is placed between the H2A modulator and the inducible tet operator, the modulator is barred from interaction with the basal promoter. However, the tet activator (tTA) can still activate the promoter, even in the presence of sns, demonstrating that sns does not interfere with activity of a downstream enhancer. In addition, the H2A modulator can still drive expression of a divergently oriented transcription unit, suggesting that sns does not inhibit binding of transcription factor(s) to the enhancer. To identify cis-acting sequence elements within sns which are responsible for insulator activity, we have performed in vitro DNase I footprinting and EMSA analysis, and in vivo functional assays by microinjection into sea urchin embryos. We have identified three binding sites for protein complexes: a palindrome, a direct repeat, and a C+T sequence that corresponds to seven GAGA motifs on the transcribed strand. Insulator function requires all three cis-acting elements. Based on these results, we conclude that sns displays properties similar to the best characterized insulators and suggest that directional blocking of enhancer-activated transcription by sns depends on the assembly of distinct DNA-protein complexes.
