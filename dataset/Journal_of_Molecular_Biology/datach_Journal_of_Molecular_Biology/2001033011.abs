the complete nucleotide sequence of a plant root inducing ri plasmid indicates its chimeric structure and evolutionary relationship between tumor inducing ti and symbiotic sym plasmids in rhizobiaceae edited by n h chua
the ri root inducing plasmid in agrobacterium rhizogenes and ti tumor inducing plasmid in agrobacterium tumefaciens have provided the fundamental basis for the construction of plant vectors and transgenic plants recently the determination of the first complete nucleotide sequence of the ti plasmid pti sakura has been successful to understand the general structure of these oncogenic t dna transfer plasmids the whole nucleotide sequence of a mikimopine type ri plasmid pri   was analyzed the plasmid is     bp in size and has   open reading frames orfs in total which are asymmetrically distributed except for  orfs which are unknown   orfs were classified into  groups as follows three for dna replication nine for plasmid modification   for conjugation   for virulence   for t dna gene   for mikimopine mikimopine lactam transport ten for an unknown opine metabolism seven for transcriptional regulator five for sugar transport five for glycerol metabolism four for chemoreceptor and  for others the elucidated chimeric structure of pri   interestingly indicates that the evolution of rhizobiaceae plasmids seems to have kept interactions among the plasmids especially the genes and elements for a conjugal transfer of pri   had clearly closer kinship to those of a sym symbiotic plasmid pngr  a in rhizobium sp than those of ti plasmids by using sequencing and northern analysis we examined the metabolic pathway and gene expression of mikimopine which is probably an ri specific opine
