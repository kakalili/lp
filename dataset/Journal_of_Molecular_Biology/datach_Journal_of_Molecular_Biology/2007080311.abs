crystal structure of the stationary phase survival protein sure with metal ion and amp
the stationary phase survival protein sure is a metal ion dependent phosphatase distributed among eubacteria archaea and eukaryotes in escherichia coli sure has activities as nucleotidase and exopolyphosphatase and is thought to be involved in stress response however its physiological role and reaction mechanism are unclear we report here the crystal structures of the tetramer of sure from thermus thermophilus hb  ttsure both alone and crystallized with mn  and substrate amp in the presence of mn  and amp differences between the protomers were observed in the active site and in the loop located near the active site amp bound active sites with the loops in a novel open conformation were found in the two protomers and amp free active sites with the loops in a conventional closed conformation were found in the other two protomers the two loops in the open conformation are entwined with each other and this entwining is suggested to be required for enzymatic activity by site directed mutagenesis ttsure exists as an equilibrium mixture of dimer and tetramer in solution the loop entwined structure indicates that sure acts as a tetramer the structural features and the absence of negative cooperativity imply the half of the sites reactivity mechanism resulting from a pre existing tendency toward structural asymmetry
