connection of protein transport and organelle contact sites in mitochondria
mitochondrial biogenesis and function depend on the intensive exchange of molecules with other cellular compartments the mitochondrial outer membrane plays a central role in this communication process it is equipped with a number of specific protein machineries that enable the transport of proteins and metabolites furthermore the outer membrane forms molecular contact sites with other cell organelles like the endoplasmic reticulum er  thus integrating mitochondrial function in cellular physiology the best studied mitochondrial organelle contact site the er  mitochondria encounter structure ermes has been linked to many vital processes including mitochondrial division inheritance mitophagy and phospholipid transport strikingly er  mitochondria contact sites are closely connected to outer membrane protein translocases the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane tom represents the general mitochondrial entry gate for precursor proteins that are synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes the outer membrane also harbors the sorting and assembly machinery sam that mediates membrane insertion of  barrel proteins both of these essential protein translocases are functionally linked to er  mitochondria contact sites first the sam complex associates with an ermes core component to promote assembly of the tom complex second several tom components have been co opted as er  mitochondria tethers we propose that protein import and organelle contact sites are linked to coordinate processes important for mitochondrial biogenesis
