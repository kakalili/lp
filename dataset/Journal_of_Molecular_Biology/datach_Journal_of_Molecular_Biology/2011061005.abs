atp binding enables broad antibiotic selectivity of aminoglycoside phosphotransferase    iiia an elastic network analysis
the bacterial enzyme aminoglycoside phosphotransferase    iiia aph confers resistance against a wide range of aminoglycoside antibiotics in this study we use the gaussian network model to investigate how the binding of nucleotides and antibiotics influences the dynamics and thereby the ligand binding properties of aph interestingly in nmr experiments the dynamics differ significantly in various aph complexes although crystallographic studies indicate that no larger conformational changes occur upon ligand binding isothermal titration calorimetry also shows different thermodynamic contributions to ligand binding formation of aminoglycoside  aph complexes is enthalpically driven while the enthalpic change upon aminoglycoside binding to the nucleotide  aph complex is much smaller the differential effects of nucleotide binding and antibiotic binding to aph can be explained theoretically by single residue fluctuations and correlated motions of the enzyme the surprising destabilization of  sheet residues upon nucleotide binding as seen in hydrogen deuterium exchange experiments shows that the number of closest neighbors does not fully explain residue flexibility additionally we must consider correlated motions of dynamic protein domains which show that not only connectivity but also the overall protein architecture is important for protein dynamics
