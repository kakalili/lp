the occluding loop of cathepsin b prevents its effective inhibition by human kininogens
kininogens the major plasma cystatin like inhibitors of cysteine cathepsins are degraded at sites of inflammation and cathepsin b has been identified as a prominent mediator of this process cathepsin b in contrast to cathepsins l and s is poorly inhibited by kininogens this led us to delineate the molecular interactions between this protease and kininogens high molecular weight kininogen and low molecular weight kininogen and to elucidate the dual role of the occluding loop in this weak inhibition cathepsin b cleaves high molecular weight kininogen within the n terminal region of the d and d cystatin like domains and close to the consensus qvvag inhibitory pentapeptide of the d domain the his  ala mutant unlike his  ala cathepsin b fails to hydrolyze kininogens but rather forms a tight binding complex as observed by gel filtration analysis ki values picomolar range as well as association rate constants for the his  ala cathepsin b variant compare to those reported for cathepsin l for both kininogens homology modeling of isolated inhibitory d and d  domains and molecular dynamics simulations of the d domain complexed with wild type cathepsin b and its mutants indicate that additional weak interactions due to the lack of the salt bridge asp  his   and the subsequent open position of the occluding loop increase the inhibitory potential of kininogens on his  ala cathepsin b
