nmr structure of stem loop sl of the hiv   rna packaging signal reveals a novel a u a base triple platform edited by i tinoco
the genome of the human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  contains a stretch of    nucleotides known as the  site that is essential for rna packaging during virus assembly these nucleotides have been proposed to form four stem loops sl sl  that have both independent and overlapping functions stem loop sl is important for efficient recognition and packaging of the full length unspliced viral genome and also contains the major splice donor site sd for mrna splicing we have determined the structure of the  residue sl oligoribonucleotide by heteronuclear nmr methods the structure is generally consistent with the most recent of two earlier secondary structure predictions with residues g g c g and c u forming standard watson crick base pairs with self complementary residues c  g  c  c  and a  g  respectively however residue a  which is located near the center of the stem does not form a predicted bulge and residues a and u  do not form an expected watson crick base pair instead these residues form a novel a u  a  base triple that appears to be stabilized by hydrogen bonds from a  h  and h  to a n and u  o  respectively from a h  to u  o  and from c  h  to u  o   a kink in the backbone allows the aromatic rings of the sequential u  a  residues to be approximately co planar adopting a stable  platform motif  that is structurally similar to the a a adenosine platforms observed in the p p ribozyme domain of the tetrahymena group i intron platform motifs generally function in rna by mediating long range interactions and it is therefore possible that the a u a base triple platform mediates long range interactions that either stabilize the  rna or facilitate splicing and or packaging residue g of the g g u  g  tetraloop is stacked above the u a  base pair and the remaining tetraloop residues are disordered and available for potential interactions with either other rna or protein components
