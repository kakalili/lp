a new model for growth factor activation type ii receptors compete with the prodomain for bmp
bone morphogenetic proteins bmps are morphogens with long range signaling activities bmp  is secreted as a stable complex consisting of a growth factor noncovalently associated with two propeptides in other transforming growth factor  like growth factor complexes the prodomain pd confers latency to the complex however we detected no difference in signaling capabilities between the growth factor and the bmp  complex in multiple in vitro bioactivity assays biochemical and biophysical methods elucidated the interaction between the bmp  complex and the extracellular domains of its type i and type ii receptors results showed that type ii receptors such as bmp receptor ii activin receptor iia and activin receptor iib competed with the pd for binding to the growth factor and displaced the pd from the complex in contrast type i receptors interacted with the complex without displacing the pd these studies suggest a new model for growth factor activation in which proteases or other extracellular molecules are not required and provide a molecular mechanism consistent with a role for bmp receptors in the establishment of early morphogen gradients
