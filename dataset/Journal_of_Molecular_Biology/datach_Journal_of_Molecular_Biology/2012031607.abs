structure of the ultra high affinity colicin e dnase  im complex
how proteins achieve high affinity binding to a specific protein partner while simultaneously excluding all others is a major biological problem that has important implications for protein design we report the crystal structure of the ultra high affinity protein  protein complex between the endonuclease domain of colicin e and its cognate immunity im protein im  kd      m  which by comparison to previous structural and biophysical data provides unprecedented insight into how high affinity and selectivity are achieved in this model family of protein complexes our study pinpoints the role of structured water molecules in conjoining hotspot residues that govern stability with residues that control selectivity a key finding is that a single residue which in a noncognate context massively destabilizes the complex through frustration does not participate in specificity directly but rather acts as an organizing center for a multitude of specificity interactions across the interface many of which are water mediated
