engineered i crei derivatives cleaving sequences from the human xpc gene can induce highly efficient gene correction in mammalian cells
meganucleases are sequence specific endonucleases which recognize large  gt   bp target sites in living cells and can stimulate homologous gene targeting by a   fold factor at the cleaved locus we have recently described a combinatorial approach to redesign the i crei meganuclease dna binding interface in order to target chosen sequences however engineering was limited to the protein regions shown to directly interact with dna in a base specific manner here we take advantage of i crei natural degeneracy and of additional refinement steps to extend the number of sequences that can be efficiently cleaved we searched the sequence of the human xpc gene involved in the disease xeroderma pigmentosum xp  for potential targets and chose three sequences that differed from the i crei cleavage site over their entire length including the central four base pairs whose role in the dna protein recognition and cleavage steps remains very elusive two out of these targets could be cleaved by engineered i crei derivatives and we could improve the activity of weak novel meganucleases to eventually match the activity of the parental i crei scaffold the novel proteins maintain a narrow cleavage pattern for cognate targets showing that the extensive redesign of the i crei protein was not made at the expense of its specificity finally we used a chromosomal reporter system in cho k cells to compare the gene targeting frequencies induced by natural and engineered meganucleases tailored i crei derivatives cleaving sequences from the xpc gene were found to induce high levels of gene targeting similar to the i crei scaffold or the i scei  gold standard   this is the first time an engineered homing endonuclease has been used to modify a chromosomal locus
