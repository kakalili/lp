specificity and affinity of lac repressor for the auxiliary operators o and o are explained by the structures of their protein  dna complexes
the structures of a dimeric mutant of the lac repressor dna binding domain complexed with the auxiliary operators o and o have been determined using nmr spectroscopy and compared to the structures of the previously determined lac  o and lac  nonoperator complexes structural analysis of the lac  o and lac  o complexes shows highly similar structures with very similar numbers of specific and nonspecific contacts in agreement with similar affinities for these two operators the left monomer of the lac repressor in the lac  o complex retains most of these specific contacts however in the right half site of the o operator there is a significant loss of protein  dna contacts explaining the low affinity of the lac repressor for the o operator the binding mode in the right half site resembles that of the nonspecific complex in contrast to the lac  nonoperator dna complex where no hinge helices are formed the stability of the hinge helices in the weak lac  o complex is the same as in the lac  o and lac  o complexes as judged from the results of hydrogen deuterium experiments
