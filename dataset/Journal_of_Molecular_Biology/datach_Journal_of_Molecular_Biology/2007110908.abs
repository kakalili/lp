crystal structure of streptococcus dysgalactiae derived mitogen reveals a zinc binding site and alterations in tcr binding
bacterial superantigens are protein toxins with an ability to cause serious diseases in humans by activating a large number of t cells streptococcus dysgalactiae derived mitogen sdm is a novel superantigen that is distinct from other known superantigens based on phylogenetic analysis the x ray structure of sdm has been determined at     resolution sdm shares the same characteristic fold with other superantigens but it shows a major structural difference due to the lack of the   helix between the   and   strands a bound zinc ion was identified in the structure at the c terminal domain of the molecule sdm appears to bind to the major histocompatibility complex class ii  chain through the zinc binding site as described by mutagenesis data and structural comparisons t cell binding instead shows a significant difference compared to other superantigens the mutation of asn  a conserved residue that is known to be significant for t cell receptor binding in other superantigens and lys  to ala did not cause any decrease in the mitogenic activity of sdm this observation and the lack of the   helix suggest alterations in t cell receptor binding
