full length recombinant plasmodium falciparum var csa binds specifically to cspg and induces potent parasite adhesion blocking antibodies
plasmodium falciparum malaria remains one of the world s leading causes of human suffering and poverty each year the disease takes    million lives mainly in sub saharan africa the adhesion of infected erythrocytes ies to vascular endothelium or placenta is the key event in the pathogenesis of severe p falciparum infection in pregnant women the parasites express a single and unique member of the p falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein  pfemp  family named var csa which is associated with the ability of the ies to adhere specifically to chondroitin sulphate a csa in the placenta several duffy binding like domains from var csa molecules have been shown in vitro to bind to csa but it has also been demonstrated that duffy binding like domains from pfemp proteins other than var csa can bind csa in addition the specificity of the binding of var csa domains to glycosaminoglycans does not match that of var csa expressing ies this has led to speculation that the domains of native var csa need to come together to form a specific binding site or that var csa might bind to csa through a bridging molecule here we describe the expression and purification of the complete extracellular region of var csa secreted at high yields from insect cells using surface plasmon resonance we demonstrate that var csa alone binds with nanomolar affinity to human chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan and with significantly weaker affinity to other glycosaminoglycans showing a specificity similar to that observed for ies antibodies raised against full length var csa completely inhibit recombinant var csa binding as well as parasite binding to chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan this is the first study to describe the successful production and functionality of a full length pfemp  the specificity of the binding and anti adhesion potency of induced igg together with high yield production encourages the use of full length pfemp in vaccine development strategies
