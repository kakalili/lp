crystal structure and standardized geometric analysis of inlj a listerial virulence factor and leucine rich repeat protein with a novel cysteine ladder
we report on the crystal structure of the internalin domain of inlj a virulence associated surface protein of listeria monocytogenes at    resolution inlj is a member of the internalin family of listerial cell surface proteins characterized by a common n terminal domain inlj bears  leucine rich repeats lrrs  the same number as in inla the prototypical internalin family member the lrrs of inlj differ from those of other internalins by having   rather than   residues and by replacing  lrr defining hydrophobic residue with a conserved cysteine these cysteines stack to form an intramolecular ladder and regular hydrophobic interactions in consecutive repeats analyzing the curvature twist and lateral bending angles of inlj and comparing these with several other lrr proteins we provide a systematic geometric comparison of lrr protein structures http  bragi helmholtz hzi de angulator  these indicate that both cysteine and asparagine ladders stabilize the lrr fold whereas substitutions in some repeat positions are more likely than others to induce changes in lrr geometry
