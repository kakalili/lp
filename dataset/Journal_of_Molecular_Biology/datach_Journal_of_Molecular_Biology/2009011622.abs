crystal structure of the pml p subunit of the yeast precursor mrna retention and splicing complex
the precursor mrna retention and splicing res complex mediates nuclear retention and enhances splicing of precursor mrnas the res complex from yeast comprises three proteins snu p bud p and pml p snu p acts as a central platform that concomitantly binds the bud p and pml p subunits via short peptide epitopes as a step to decipher the molecular architecture of the res complex we have determined crystal structures of full length pml p and n terminally truncated pml p the first  residues of full length pml p encompassing the snu p binding region are disordered showing that pml p binds to snu p via an intrinsically unstructured region the remainder of pml p folds as a forkhead associated fha domain which is expanded by a number of noncanonical elements compared with known fha domains from other proteins an atypical n terminal appendix runs across one  sheet and thereby stabilizes the domain as shown by deletion experiments fha domains are thought to constitute phosphopeptide binding elements consistently a sulfate ion was found at the putative phosphopeptide binding loops of full length pml p the n terminally truncated version of the protein lacked a similar phosphopeptide mimic but retained an almost identical structure a long loop neighboring the putative phosphopeptide binding site was disordered in both structures comparison with other fha domain proteins suggests that this loop adopts a defined conformation upon ligand binding and thereby confers ligand specificity our results show that in the res complex an fha domain of pml p is flexibly tethered via an unstructured n terminal region to snu p
