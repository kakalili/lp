a self scaffolding model for g protein signaling
activation of heterotrimeric g proteins is generally believed to induce dissociation of g  and g   subunits which are then free to bind to and change the catalytic activity of a variety of intracellular enzymes we have previously found that in cells g q subunits remain complexed with its major effector phospholipase c   through the activation cycle to determine whether this behavior may be operative in other systems we carried out f rster resonance energy transfer studies and found that eyfp g i and ecfp g   remain associated after stimulation in hek  cells we also found that the level of forster resonance energy transfer between alexa  phospholipase c  and egfp g   is significant and unchanged upon activation in hek  cells thus showing that these proteins can localize into stable signaling complexes to understand the basis for this stabilization we carried out in vitro studies using a series of single cys mutants labeled with fluorescence tags and monitored their interaction with g   subunits and changes in their fluorescence properties and accessibility upon activation and g   binding our studies suggest a significant change in the orientation between g protein subunits upon activation that allows the g proteins to remain complexed while activating effectors
