methionine sulfoxide reductase b displays a high level of flexibility
methionine sulfoxide reductases msrs are enzymes that catalyze the reduction of methionine sulfoxide back to methionine in vivo msrs are essential in the protection of cells against oxidative damage to proteins and in the virulence of some bacteria two structurally unrelated classes of msrs named msra and msrb exist msrb are stereospecific to r epimer on the sulfur of sulfoxide all msrb share a common reductase step with the formation of a sulfenic acid intermediate for the subclass of msrb whose recycling process passes through the formation of an intradisulfide bond the recycling reducer is thioredoxin in the present study x ray structures of neisseria meningitidis msrb have been determined the structures have a fold based on two  sheets similar to the fold already described for other msrb with the recycling cys  located in a position favorable for disulfide bond formation with the catalytic cys   x ray structures of xanthomonas campestris msrb have also been determined in the c  s msrb structure with a bound substrate the recycling cys  is far from ser   with trp  being essential in the reductase step located in between this positioning prevents the formation of the cys  cys  disulfide bond in the oxidized structure a drastic conformational reorganization of the two  sheets due to withdrawal of the trp  region from the active site which remains compatible with an efficient thioredoxin recycling process is observed the results highlight the remarkable structural malleability of the msrb fold
