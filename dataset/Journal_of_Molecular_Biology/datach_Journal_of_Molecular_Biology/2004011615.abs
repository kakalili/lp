complex structures of thermoactinomyces vulgaris r    amylase  with malto oligosaccharides demonstrate the role of domain n acting as a starch binding domain
the x ray structures of complexes of thermoactinomyces vulgaris r    amylase  tvai with an inhibitor acarbose and an inactive mutant tvai with malto hexaose and malto tridecaose have been determined at     and    resolution and the structures have been refined to r factors of    rfree            and        respectively with good chemical geometries acarbose binds to the catalytic site of tvai and interactions between acarbose and the enzyme are very similar to those found in other structure solved  amylase acarbose complexes supporting the proposed catalytic mechanism based on the structure of the tvai acarbose complex the binding mode of pullulan containing     glucoside linkages could be deduced due to the structural difference caused by the replaced amino acid residue gln  for glu in the catalytic site malto hexaose and malto tridecaose partially bind to the catalytic site giving a mimic of the enzyme product complex besides the catalytic site four sugar binding sites on the molecular surface are found in these x ray structures two sugar binding sites in domain n hold the oligosaccharides with a regular helical structure of amylose which suggests that the domain n is a starch binding domain acting as an anchor to starch in the catalytic reaction of the enzyme an assay of hydrolyzing activity for the raw starches confirmed that tvai can efficiently hydrolyze raw starch
