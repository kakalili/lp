the monomer  seed interaction mechanism in the formation of the   microglobulin amyloid fibril clarified by solution nmr techniques
amyloid fibrils are proteinous aggregates associated with various diseases including alzheimer s disease type ii diabetes and dialysis related amyloidosis it is generally thought that during the progression of these diseases a precursor peptide or protein assumes a partially denatured structure which interacts with the fibril seed to change into the final amyloid form   microglobulin   m  associated with dialysis related amyloidosis is known to form amyloid fibrils at low ph via a partially structured state however the molecular mechanism by which the conformation of  m changes from the precursor to the final fibril structure is poorly understood we performed various nmr experiments to characterize acid denatured  m the analysis of the transverse relaxation rates revealed that acid denatured  m undergoes a structural exchange with an extensively unfolded form the results of transferred cross saturation experiments indicated that residues with a residual structure in the acid denatured state are associated with the interaction with the fibril seed our experimental data suggest the partially structured state to be  activated  to become extensively unfolded in which state the hydrophobic residues are exposed and associate with the seed our results provide general information about the extension of amyloid fibrils
