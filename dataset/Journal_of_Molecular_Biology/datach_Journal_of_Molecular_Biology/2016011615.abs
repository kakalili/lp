structure of a tcr mimic antibody with target predicts pharmacogenetics
antibody therapies currently target only extracellular antigens a strategy to recognize intracellular antigens is to target peptides presented by immune hla receptors esk is a human t cell receptor tcr mimic antibody that binds with subnanomolar affinity to the rmf peptide from the intracellular wilms tumor oncoprotein wt in complex with hla a    esk is therapeutically effective in mouse models of wt  human cancers tcr based therapies have been presumed to be restricted to one hla subtype the mechanism for the specificity and high affinity of esk is unknown we show in a crystal structure that esk fab binds to rmf hla a    in a mode different from that of tcrs from the structure we predict and then experimentally confirm high affinity binding with multiple other hla a  subtypes broadening the potential patient pool for esk therapy using the crystal structure we also predict potential off target binding that we experimentally confirm our results demonstrate how protein structure information can contribute to personalized immunotherapy
