a tract bending insights into experimental structures by computational models edited by dr i tinoco
while solution structures of adenine tract a tract oligomers have indicated a unique bend direction equivalent to negative global roll commonly termed  minor groove bending   crystallographic data have not unambiguously characterized the bend direction nevertheless many features are shared by all a tract crystal and solution structures e g propeller twisting narrow minor grooves and localized water spines  to examine the origin of bending and to relate findings to the crystallographic and solution data we analyze molecular dynamics trajectories of two solvated a tract dodecamers  d  d cgcga cg  and d  d cgca gcg  using a new general global bending framework for analyzing bent dna and dna protein complexes it is significant that the crystallographically based initial structures are converted from dissimilar to similar bend directions equivalent to negative global roll with the average helical axis bend ranging from     to     the largest bend occurs as positive roll of    on the   side of the a tracts supporting a junction model and is reinforced by gradual curvature at each a tract base pair bp step supporting a wedge model  the precise magnitude of the bend is subtly sequence dependent consistent with a curved general sequence model  the conversion to negative global roll only requires small local changes at each bp accumulated over flexible moieties both outside and inside the a tract in contrast the control sequence bna d cgcga ttcgcg  bends marginally only     with no preferred direction the molecular features that stabilize the bend direction in the a tract dodecamers include propeller twisting of at base pairs puckering differences between a and t deoxyriboses a narrow minor groove and a stable water spine that extends slightly beyond the a tract with lifetimes approaching   ns  the sugar conformations in particular are proposed as important factors that support bent dna it is significant that all these curvature stabilizing features are also observed in the crystallographic structures but yield overall different bending paths largely due to the effects of sequences outside the a tract these results merge structural details reported for a tract structures by experiment and theory and lead to structural and dynamic insights into sequence dependent dna flexibility as highlighted by the effect of an a tract variant of a tata box element on bending and flexibility required for tbp binding
