the coordination of the isomerization of a conserved non prolyl cis peptide bond with the rate limiting steps in the folding of dihydrofolate reductase
the propensity for peptide bonds to adopt the trans configuration in native and unfolded proteins and the relatively slow rates of cis  trans isomerization reactions imply that the formation of cis peptide bonds in native conformations are likely to limit folding reactions the role of the conserved cis gly   gly  peptide bond in dihydrofolate reductase dhfr from escherichia coli was examined by replacing gly  with alanine the introduction of a beta carbon at position  is expected to increase the propensity for the trans isomer and perturb the isomerization reaction required to reach the native conformation although g a dhfr is   kcalmol   less stable than the wild type protein it adopts a well folded structure that can be chemically denatured in a cooperative fashion the mutant protein also retains the complex refolding kinetic pattern attributed to a parallel channel mechanism in wild type dhfr the spectroscopic response upon refolding monitored by trp fluorescence and the absence of a trp trp exciton coupling apparent in the far uv cd spectrum of the wild type protein however indicated that the tertiary structure of the folded state for g a dhfr is altered the addition of methotrexate mtx  a tight binding inhibitor to folded g a dhfr restored the exciton coupling and the fluorescence properties through five slow kinetic events whose relaxation times are independent of the ligand and the denaturant concentrations the results were interpreted to mean that mtx binding drives the formation of the cis isomer of the peptide bond between ala  and gly  in five compact and stable but not wild type like conformations that contain the trans isomer folding studies in the presence of mtx for both wild type and g a dhfr support the notion that the cis peptide bond between gly  and gly  in the wild type protein forms during four parallel rate limiting steps which are primarily controlled by folding reactions and lead directly to a set of native or native like conformers the isomerization of the cis peptide bond is not a source of the parallel channels that characterize the complex folding mechanism for dhfr
