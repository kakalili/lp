helix viii of nhaa na h antiporter participates in the periplasmic cation passage and ph regulation of the antiporter
the crystal structure of escherichia coli nhaa determined at ph  has provided insights into the mechanism of activity of a ph regulated na h antiporter however because nhaa is active at physiological ph ph       many questions related to the active state of nhaa have remained unanswered our cys scanning of the highly conserved transmembrane viii at physiological ph reveals that   the cys replacement g  c significantly increases the apparent km of the antiporter to both na   fold and li   fold    variants g  c and g  c cause a drastic alkaline shift of the ph profile of nhaa by  ph unit   residues gly  ala  line a periplasmic funnel at physiological ph as they do at ph   both were modified by membrane impermeant negatively charged  sulfonatoethyl methanethiosulfonate and positively charged  trimethyl ammonium ethylmethanethiosulfonate sulfhydryl reagents that could reach cys replacements from the periplasm via water filled funnels only whereas other cys replacements on helix viii were not accessible reactive to the reagents   remarkably the modification of variant v  c by  sulfonatoethyl methanethiosulfonate or  trimethyl ammonium ethylmethanethiosulfonate totally inhibited antiporter activity while n ethyl maleimide modification had a very small effect on nhaa activity hence the size  rather than the chemical modification or the charge  of the larger reagents interferes with the passage of ions through the periplasmic funnel taken together our results at physiological ph reveal that amino acid residues in transmembrane viii contribute to the cation passage of nhaa and its ph regulation
