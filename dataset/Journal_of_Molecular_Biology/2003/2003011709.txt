Three different medium-resolution structures of the human water channel aquaporin-1 (AQP1) have been solved by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) during the last two years. Recently, the structure of the strongly related bovine AQP1 was solved by X-ray crystallography at higher resolution, allowing a validation of the original medium-resolution structures, and providing a good indication for the strengths and limitations of state of the art cryo-EM methods. We present a detailed comparison between the different models, which shows that overall, the structures are highly similar, deviating less than 2.5Å from each other in the helical backbone regions. The two original cryo-EM structures, however, also show a number of significant deviations from the X-ray structure, both in the backbone positions of the transmembrane helices and in the location of the amino acid side-chains facing the pore. In contrast, the third cryo-EM structure that included information from the X-ray structure of the homologous bacterial glycerol facilitator GlpF and that was subsequently refined against cryo-EM AQP1 data, shows a root mean square deviation of 0.9Å from the X-ray structure in the helical backbone regions.
