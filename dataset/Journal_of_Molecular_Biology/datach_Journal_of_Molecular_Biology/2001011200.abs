nmr spectroscopic evidence for mn  mg  binding to a precursor trna microhelix near the potential rnase p cleavage site
the binding of mg  mn  to acceptor stem microhelices as minimal models for precursor trnagly is demonstrated by nmr spectroscopy from the evaluation of cosy and noesy spectra binding sites for mg  mn  can be inferred in particular one binding site exists near the ribose moiety of nucleotide   at the position of cleavage by rnase p from comparison with a variant possessing a deoxynucleotide at this position it is concluded that the   oh group of this nucleotide is indispensable for coordinating the divalent metal ion hence this catalytically important metal ion is  pre bound  to the precursor trna before complexation with rnase p
