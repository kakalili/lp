a low barrier hydrogen bond between histidine of secreted phospholipase a and a transition state analog inhibitor
this work describes in depth nmr characterization of a unique low barrier hydrogen bond lbhb between an active site residue from the enzyme and a bound inhibitor the complex between secreted phospholipase a  spla  from bee venom and bovine pancreas and a transition state analog inhibitor hk  a downfield proton nmr resonance at     ppm was observed in the complex but not in the free enzyme on the basis of site specific mutagenesis and specific  n decoupling this downfield resonance was assigned to the active site h  which is part of the catalytic dyad d  h  these results led to a hypothesis that the downfield resonance represents the proton h  of h  involved in the h bonding between d  and h  in analogy with serine proteases however this was shown not to be the case by use of the bovine enzyme labeled with specific  n  his instead the downfield resonance arises from h  of h  which forms a hydrogen bond with a non bridging phosphonate oxygen of the inhibitor further studies showed that this proton displays a fractionation factor of        and an exchange rate protection factor of gt   at   k and gt  at   k which are characteristic of a lbhb the pka of the imidazole ring of h  was shown to be shifted from   for the free enzyme to an apparent value of   in the presence of the inhibitor these properties are very similar to those of the asp  his lbhbs in serine proteases possible structural bases and functional consequences for the different locations of the lbhb between these two types of enzymes are discussed the results also underscore the importance of using specific isotope labeling rather than extrapolation of nmr results from other enzyme systems to assign the downfield proton resonance to a specific hydrogen bond although our studies did not permit the strength of the lbhb to be accurately measured the data do not provide support for an unusually strong hydrogen bond strength i e  gt  kcal mol
