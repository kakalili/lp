solution structure of the ubp m buz domain a highly specific protein module that recognizes the c terminal tail of free ubiquitin
the buz znf ubp domain is a distinct ubiquitin binding module found in the cytoplasmic deacetylase hdac  the e ubiquitin ligase brap imp and a subfamily of deubiquitinating enzymes here we report the solution structure of the buz domain of ubp m a ubiquitin specific protease and its interaction with ubiquitin unlike the buz domain from isopeptidase t isot that contains a single zinc finger the ubp m buz domain features three zinc binding sites consisting of  residues these zinc ligands form a pair of cross braced ring fingers encapsulated within a third zinc finger in the primary structure in contrast to isot which can form an n terminal loop swapped dimer in the crystal state the formation of additional zinc fingers in the ubp m buz domain restricts its n terminal loop to intra domain interactions the ubiquitin binding site of the ubp m buz domain is mapped to the highly conserved concave surface formed by the   helix and the central  sheet we further show that this site binds to the c terminal tail of free ubiquitin and corresponding peptides display essentially the same binding affinities as full length ubiquitin does for the ubp m buz domain however modification of the g ub carboxylate group either by a peptide or isopeptide bond abolishes buz  domain interaction the unique ubiquitin recognition mode of the buz domain family suggests that they may function as  sensors  of free ubiquitin in cells to achieve regulatory roles in many aspects of ubiquitin dependent processes
