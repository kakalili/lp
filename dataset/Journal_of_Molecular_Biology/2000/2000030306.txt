Single-stranded DNA-binding proteins have in common their crucial roles in DNA metabolism, although they exhibit significant differences in their single-stranded DNA binding properties. To evaluate the correlation between the structure of different nucleoprotein complexes and their function, we have carried out a comparative study of the complexes that the single-stranded DNA-binding proteins of three related bacteriophages, ø29, Nf and GA-1, form with single-stranded DNA. Under the experimental conditions used, ø29 and Nf single-stranded DNA-binding proteins are stable monomers in solution, while GA-1 single-stranded DNA-binding protein presents a hexameric state, as determined in glycerol gradients. The thermodynamic parameters derived from quenching measurements of the intrinsic protein fluorescence upon single-stranded DNA binding revealed (i) that GA-1 single-stranded DNA-binding protein occludes a larger binding site (n=51 nt/oligomer) than ø29 and Nf SSBs (n=3.4 and 4.7 nt/monomer, respectively); and (ii) that it shows a higher global affinity for single-stranded DNA (GA-1 SSB, Keff=18.6 × 105 M−1; ø29 SSB, Keff=2.2 × 105 M−1; Nf SSB, Keff=2.9 × 105 M−1). Altogether, these parameters justify the differences displayed by the GA-1 single-stranded DNA-binding protein and single-stranded DNA complex under the electron microscope, and the requirement of higher amounts of ø29 and Nf single-stranded DNA-binding proteins than of GA-1 SSB in gel mobility shift assays to produce a similar effect. The structural differences of the nucleoprotein complexes formed by the three single-stranded DNA-binding proteins with single-stranded DNA correlate with their different functional stimulatory effects in ø29 DNA amplification.
