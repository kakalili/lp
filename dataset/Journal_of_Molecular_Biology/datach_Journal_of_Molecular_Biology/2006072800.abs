the unfolded state of the villin headpiece helical subdomain computational studies of the role of locally stabilized structure
the  residue villin headpiece helical subdomain hp  is one of the fastest cooperatively folding proteins folding on the microsecond timescale hp   s simple three helix topology fast folding and small size have made it an attractive model system for computational and experimental studies of protein folding recent experimental studies have explored the denatured state of hp  using fragment analysis coupled with relatively low resolution spectroscopic techniques these studies have shown that there is apparently only a small tendency to form locally stabilized secondary structure here we complement the experimental studies by using replica exchange molecular dynamics with explicit solvent to investigate the structural features of these peptide models of unfolded hp  to ensure convergence two sets of simulations for each fragment were performed with different initial structures and simulations were continued until these generated very similar final ensembles these simulations reveal low populations of native like structure and early folding events that cannot be resolved by experiment for each fragment calculated j coupling constants and helical propensities are in good agreement with experimental trends hp  corresponding to residues  to  and including the first  helix contains the highest helical population hp  corresponding to residues  through  and including the third  helix contains a small population of helical turn residing at the n terminus while hp  corresponding to residues  through  and including the second  helix formed little to no structure in isolation overall hp  was the only fragment to adopt a native like conformation but the low population suggests that formation of significant structure only occurs after formation of specific tertiary interactions
