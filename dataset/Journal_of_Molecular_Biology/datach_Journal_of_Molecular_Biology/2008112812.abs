solution structure and characterization of the dna binding activity of the b bp  smr domain
the muts protein recognizes unpaired bases and initiates mismatch repair which are essential for high fidelity dna replication the homologous muts protein does not contribute to mismatch repair but suppresses homologous recombination muts lacks the damage recognition domain of muts  but contains an additional c terminal extension the small muts related smr domain this domain which is present in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes has previously been reported to bind to dna and to possess nicking endonuclease activity we determine here the solution structure of the functionally active smr domain of the bcl binding protein also known as nedd binding protein   a protein with unknown function that lacks other domains present in muts proteins the smr domain adopts a two layer     sandwich fold which has a structural similarity to the c terminal domain of if  the r h domain and the n terminal domain of dnase i the most conserved residues are located in three loops that form a contiguous exposed and positively charged surface with distinct sequence identity for prokaryotic and eukaryotic smr domains nmr titration experiments and dna binding studies using bcl binding protein  smr domain mutants suggested that these most conserved loop regions participate in dna binding to single stranded double stranded dna junctions based on the observed dna binding induced multimerization the structural similarity with both subdomains of dnase i and the experimentally identified dna binding surface we propose a model for dna recognition by the smr domain
