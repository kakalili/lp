kinetic instability of the serpin z   antitrypsin promotes aggregation
the serpinopathies encompass a large number of diseases caused by inappropriate conformational change and self association polymerization of a serpin serine proteinase inhibitor molecule the most common serpinopathy is   antitrypsin   at deficiency which is associated with an increased risk for liver cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma and early onset emphysema the z variant of  at which accounts for   of all cases of  at deficiency polymerizes during synthesis and after secretion here we show using intrinsic and extrinsic fluorescence probes that z  at exists in a non native conformation we examined the thermodynamic stability by transverse urea gradient gel electrophoresis thermal denaturation and equilibrium guanidine hydrochloride unfolding and found that despite structural differences between the two proteins wild type  at and z  at display similar unfolding pathways and thermodynamic stabilities far uv circular dichroism and bis ans     dianilino    binaphthyl    disulfonic acid dipotassium salt fluorescence suggest that the intermediate ensembles formed during unfolding of wild type  at and z  at are characterized by similar structural features kinetic analysis of the unfolding transition showed that z  at unfolds at least   fold faster than the wild type the biological implications of these data are discussed
