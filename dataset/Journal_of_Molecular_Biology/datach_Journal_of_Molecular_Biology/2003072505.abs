optimization and generality of a small deoxyribozyme that ligates rna
in vitro evolution was previously used to identify a small deoxyribozyme  q  that ligates rna with formation of a       phosphodiester linkage from a      cyclic phosphate and a   hydroxyl group ligation occurs in a convenient  binding arms  format analogous to that of the well known     and    rna cleaving deoxyribozymes here we report the optimization and generality of q  as a       rna ligase by comprehensive mutagenesis of its  nucleotide enzyme region the parent q  sequence is shown to be optimal for rna ligation yield although several mutations are capable of increasing the ligation rate approximately fivefold at the expense of yield the q  deoxyribozyme ligates any rna substrates that form the sequence motif ua  gr arrowhead ligation site and r purine  providing at least   yield of ligated rna in     hours at   c and ph   comparable yields are obtained in      hours at ph   which may be more suitable for larger rnas that are more sensitive to non specific degradation for rna substrates that form the related ligation junction ua  gy y pyrimidine  somewhat lower yields are obtained but significant ligation activity is still observed these data establish that q  is a generally applicable rna ligase a plot of log kobs versus ph from ph   to   has a slope of just under  suggesting that a single deprotonation occurs during the rate determining reaction step the compact q  deoxyribozyme has both practical utility and the potential for increasing our structural and mechanistic understanding of how nucleic acids can mediate chemical reactions
