refined structure of desmodium yellow mottle tymovirus at    resolution edited by t richmond
desmodium yellow mottle virus is a  nm diameter t   icosahedral plant virus of the tymovirus group its structure has been solved to a resolution of    using x ray diffraction analysis based on molecular replacement and phase extension methods the final r value was    rfree     for     independent reflections the folding of the polypeptide backbone is nearly identical with that of turnip yellow mosaic virus as is the arrangement of subunits in the virus capsid however a major difference in the disposition of the amino terminal ends of the subunits was observed in turnip yellow mosaic virus those from the b and c subunits comprising the hexameric capsomeres formed an annulus about the interior of the capsomere while the corresponding n termini of the pentameric capsomere a subunits were not visible at all in electron density maps in desmodium yellow mottle tymovirus amino termini from the a and b subunits combine to form the annuli thereby resulting in a much strengthened association between the two types of capsomeres and an apparently more stable capsid the first  residues of the c subunit were invisible in electron density maps two ordered fragments of single stranded rna seven and two nucleotides in length were observed the ordered water structure of the virus particle was delineated and required  solvent molecules per protein subunit
