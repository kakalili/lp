mutations in the n terminal region of reca that disrupt the stability of free protein oligomers but not reca dna complexes edited by m f moody
we have introduced targeted mutations in two areas that make up part of the reca subunit interface in the reca crystal structure cross subunit interactions are observed between the lys and asp  side chains and between the arg  and asn  side chains unexpectedly we find that mutations at lys and arg  impose severe defects on the oligomeric stability of free reca protein whereas mutations at asn  or asp  do not however lys and arg  mutant proteins showed an apparent normal formation of reca dna complexes these results suggest that cross subunit contacts in this region of the protein are different for free reca protein filaments versus reca dna nucleoprotein filaments mutant proteins with substitutions at either lys or arg  show partial inhibition of dna strand exchange activity yet the mechanistic reasons for this inhibition appear to be distinct although lys and arg  appear to be more important to the stability of free reca protein as opposed to the stability of the catalytically active nucleoprotein filament our results support the idea that the cross subunit interactions made by each residue play an important role in optimizing the catalytic organization of the active reca oligomer
