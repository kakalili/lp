an objective assessment of conformational variability in complexes of hepatitis c virus polymerase with non nucleoside inhibitors
a major target for antiviral therapy against hepatitis c virus hcv is the hcv polymerase nonstructural protein b ns b  huge efforts have been devoted to the development of nucleoside and non nucleoside inhibitors nnis of ns b an offshoot of these efforts has been the structural characterization of the interaction of ns b with nnis by x ray crystallography these works have shown that the conformation of recombinant ns b is very similar across strains constructs and complexes making evaluation of the long range conformational effects of nnis nontrivial using procedures appropriate to the evaluation of such minor but potentially important differences we objectively assessed the conformational diversity in the  available genotype b ns b structures in the protein data bank we find that there are  significantly different ns b conformations available but all are geometrically close to a closed rna synthesis initiation competent one within this fairly restricted range differences can be mapped to movements of ns b domains and subregions most of this information is actually defined by small but significant changes in complexes with nnis we thus establish rigorously the moving parts of the ns b molecular machine and the previously unrecognized hinge points that come into play upon nni binding we propose that nnis binding at three of the four distinct sites specifically inhibit the initiation step by the same mechanism they prevent ns b s  thumb  from quite reaching the proper initiation competent position furthermore we suggest that a small number of critical hinges in the ns b structure may emerge as sites of resistance mutations during future antiviral treatment
