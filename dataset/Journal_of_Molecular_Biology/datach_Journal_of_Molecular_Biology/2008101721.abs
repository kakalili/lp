importance of accurate dna structures in solution the jun  fos model
understanding the recognition of dna sequences by proteins requires an accurate description of the structural dynamics of free dna especially regarding indirect readout this involves subtle sequence dependent effects that are difficult to characterize in solution to progress in this area we applied nmr and extensive simulations to a dna sequence relevant to the jun  fos system the backbone and base behaviors demonstrate that unrestrained simulations with major force fields parm  parmbsc  and charmm  are not reliable enough for in silico predictions of detailed dna structures more realistic structures required molecular dynamics simulations supplemented by nmr restraints a new methodological element involved restraints inferred from the phosphate chemical shifts and from the phosphate dynamics this provided a detailed and dynamic view of the intrinsic properties of the free dna sequence that can be related to its recognition by comparison with a relevant dna  protein complex we show how to exploit the relationship between phosphate motions and helicoidal descriptors for structure determination toward an accurate description of dna structures and dynamics in solution
