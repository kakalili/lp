Analysis of Schizosaccharomyces pombe mutants that are defective in septum formation and cytokinesis has identified the product of the cdc15 gene as a key element in formation of a division septum. S. pombe cells lacking cdc15p function cannot assemble a functional medial ring, and do not make a division septum. cdc15 mRNA accumulates periodically during the cell cycle, peaking after entry into mitosis, and increased expression of the gene in G2-arrested cells can promote F-actin ring formation. Here, we have investigated the effects of mutations that block cell division upon the expression of cdc15 in synchronised cell populations, and analysed the expression of cdc15 when septum formation is induced by ectopic activation of the septation signalling network. We concluded the following: (i) the septation signalling network genes are not required for periodic accumulation of cdc15 mRNA; (ii) induction of septum formation in G2-arrested cells by activation of the septation signalling network does not result in accumulation of cdc15 mRNA, which is therefore not a prerequisite for septum formation; (iii) failure to turn off septum formation at the end of mitosis results in continued expression of cdc15; and (iv) periodic accumulation of cdc15 mRNA is mediated by a 97 bp region 5â€² to the mRNA start site.
