remote homology between munc  mun domain and vesicle tethering complexes
most core components of the neurotransmitter release machinery have homologues in other types of intracellular membrane traffic likely underlying a universal mechanism of intracellular membrane fusion however no clear similarity between munc s and protein families generally involved in membrane traffic has been reported despite the essential nature of munc s for neurotransmitter release this crucial function was ascribed to a minimal munc  region called the mun domain which likely participates in soluble n ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptor complex snare assembly and is also found in ca  dependent activator protein for secretion we have now used comparative sequence and structural analyses to study the structure and evolutionary origin of the mun domain we found weak yet significant sequence similarities between the mun domain and a set of protein subunits from several related vesicle tethering complexes such as sec from the exocyst complex and vps  from the golgi associated retrograde protein complex such an evolutionary relationship allows structure prediction of the mun domain and suggests functional similarities between mun domain containing proteins and multisubunit tethering complexes such as exocyst conserved oligomeric golgi complex golgi associated retrograde protein complex and dsl p these findings further unify the mechanism of neurotransmitter release with those of other types of intracellular membrane traffic and in turn support a role for tethering complexes in soluble n ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptor complex assembly
