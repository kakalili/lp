fast folding of the hiv  and siv gp  six helix bundles
human hiv  and simian siv immunodeficiency virus fusion with the host cell is promoted by the receptor triggered refolding of the gp  envelope protein into a stable trimer of hairpins structure that brings viral and cellular membranes into close proximity the core of this hairpin structure is a six helix bundle in which an inner homotrimeric coiled coil is buttressed by three antiparallel outer hr helices we have used stopped flow circular dichroism spectroscopy to characterize the unfolding and refolding kinetics of the six helix bundle using the hiv  and siv n  l c  polypeptides in each case the time course of ellipticity changes in refolding experiments is well described by a simple two state model involving the native trimer and the unfolded monomers the unfolding free energy of the hiv  and siv trimers and their urea dependence calculated from kinetic data are in very good agreement with data measured directly by isothermal unfolding experiments thus formation of the gp  six helix bundle structure involves no detectable population of stable partly folded intermediates folding of hiv  n  l c  is five orders of magnitudes faster than folding of its siv counterpart in aqueous buffer kon hiv      m  s   versus kon siv     m  s   the unfolding rates are similar koff hiv       s   versus koff siv      s   kinetic m values indicate that the transition state for folding of the hiv  protein is significantly more compact than the transition state of the siv protein replacement of a single siv threonine by isoleucine corresponding to position   in the hiv  sequence significantly stabilizes the protein and renders the folding rate close to that of the hiv  protein yet without making the transition state of the mutant as compact as that of the hiv  protein therefore the overall reduction of surface exposure in the high energy transition state seems not to account for different folding rates while the available biological evidence suggests that refolding of the gp  protein is slow our study implies that structural elements outside the trimer of hairpins limit the rate of hiv  fusion kinetics
