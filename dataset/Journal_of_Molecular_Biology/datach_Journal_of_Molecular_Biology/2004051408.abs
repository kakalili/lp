the    resolution crystal structure of  lytic protease reveals the detailed structure of the active site and identifies a source of conformational strain
the crystal structure of the extracellular bacterial serine protease  lytic protease  lp has been solved at    resolution at ph  this ultra high resolution structure allows accurate analysis of structural elements not possible with previous structures hydrogen atoms are visible and confirm active site hydrogen bonding interactions expected for the apo enzyme in particular his  n  participates in a normal hydrogen bond with asp  in the catalytic triad with a hydrogen atom visible        from the his n   the catalytic ser  occupies two conformations one corresponding to a population of his  that is doubly protonated the other to the singly protonated his  based on the occupancy of these conformations the pka of his  is calculated to be    when a sulfate ion occupies the active site this    structure has allowed critical analysis of geometric distortions within the structure interestingly phe  is significantly distorted from planarity the distortion of phe   buried in the core of the c terminal domain occurs at an estimated energetic cost of   kcal mol the conformational space for phe  is severely limited by the presence of trp   which prevents phe  from adopting the rotamer observed in many other chymotrypsin family members in  lp the only allowed rotamer leads to the deformation of phe  due to steric interactions with thr   we hypothesize that tight packing of co evolved residues in this region and the subsequent deformation of phe   contributes to the high cooperativity and large energetic barriers for folding and unfolding of  lp the kinetic stability imparted by the large cooperative unfolding barrier plays a critical role in extending the lifetime of the protease in its harsh environment
