domain flexibility modulates the heterogeneous assembly mechanism of anthrax toxin protective antigen
the three protein components of anthrax toxin are nontoxic individually but they form active holotoxin complexes upon assembly the role of the protective antigen pa component of the toxin is to deliver two other enzyme components lethal factor and edema factor across the plasma membrane and into the cytoplasm of target cells pa is produced as a proprotein which must be proteolytically activated generally cell surface activation is mediated by a furin family protease activated pa can then assemble into one of two noninterconverting oligomers a homoheptamer and a homooctamer which have unique properties herein we describe molecular determinants that influence the stoichiometry of pa in toxin complexes by tethering pa domain  d  to domain  with two different length cross links we can control the relative proportions of pa heptamers and octamers the longer cross link favors octamer formation whereas the shorter one favors formation of the heptamer x ray crystal structures of pa up to     resolution  including these cross linked pa constructs reveal that a hinge like movement of d correlates with the relative preference for each oligomeric architecture furthermore we report the conformation of the flexible loop containing the furin cleavage site and show that for efficient processing the furin site cannot be moved   or  residues within the loop we propose that there are different orientations of d relative to the main body of pa that favor the formation of either the heptamer or the octamer
