influence of dna end structure on the mechanism of initiation of dna unwinding by the escherichiacoli recbcd and recbc helicases
escherichia coli recbcd is a bipolar dna helicase possessing two motor subunits recb a   to   translocase and recd a   to   translocase that is involved in the major pathway of recombinational repair previous studies indicated that the minimal kinetic mechanism needed to describe the atp dependent unwinding of blunt ended dna by recbcd in vitro is a sequential n step mechanism with two to three additional kinetic steps prior to initiating dna unwinding since recbcd can  melt out     bp upon binding to the end of a blunt ended dna duplex in a mg  dependent but atp independent reaction we investigated the effects of noncomplementary single stranded ss dna tails    dt  and    dt  or    dt   on the mechanism of recbcd and recbc unwinding of duplex dna using rapid kinetic methods as with blunt ended dna recbcd unwinding of dna possessing    dt  and    dt  noncomplementary ssdna tails is well described by a sequential n step mechanism with the same unwinding rate mku     bp s   and kinetic step size m      bp  yet two to three additional kinetic steps are still required prior to initiation of dna unwinding kc    s    however when the noncomplementary   ssdna tail is extended to   nt    dt  and    dt   the dna end structure for which recbcd displays optimal binding affinity the additional kinetic steps are no longer needed although a slightly slower unwinding rate mku     bp s   is observed with a similar kinetic step size m      bp  the recbc dna helicase without the recd subunit does not initiate unwinding efficiently from a blunt dna end however recbc does initiate well from a dna end possessing noncomplementary twin    dt  and    dt  tails and unwinding can be described by a simple uniform n step sequential scheme without the need for the additional kc initiation steps with a similar kinetic step size m      bp and unwinding rate mkobs     bp s    these results suggest that the additional kinetic steps with rate constant kc required for recbcd to initiate unwinding of blunt ended and twin dt  tailed dna reflect processes needed to engage the recd motor with the   ssdna
