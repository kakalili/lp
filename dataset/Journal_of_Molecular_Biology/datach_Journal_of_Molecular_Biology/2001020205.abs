a ph sensitive rna tertiary interaction affects self cleavage activity of the hdv ribozymes in the absence of added divalent metal ion edited by j doudna
self cleavage of the genomic and antigenomic ribozymes from hepatitis delta virus hdv requires divalent cation for optimal activity recently the hdv genomic ribozyme has been shown to be active in nacl in the absence of added divalent metal ion at low ph apparent pka    however we find that the antigenomic ribozyme is   to   fold less active under similar conditions with deletion of a three nucleotide sequence c  a  a  unique to the genomic ribozyme the rate constant for cleavage decreased substantially while activity of the antigenomic ribozyme was enhanced by introducing a caa sequence from the crystal structure it has been proposed that c  in this sequence is protonated to investigate a possible connection between activity at low ph and protonation of c  mutations were made that were predicted to either eliminate protonation or alter the nature of the tertiary interaction upon protonation in the absence of added mg  these mutations reduced activity and eliminated the observed ph rate dependence thermal denaturation studies revealed a ph sensitive structural feature in the genomic ribozyme while unfolding of the mutant ribozymes was ph independent we propose that in the absence of added mg  protonation of c  contributes to enhanced activity of the hdv genomic ribozyme at low ph
