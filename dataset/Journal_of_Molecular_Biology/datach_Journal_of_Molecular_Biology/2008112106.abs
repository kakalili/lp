the crystal structure of jnk reveals conformational flexibility in the map kinase insert and indicates its involvement in the regulation of catalytic activity
c jun n terminal kinase jnk  is a member of the mitogen activated protein map kinase group of signaling proteins map kinases share a common sequence insertion called  map kinase insert   which for erk  has been shown to interact with regulatory proteins and for p   has been proposed to be involved in the regulation of catalytic activity we have determined the crystal structure of human jnk complexed with an indazole inhibitor by applying a high throughput protein engineering and surface site mutagenesis approach a novel conformation of the activation loop is observed which is not compatible with its phosphorylation by upstream kinases this activation inhibitory conformation of jnk is stabilized by the map kinase insert that interacts with the activation loop in an induced fit manner we therefore suggest that the map kinase insert of jnk plays a role in the regulation of jnk activation possibly by interacting with intracellular binding partners
