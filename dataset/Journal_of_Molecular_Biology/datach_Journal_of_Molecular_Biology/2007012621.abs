an anti urokinase plasminogen activator receptor upar antibody crystal structure and binding epitope
human urokinase type plasminogen activator receptor upar cd  is expressed at the invasive interface of the tumor stromal microenvironment in many human cancers and interacts with a wide array of extracellular molecules an anti upar antibody atn   was prepared using hybridoma technology this antibody binds to upar in vitro with high affinity kd    nm and does not interfere with upa binding to upar here we report the crystal structure of the fab fragment of atn  at     and the analysis of atn  supar atf structure that was previously determined emphasizing the atn   supar interaction the complementarity determining regions cdrs of atn  consist of a high percentage of aromatic residues and form a relatively flat and undulating surface the atn  fab fragment recognizes domain  of supar the antibody  antigen recognition involves  supar residues and  fab residues from five cdrs structural data suggest that pro   asn   gly   and arg  residues of upar are the key residues for the antibody recognition while pro  and arg  render specificity of atn  for human upar interestingly this antibody  antigen interface has a small contact area mainly polar interaction with little hydrophobic character yet has high binding strength furthermore several solvent molecules assigned as polyethylene glycols were clearly visible in the binding interface between antibody and antigen suggesting that solvent molecules may be important for the maximal binding between supar and atn  fab atn  undergoes small but noticeable changes in its cdr region upon antigen binding
