structural studies of streptococcus pyogenes streptolysin o provide insights into the early steps of membrane penetration
cholesterol dependent cytolysins cdcs are a large family of bacterial toxins that exhibit a dependence on the presence of membrane cholesterol in forming large pores in cell membranes significant changes in the three dimensional structure of these toxins are necessary to convert the soluble monomeric protein into a membrane pore we have determined the crystal structure of the archetypical member of the cdc family streptolysin o slo  a virulence factor from streptococcus pyogenes the overall fold is similar to previously reported cdc structures although the c terminal domain is in a different orientation with respect to the rest of the molecule surprisingly a signature stretch of cdc sequence called the undecapeptide motif a key region involved in membrane recognition adopts a very different structure in slo to that of the well characterized cdc perfringolysin o pfo  although the sequences in this region are identical an analysis reveals that in pfo there are complementary interactions between the motif and the rest of domain  that are lost in slo molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the loss of a salt bridge in slo and a cation  pi interaction are determining factors in the extended conformation of the motif which in turn appears to result in a greater flexibility of the neighboring l loop that houses a cholesterol sensing motif these differences may explain the differing abilities of slo and pfo to efficiently penetrate target cell membranes in the first step of toxin insertion into the membrane
