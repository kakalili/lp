Hypertonia, which is characterized by stiff gait, abnormal posture, jerky movements, and tremor, is associated with a number of neurological disorders, including cerebral palsy, dystonia, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and spinal cord injury. Recently, a spontaneous mutation in the gene encoding trafficking protein, kinesin-binding 1 (Trak1), was identified as the genetic defect that causes hypertonia in mice. The subcellular localization and biological function of Trak1 remain unclear. Here we report that Trak1 interacts with hepatocyte-growth-factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs), an essential component of the endosomal sorting and trafficking machinery. Double-label immunofluorescence confocal studies show that the endogenous Trak1 protein partially colocalizes with Hrs on early endosomes. Like Hrs, both overexpression and small-interfering-RNA-mediated knockdown of Trak1 inhibit degradation of internalized epidermal growth factor receptors through a block in endosome-to-lysosome trafficking. Our findings support a role for Trak1 in the regulation of Hrs-mediated endosomal sorting and have important implications for understanding hypertonia associated with neurological disorders.
