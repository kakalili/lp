role of e ring interactions in governing rnf mediated substrate ubiquitination
members of the really interesting new gene ring e ubiquitin ligase family bind to both substrate and ubiquitin charged e enzyme promoting the transfer of ubiquitin from the e to substrate either a single ubiquitin or one of the several types of polyubiquitin chains can be conjugated to substrate proteins with different types of ubiquitin modifications signaling the distinct outcomes e enzymes play a central role in governing the nature of the ubiquitin modification although the essential features of the e that differentiate mono versus polyubiquitinating e enzymes remain unclear rnf is a compact ring e ligase that directs the ubiquitination of polysumo chains in concert with several different e enzymes rnf monoubiquitinates polysumo substrates in concert with rad b and polyubiquitinates substrates together with ubch b a promiscuous e that can function with a broad range of e ligases we find that the divergent ubiquitination activities of rad b and ubch b are governed by differences at the ring binding surface of the e  by mutating the rad b ring binding surface to resemble that of ubch b rad b can be transformed into a highly active ubch b like e that polyubiquitinates sumo chains in concert with rnf  the switch in rad b activity correlates with increased affinity of the e for rnf  these results point to an important role of the affinity between an e and its cognate e in governing the multiplicity of substrate ubiquitination
