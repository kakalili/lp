observation of intersubunit movement of the ribosome in solution using fret
protein synthesis is believed to be a dynamic process involving structural rearrangements of the ribosome cryo em reconstructions of certain elongation factor g ef g containing complexes have led to the proposal that translocation of trna and mrna through the ribosome from the a to p to e sites is accompanied by a rotational movement between the two ribosomal subunits here we have used f rster resonance energy transfer fret to monitor changes in the relative orientation of the ribosomal subunits in different complexes trapped at intermediate stages of translocation in solution binding of ef g to the ribosome in the presence of the non hydrolyzable gtp analogue gdpnp or gtp plus fusidic acid causes an increase in the efficiency of energy transfer between fluorophores introduced into proteins s  in the   s subunit and l in the   s subunit and a decrease in energy transfer between s and l  similar anti correlated changes in energy transfer occur upon binding the gtp requiring release factor rf  these changes are consistent with the counter clockwise rotation of the   s subunit relative to the   s subunit observed in cryo em studies reaction of ribosomal complexes containing the peptidyl trna analogues n ac phe trnaphe n ac met trnamet or f met trnafmet with puromycin conditions favoring movement of the resulting deacylated trnas into the p e hybrid state leads to similar changes in fret conversely treatment of a ribosomal complex containing deacylated and peptidyl trnas bound in the a p and p e states respectively with ef g gtp causes reversal of the fret changes the use of fret has enabled direct observation of intersubunit movement in solution provides independent evidence that formation of the hybrid state is coupled to rotation of the   s subunit and shows that the intersubunit movement is reversed during the second step of translocation
