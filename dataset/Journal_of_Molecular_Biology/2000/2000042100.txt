A 12 Å resolution three-dimensional density map of the Haliotis tuberculata hemocyanin type 1 (HtH1) didecamer has been obtained by cryoelectron microscopy of unstained molecules and angular reconstitution. The dyad symmetry of the 8 MDa D5 HtH1 didecamer, formed by the pairing of two asymmetric 4 MDa ring-like C5 decamers, is emphasised. The major and minor surface helical grooves of the didecamer are well defined, in agreement with earlier data on molluscan hemocyanins. The location of the obliquely orientated repeating unit, a subunit dimer, within the decamer has been defined. Following interactive extraction of this dimer, several new structural features of the dimer and of the subunit have now emerged with improved detail. The subunit dimer possesses pseudo 2-fold symmetry, resulting from the steric arrangement of the wall domains/functional units (FUs-abcdef) of the two subunits. The arc and collar FUs (g and h) depart from this inherent 2-fold symmetry and are thereby responsible for the asymmetry of the C5 decamer, with the internalised collar/arc complex at one edge of the decamer. The FU heterodimers forming the wall morphological units have a hollow centre, and thus create a series of repeating channels that extend within the wall through all three tiers of the decamer. The connections between the wall and the arc are defined with improved clarity, and evidence is provided to indicate that the arc and collar FU pairs have a homodimeric composition (gg and hh, respectively). Two possibilities for the subunit path within the subunit dimer are presented, which correlate with the available structural, immunolabelling and protease cleavage data from HtH1 and other molluscan hemocyanins.
