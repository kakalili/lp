crystal structures of a poplar thioredoxin peroxidase that exhibits the structure of glutathione peroxidases insights into redox driven conformational changes
glutathione peroxidases gpxs are a group of enzymes that regulate the levels of reactive oxygen species in cells and tissues and protect them against oxidative damage contrary to most of their counterparts in animal cells the higher plant gpx homologues identified so far possess cysteine instead of selenocysteine in their active site interestingly the plant gpxs are not dependent on glutathione but rather on thioredoxin as their in vitro electron donor we have determined the crystal structures of the reduced and oxidized form of populus trichocarpa deltoides gpx  ptgpx  using a selenomethionine derivative ptgpx exhibits an overall structure similar to that of the known animal gpxs ptgpx crystallized in the assumed physiological dimeric form displaying a pseudo ten stranded  sheet core comparison of both redox structures indicates that a drastic conformational change is necessary to bring the two distant cysteine residues together to form an intramolecular disulfide bond in addition a computer model of a complex of ptgpx and its in vitro recycling partner thioredoxin h is proposed on the basis of the crystal packing of the oxidized form enzyme a possible role of ptgpx as a heavy metal sink is also discussed
