phosphorylation of acanthamoeba actophorin adf cofilin blocks interaction with actin without a change in atomic structure edited by m f moody
lim kinase activated by gst pak phosphorylates acanthamoeba actophorin stoichiometrically and specifically on serine  the atomic structure of phosphorylated actophorin determined by x ray crystallography is essentially identical with the structure of unphosphorylated actophorin we compared biochemical properties of phosphorylated actophorin unphosphorylated actophorin and mutants of actophorin with serine  replaced by aspartic acid or alanine phosphorylation strongly inhibits interaction of actophorin with mg adp or mg atp actin monomers and mg adp actin filaments so ser phosphorylation directly blocks interaction of actin depolymerizing factor adf cofilin proteins with actin about   of actophorin is phosphorylated in live amoebas grown in suspension culture phosphorylation of adf cofilin proteins by lim kinase or other enzymes will tend to stabilize actin filaments by inhibiting the ability of these proteins to sever and depolymerize older actin filaments that have hydrolyzed their bound atp and dissociated the phosphate
