crystal structure of the extracellular domain of a bacterial ligand gated ion channel
the crystal structure of the extracellular domain ecd of the pentameric ligand gated ion channel from gloeobacter violaceus glic was solved at neutral ph at     resolution in two crystal forms showing a surprising hexameric quaternary structure with a  fold axis replacing the expected  fold axis while each subunit retains the usual  sandwich immunoglobulin like fold small deviations from the whole glic structure indicate zones of differential flexibility the changes in interface between two adjacent subunits in the pentamer and the hexamer can be described in a downward translation by one inter strand distance and a global rotation of the second subunit using the first one for superposition while global characteristics of the interface such as the buried accessible surface area do not change very much most of the atom  atom interactions are rearranged it thus appears that the transmembrane domain is necessary for the proper oligomeric assembly of glic and that there is an intrinsic plasticity or polymorphism in possible subunit  subunit interfaces at the ecd level the latter behaving as a monomer in solution possible functional implications of these novel structural data are discussed in the context of the allosteric transition of this family of proteins in addition we propose a novel way to quantify elastic energy stored in the interface between subunits which indicates a tenser interface for the open form than for the closed form rest state  the hexameric or pentameric forms of the ecd have a similar negative curvature in their subunit  subunit interface while acetylcholine binding proteins have a smaller and positive curvature that increases from the apo to the holo form
