hiv  infection induces acetylation of npm that facilitates tat localization and enhances viral transactivation
human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  following integration hijacks host cell machineries where chromatinization of the viral genome regulates its latency transcription and replication the cooperation among atp dependent chromatin remodeling factors posttranslational modifying enzymes and histone chaperones is well established during transcriptional activation in eukaryotes however the role of histone chaperones in transcription of the hiv promoter is poorly understood previous studies from our group have established the role of the human histone chaperone nucleophosmin npm  in the acetylation dependent chromatin transcription npm is known to interact with hiv tat here we report that infection by hiv  induces the acetylation of histone chaperone npm  acetylation of npm was found to be critical for nuclear localization of tat as well as tat mediated transcription alluding to the critical role for the host factor towards viral pathogenesis furthermore knockdown experiments mediated by small interfering rna identified the critical role played by the chaperone npm in transcriptional activation of the integrated provirus these results shed further insights into the possible role of histone chaperone npm acetylation in viral gene transcription which could be a potential therapeutic target
