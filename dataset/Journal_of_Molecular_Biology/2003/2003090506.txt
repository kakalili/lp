Methionyl aminopeptidases (MetAPs) represent a unique class of protease that are responsible for removing the N-terminal methionine residue from proteins and peptides. There are two major classes of MetAPs (type I and type II) described and each class can be subdivided into two subclasses. Eukaryotes contain both the type I and type II MetAPs, whereas prokaryotes possess only the type I enzyme. Due to the physiological importance of these enzymes there is considerable interest in inhibitors to be used as antiangiogenic and antimicrobial agents. Here, we describe the 1.15Å crystal structure of the Staphylococcus aureus MetAP-I as an apo-enzyme and its complexes with various 1,2,4-triazole-based derivatives at high-resolution. The protein has a typical “pita-bread” fold as observed for the other MetAP structures. The inhibitors bind in the active site with the N1 and N2 atoms of the triazole moiety complexing two divalent ions. The 1,2,4-triazols represent a novel class of potent non-peptidic inhibitors for the MetAP-Is.
