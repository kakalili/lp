structural and mechanical hierarchies in the  crystallin domain dimer of the hyperthermophilic small heat shock protein hsp
in biological systems proteins rarely act as isolated monomers association to dimers or higher oligomers is a commonly observed phenomenon as an example small heat shock proteins form spherical homo oligomers of mostly  subunits with the dimeric  crystallin domain as the basic structural unit the structural hierarchy of this complex is key to its function as a molecular chaperone in this article we analyze the folding and association of the basic building block the  crystallin domain dimer from the hyperthermophilic archaeon methanocaldococcus jannaschii hsp   in detail equilibrium denaturation experiments reveal that the  crystallin domain dimer is highly stable against chemical denaturation in these experiments protein dissociation and unfolding appear to follow an  all or none  mechanism with no intermediate monomeric species populated when the mechanical stability was determined by single molecule force spectroscopy we found that the  crystallin domain dimer resists high forces when pulled at its termini in contrast to bulk denaturation stable monomeric unfolding intermediates could be directly observed in the mechanical unfolding traces after the  crystallin domain dimer had been dissociated by force our results imply that for this hyperthermophilic member of the small heat shock protein family assembly of the spherical  mer starts from folded monomers which readily associate to the dimeric structure required for assembly of the higher oligomer
