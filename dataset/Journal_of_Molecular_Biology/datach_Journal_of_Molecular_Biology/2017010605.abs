near atomic resolution structure determination of a cypovirus capsid and polymerase complex using cryo em at  kv
single particle cryo electron microscopy cryo em allows the high resolution structural determination of biological assemblies in a near native environment however all high resolution better than    cryo em structures reported to date were obtained by using  kv transmission electron microscopes tems  we report here the structures of a cypovirus capsid of    diameter at    resolution and of rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp complexes within the capsid at    resolution using a   kv tem the newly resolved structure revealed conformational changes of two subdomains in the rdrp these conformational changes which were involved in rdrp s switch from non transcribing to transcribing mode suggest that the rdrp may facilitate the unwinding of genomic double stranded rna the possibility of   resolution structural determinations for biological assemblies of relatively small sizes using cryo em at  kv was discussed
