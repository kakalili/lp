identification of a guaay pentaloop sequence involved in a novel rna loop  helix interaction
large rnas often utilize gnra tetraloops as structural elements to stabilize the overall tertiary fold these tetraloop  receptor tr interactions have a conserved geometry in which the tetraloop docks into the receptor at an angle of    from the helix containing the receptor here we show that the conserved guaay pentaloop found in domain iii of group iib introns participates in a novel class of rna tertiary interaction with a geometry and mode of binding that are significantly different from that found in gnra tr interactions this pentaloop is highly conserved within the iib class and interacts with the minor groove of the catalytic domain v the base planes of the loop and receptor nucleotides are not coplanar and greatly deviate from standard a minor motifs the helical axis of the guaay stem loop diverges    from the angle of insertion found in a typical gnra tr interaction therefore the loop architecture and insertion orientation are distinctive with in vitro splicing data indicating that a gnra tetraloop is incompatible at this position the guaay pentaloop  receptor motif is also found in the structure of the eukaryotic thiamine pyrophosphate riboswitch in the context of a hexanucleotide loop sequence we therefore propose based on phylogenetic structural and biochemical data that the guaay pentaloop  receptor interaction represents a novel structural motif that is present in multiple structured rnas
