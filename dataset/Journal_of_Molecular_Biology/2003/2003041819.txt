The DNA-binding domain (DBD) of the ubiquituous transcription factor Sp1 consists of three consecutive zinc fingers that recognize a number of nucleotide sequences different from, but related to and sometimes overlapping, those recognized by the structurally better characterized early growth response protein 1 (EGR1, also known as Zif268, Krox-24, and NGFI-A). The accepted consensus binding sequence for Sp1 is usually defined by the asymmetric hexanucleotide core GGGCGG but this sequence does not include, among others, the GAG (=CTC) repeat that constitutes a high-affinity site for Sp1 binding to the wt1 promoter. Since no 3D structure of the whole DBD of Sp1 is available, either alone or in complex with DNA, a homology-based model was built and its interaction with two DNA 14-mers was studied using nanosecond molecular dynamics simulations in the presence of explicit water molecules. These oligonucleotides represent Sp1 target sites that are present in the promoters of the mdr1 and wt1 genes. For comparative purposes and validation of the protocol, the complex between the DBD of EGR1 and its DNA target site within the proximal mdr1 promoter was simulated under the same conditions. Some water molecules were seen to play an important role in recognition and stabilization of the proteinâ€“DNA complexes. Our results, which are supported by the available experimental evidence, suggest that the accuracy in the prediction of putative Sp1-binding sites can be improved by interpreting a set of rules, which are a blend of both stringency and tolerance, for the juxtaposed triplet subsites to which each zinc finger binds. Our approach can be extrapolated to WT1 and other related natural or artificial zinc-finger-containing DNA-binding proteins and may aid in the assignment of particular DNA stretches as allowed or disallowed-binding sites.
