structural and kinetic properties of a  hydroxyacid dehydrogenase involved in nicotinate fermentation
hydroxymethyl glutarate dehydrogenase the fourth enzyme of the anaerobic nicotinate fermentation pathway of eubacterium barkeri catalyzes the nadh dependent conversion between s  formylglutarate and s   hydroxymethyl glutarate as shown by its    crystal structure this enzyme is a novel member of the  hydroxyacid dehydrogenase family and adopts a tetrameric architecture with monomers interacting via their c terminal catalytic domains the nad binding domains protrude heterogeneously from the central tetrameric core with domain rotation angles differing up to    kinetic properties of the enzyme including nadh inhibition constants were determined a strong nadh binding in contrast to weaker nad binding of the protein was inferred from fluorometrically determined binding constants for the dinucleotide cofactor the data support either an iso ordered bi bi mechanism or a more common ordered bi bi mechanism as found in other dehydrogenases
