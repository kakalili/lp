interaction surface of the transcription terminator rho required to form a complex with the c terminal domain of the antiterminator nusg
rho dependent transcription termination in bacteria requires an interaction between the terminator rho and the antiterminator nusg the interaction surface of the rho  nusg complex is unknown here we provide direct evidence that the  sheet bundle of the c terminal domain of nusg nusg ctd has the binding determinants for rho proving the hypothesis described earlier mooney r a  schweimer k  rosch p  gottesman m  amp landick r      two structurally independent domains of e coli nusg create regulatory plasticity via distinct interactions with rna polymerase and regulators j mol biol           disulfide bridges can be engineered from nusg ctd with the surface exposed amino acids   and   of rho which belong to its p loop atpase domain mutational analyses of this region of rho revealed that a hydrophobic pocket located behind these amino acids of rho is the docking site for nusg ctd the proximity of this region of rho to nusg ctd in the rho  nusg complex was also confirmed by an efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer between residue k  of rho and residue a  of nusg ctd the identification of the rho  nusg interaction surface will be useful not only in understanding the role of nusg in the termination process but also in explaining the molecular basis of the involvement of nusg ctd in recruiting rho and the ribosome to the same transcription machinery
