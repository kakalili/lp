the macromolecular assembly of pathogen recognition receptors is impelled by serine proteases via their complement control protein modules
although the innate immune response is triggered by the formation of a stable assembly of pathogen recognition receptors prrs onto the pathogens the driving force that enables this prr  prr interaction is unknown here we show that serine proteases which are activated during infection participate in associating with the prrs inhibition of serine proteases gravely impairs the prr assembly using yeast two hybrid and pull down methods we found that two serine proteases in the horseshoe crab carcinoscorpius rotundicauda are able to bind to the following three core members of prrs galactose binding protein carcinolectin  and c reactive protein these two serine proteases are   factor c which activates the coagulation pathway and   c bf a protein from the complement pathway by systematic molecular dissection we show that these serine proteases interact with the core  pathogen recognition complex  via their complement control protein modules
