alanine scanning and fe babe probing of the bacteriophage   prohead rna  connector interaction
the dna packaging motor of the bacillus subtilis bacteriophage   prohead is comprised in part of an oligomeric ring of   base rna molecules prna positioned near the n termini of subunits of the dodecameric head  tail connector deletion and alanine substitution mutants in the connector protein gp  n terminus were assembled into proheads in escherichia coli and the particles tested for prna binding and dna  gp packaging in vitro the basic amino acid residues rkr at positions    of the gp  n terminus were central to prna binding during assembly of an active dna packaging motor conjugation of iron s   p bromoacetamidobenzyl ethylenediaminetetraacetate fe babe to residue s  c in the narrow end of the connector near the n terminus permitted hydroxyl radical probing of bound  p prna and identified two discrete sites proximal to this residue the c helix at the junction of the a c and d helices and the e helix and the ce loop d loop of the intermolecular base pairing site
