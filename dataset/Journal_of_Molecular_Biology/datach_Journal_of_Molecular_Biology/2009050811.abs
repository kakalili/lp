elucidating the inhibition mechanism of hiv  non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors through multicopy molecular dynamics simulations
human immunodeficiency virus  reverse transcriptase rt inhibition is a major focus of current anti aids drug discovery and development programs comprising  of the  food and drug administration approved compounds the emergence of the non nucleoside rt inhibitor nnrti class of compounds provides a highly specific and structurally diverse set of drugs which act noncompetitively to perturb normal rt function despite a relatively rich set of crystallographic data of rt in various states details of the allosteric modulation of rt dynamics by nnrtis are lacking capturing this inhibitory mechanism could fuel the design of more effective inhibitors at the nnrti site and also drive the identification of novel allosteric sites to address this we have performed multicopy molecular dynamics md simulations of rt in the presence and absence of the nnrti nevirapine cumulative total simulation time    ns  by comparing the collective motions of the md and crystallographic structures we demonstrate that the chief effect of nnrtis is to constrain a key rigid body motion between the  fingers  and  thumb  subdomains of the p  subunit we show that the nnrti binding pocket nnibp is proximal to the hinge points for this essential motion and nnrtis therefore act as  molecular wedges   sterically blocking the full range of motion to explain how this impaired movement might result in the experimentally observed loss of polymerase activity we show that the motion influences the geometry of key catalytic residues on opposite faces of the nnibp from a methodological point of view our results suggest that the multicopy md simulation approach is very useful when studying proteins that perform such large conformational changes
