the hierarchy of korb binding at its  binding sites on the broad host range plasmid rk and modulation of this binding by incc protein edited by j karn
incc and korb proteins of broad host range plasmid rk are members of the para parb families of proteins needed for stable partitioning of bacterial chromosomes and plasmids korb also functions as a global regulator of expression of rk genes it recognises and binds to a palindromic operator ob found  times on rk dna ob ob   we performed detailed studies on the binding of korb to the  operators and showed that they fall into three groups a b c based on the binding strength of korb the highest affinity site is ob  which occurs in the promoter transcribing genes for replication trfap purified incc potentiated korb binding to all ob sites except ob  a site involved in partitioning using ob  as a test system we showed that incc increases the stability of the korb dna complex the  bp sequences flanking the  mer ob site were found to affect korb binding and incc potentiation activity study of hybrid operators indicated that flanking sequences on one side only were sufficient to specify the difference between ob  and ob  replacement of adenine by guanine at positions   and    from the ob  centre of symmetry was needed to convert it from the highest affinity group a to the medium affinity group b on the basis of korb binding these changes also eliminated potentiation by incc  the   and    positions from the centre of ob symmetry are occupied by guanines and this may provide part of the specificity of incc behaviour on korb binding studies on a series of synthetic operators suggested that korb contacts ob flanking sequences and that incc may alter the conformation of multimeric korb so that it is better able to make these contacts thus stabilising the complexes once formed
