solution structure divalent metal and dna binding of the endonuclease domain from the replication initiation protein from porcine circovirus
circoviruses are the smallest circular single stranded dna viruses able to replicate in mammalian cells essential to their replication is the replication initiator or rep protein that initiates the rolling circle replication rcr of the viral genome here we report the nmr solution three dimensional structure of the endonuclease domain from the rep protein of porcine circovirus type  pcv  the causative agent of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome in swine the domain comprises residues     of the full length protein and exhibits the fold described previously for the rep protein of the representative geminivirus tomato yellow leaf curl sardinia virus the structure however differs significantly in some secondary structure elements that decorate the central five stranded  sheet including the replacement of a  hairpin by an  helix in pcv rep the identification of the divalent metal binding site was accomplished by following the paramagnetic broadening of nmr amide signals upon mn  titration the site comprises three conserved acidic residues on the exposed face of the central  sheet for the   complex of the pcv rep nuclease domain with a  mer double stranded dna oligonucleotide chemical shift mapping allowed the identification of the dna binding site on the protein and aided in constructing a model of the protein dna complex
