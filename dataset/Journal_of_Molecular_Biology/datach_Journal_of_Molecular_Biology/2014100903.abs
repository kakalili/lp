chromatin regulation of dna damage repair and genome integrity in the central nervous system
with the continued extension of lifespan aging and age related diseases have become a major medical challenge to our society aging is accompanied by changes in multiple systems among these the aging process in the central nervous system is critically important but very poorly understood neurons as post mitotic cells are devoid of replicative associated aging processes such as senescence and telomere shortening however because of the inability to self replenish neurons have to withstand challenge from numerous stressors over their lifetime many of these stressors can lead to damage of the neurons dna when the accumulation of dna damage exceeds a neuron s capacity for repair or when there are deficiencies in dna repair machinery genome instability can manifest the increased mutation load associated with genome instability can lead to neuronal dysfunction and ultimately to neuron degeneration in this review we first briefly introduce the sources and types of dna damage and the relevant repair pathways in the nervous system summarized in fig   we then discuss the chromatin regulation of these processes and summarize our understanding of the contribution of genomic instability to neurodegenerative diseases
