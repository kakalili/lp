structural and functional analysis of methylation and   rna sequence requirements of short capped rnas by the methyltransferase domain of dengue virus ns
the n terminal   kda domain of non structural protein  ns  of dengue virus dv  named ns mtasedv is involved in two of four steps required for the formation of the viral mrna cap megpppa  ome the guanine n and the adenosine   o methylation its s adenosyl l methionine adomet dependent   o methyltransferase mtase activity has been shown on capped me gpppacn rnas here we report structural and binding studies using cap analogues and capped rnas we have solved five crystal structures at     to     resolution of ns mtasedv in complex with cap analogues and the co product of methylation s adenosyl l homocysteine adohcy  the cap analogues can adopt several conformations the guanosine moiety of all cap analogues occupies a gtp  binding site identified earlier indicating that gtp and cap share the same binding site accordingly we show that binding of megpppac and megpppac rnas is inhibited in the presence of gtp  megtp and megpppa but not by atp this particular position of the cap is in accordance with the   o methylation step a model was generated of a ternary   o methylation complex of ns mtasedv  megpppa and adomet rna binding increased when me gpppagcn  starting with the consensus sequence gpppag was used instead of me gpppacn in the ns mtasedv  gpppa complex the cap analogue adopts a folded stacked conformation uniquely possible when adenine is the first transcribed nucleotide at the   end of nascent rna as it is the case in all flaviviruses this conformation cannot be a functional intermediate of methylation since both the guanine n and adenosine   o positions are too far away from adomet we hypothesize that this conformation mimics the reaction product of a yet to be demonstrated guanylyltransferase activity a putative flavivirus rna capping pathway is proposed combining the different steps where the ns mtase domain is involved
