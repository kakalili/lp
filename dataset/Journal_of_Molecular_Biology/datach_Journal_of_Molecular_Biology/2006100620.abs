the c domain of pkc  is a ca  dependent ptdins   p sensing domain a new insight into an old pathway
the c domain is a targeting domain that responds to intracellular ca  signals in classical protein kinases pkcs and mediates the translocation of its host protein to membranes recent studies have revealed a new motif in the c domain named the lysine rich cluster that interacts with acidic phospholipids the purpose of this work was to characterize the molecular mechanism by which ptdins   p specifically interacts with this motif using a combination of isothermal titration calorimetry fluorescence resonance energy transfer and time lapse confocal microscopy we show here that ca  specifically binds to the ca  binding region facilitating ptdins   p access to the lysine rich cluster the magnitude of ptdins   p binding is greater than in the case of other polyphosphate phosphatidylinositols very importantly the residues involved in ptdins   p binding are essential for the plasma membrane localization of pkc  when rbl h cells are stimulated through their ige receptors additionally cfp ph and cfp c domains were used as bioprobes to demonstrate the co existence of ptdins   p and diacylglycerol in the plasma membrane and it was shown that although a fraction of ptdins   p is hydrolyzed to generate diacylglycerol and ip  an important amount still remains in the membrane where it is available to activate pkc  these findings entail revision of the currently accepted model of pkc  recruitment to the membrane and its activation
