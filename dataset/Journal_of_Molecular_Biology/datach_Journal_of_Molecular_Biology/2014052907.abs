assembly of robust bacterial microcompartment shells using building blocks from an organelle of unknown function
bacterial microcompartments bmcs sequester enzymes from the cytoplasmic environment by encapsulation inside a selectively permeable protein shell bioinformatic analyses indicate that many bacteria encode bmc clusters of unknown function and with diverse combinations of shell proteins the genome of the halophilic myxobacterium haliangium ochraceum encodes one of the most atypical sets of shell proteins in terms of composition and primary structure we found that microcompartment shells could be purified in high yield when all seven h ochraceum bmc shell genes were expressed from a synthetic operon in escherichia coli these shells differ substantially from previously isolated shell systems in that they are considerably smaller and more homogeneous with measured diameters of   nm the size and nearly uniform geometry allowed the development of a structural model for the shells composed of   hexagonal units and  hexagons per icosahedral face we found that new proteins could be recruited to the shells by fusion to a predicted targeting peptide sequence setting the stage for the use of these remarkably homogeneous shells for applications such as three dimensional scaffolding and the construction of synthetic bmcs our results demonstrate the value of selecting from the diversity of bmc shell building blocks found in genomic sequence data for the construction of novel compartments
