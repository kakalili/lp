akap  contains a phosphoesterase domain that binds amp
protein kinase a anchoring proteins akaps  defined by their capacity to target the camp dependent protein kinase to distinct subcellular locations function as molecular scaffolds mediating the assembly of multicomponent complexes to integrate and organise multiple signalling events despite their central importance in regulating cellular processes little is known regarding their diverse structures and molecular mechanisms here using bioinformatics and x ray crystallography we define a central domain of akap   akap cd as a member of the h phosphoesterase family the domain features two conserved his x thr motifs positioned at the base of a groove located between two lobes related by pseudo  fold symmetry nucleotide co crystallisation screening revealed that this groove binds specifically to adenosine  monophosphate  amp and cytosine  monophosphate  cmp  with the affinity constant for amp in the physiological concentration range this is the first example of an akap capable of binding a small molecule our data generate two functional hypotheses for the akap  central domain it may act as a phosphoesterase although we did not identify a substrate or as an amp sensor with the potential to couple intracellular amp levels to pka signalling events
