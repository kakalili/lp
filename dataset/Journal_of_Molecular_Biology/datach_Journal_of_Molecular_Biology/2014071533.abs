suspect enhanced prediction of single amino acid variant sav phenotype using network features
whole genome and exome sequencing studies reveal many genetic variants between individuals some of which are linked to disease many of these variants lead to single amino acid variants savs  and accurate prediction of their phenotypic impact is important incorporating sequence conservation and network level features we have developed a method suspect disease susceptibility based sav phenotype prediction  for predicting how likely savs are to be associated with disease suspect performs significantly better than other available batch methods on the varibench benchmarking dataset with a balanced accuracy of   suspect is available at www sbg bio ic ac uk suspect the web site has been implemented in perl and sqlite and is compatible with modern browsers an sqlite database of possible missense variants in the human proteome is available to download at www sbg bio ic ac uk suspect download html
