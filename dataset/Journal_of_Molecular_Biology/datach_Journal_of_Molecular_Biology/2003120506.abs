overlap of nuclear localisation signal and specific dna binding residues within the zinc finger domain of pacc
the transcription factor pacc mediating regulation of gene expression by ambient ph in the genetically amenable fungus aspergillus nidulans contains a three zinc finger dna binding domain zf dbd including a nuclear localisation signal nls  we selected  novel mutations impairing pacc function of which  missense mutations identify individual residues essential for zf dbd structure function our functional analysis agrees with our previous conclusion that finger  does not bind dna and provides in vivo evidence that trp  and trp   located in the cys knuckles of adjacent zinc fingers are critical for zf dbd structure function in the finger   helix gln     is specifically involved in contacting dna while the major role of lys     resides in the nuclear localisation of the protein in contrast lys  is essential for dna binding and for nuclear localisation as finger  suffices to drive nuclear localisation of green fluorescent protein we conclude that it contains an nls including essential lys  and lys   these residues are within an  helical basic sequence that is completely conserved amongst zinc fingers of the pacc rim  family and present in an identical position of the last finger  helix of drosophila cubitus interruptus where it is also involved in nuclear localisation we propose that pacc and gli ci zf dbds belong to a subclass of these domains characterised by possession of a pair of conserved trp residues involved in the interaction between the two most n terminal fingers and the presence of an nls in the  helix of the most c terminal finger loss of pacc nuclear localisation resulting from his  leu   strand and phe  ser hydrophobic core substitutions in finger  suggests that its folding is required for nls function overlap of dna binding and nls may aid release of pacc from its cognate importer s upon nuclear translocation as suggested for zinc binuclear cluster proteins
