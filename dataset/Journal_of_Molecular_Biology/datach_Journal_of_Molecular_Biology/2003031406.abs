design and characterization of a hyperstable p ink a that restores cdk binding activity when combined with oncogenic mutations
cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p ink a is the founding member of the ink family of tumor suppressors capable of arresting mammalian cell division missense mutations in the p ink a gene ink a cdkn a mts  are strongly linked to several types of human cancer these mutations are evenly distributed throughout this small ankyrin repeat protein and the majority of them disrupt the native secondary and or tertiary structure leading to protein unfolding aggregation and loss of function we report here the use of multiple stabilizing substitutions to increase the stability of p ink a and furthermore to restore cdk binding activity of several defective cancer related mutant proteins stabilizing substitutions were predicted using four different techniques the three most effective substitutions were combined to create a hyperstable p ink a variant that is  kcal mol more stable than wild type this engineered construct is monomeric in solution with wild type like secondary and tertiary structure and cyclin dependent kinase  binding activity interestingly these hyperstable substitutions when combined with oncogenic mutations r p p l or v  d can significantly restore cdk binding activity despite the divergent features of each destabilizing mutation extensive biophysical studies indicate that the hyperstable substitutions enhance the binding activity of mutant p  through several different mechanisms including an increased amount of secondary structure and thermostability reduction in exposed hydrophobic surface s and or a reduced tendency to aggregate this apparent global suppressor effect suggests that increasing the thermodynamic stability of p  can be used as a general strategy to restore the biological activity to defective mutants of this important tumor suppressor protein
