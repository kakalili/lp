substitution of asp  or arg  in the fingers domain of moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase affects interactions with the template primer resulting in decreased processivity
reverse transcriptase an essential retroviral dna polymerase replicates the single stranded rna genome of the retrovirus producing a double stranded dna copy which is subsequently integrated into the host s genome substitution of ala for either asp  or arg   two highly conserved residues in the fingers domain of moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase results in enzymes d  a or r  a with significant defects in their abilities to processively synthesize dna using rna or dna as a template d  a and r  a enzymes also bind more weakly to template primer in the presence of added deoxyribonucleotides as seen by gel shift analysis but retain the ability to strand transfer and accumulate smaller rnase h cleavage products when compared to the wild type enzyme in addition mutant proviruses including d  a and r  a substitutions in moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase are not viable despite the presence of processed reverse transcriptase in the viral particles a potential mechanistic role in processive synthesis for d  and r  is discussed in the context of our results related studies on hiv  reverse transcriptase and previous structural studies
