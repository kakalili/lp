molecular genetic and physiological characterisation of dystrobrevin like dyb  mutants of caenorhabditis elegans edited by j karn
dystrobrevins are protein components of the dystrophin complex whose disruption leads to duchenne muscular dystrophy and related diseases the caenorhabditis elegans dystrobrevin gene dyb  encodes a protein   identical with its mammalian counterparts the c elegans dystrobrevin is expressed in muscles and neurons we characterised c elegans dyb  mutants and showed that   their behavioural phenotype resembles that of dystrophin dys  mutants   the phenotype of dyb  dys  double mutants is not different from the single ones   dyb  mutants are more sensitive than wild type animals to reductions of acetylcholinesterase levels and have an increased response to acetylcholine   dyb  mutations alone do not lead to muscle degeneration but synergistically produce a progressive myopathy when combined with a mild myod hlh  mutation all together these findings further substantiate the role of dystrobrevins in cholinergic transmission and as functional partners of dystrophin
