The folding rates of two-state single-domain proteins are generally resistant to small-scale changes in amino acid sequence. For example, having surveyed here over 700 single-residue substitutions in 24 well-characterized two-state proteins, we find that the majority (55%) of these substitutions affect folding rates by less than a factor of 2, and that only 9% affect folding rates by more than a factor of 8. Among those substitutions that significantly affect folding rates, we find that accelerating substitutions are an order of magnitude less common than those that decelerate the process. One of the most extreme outliers in this data set, an arginine-to-phenylalanine substitution at position 48 (R48F) of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2), accelerates the protein's folding rate by a factor of 36 relative to that of the wild-type protein and is the most accelerating substitution reported to date in a two-state protein. In order to better understand the origins of this anomalous behavior, we have characterized the kinetics of multiple additional substitutions at this position. We find that substitutions at position 48 in CI2 fall into two distinct classes. The first, comprising residues that ablate the charge of the wild-type arginine but retain the hydrophobicity of its alkane chain, accelerate folding by at least 10-fold. The second class, comprising all other residues, produces folding rates within a factor of two of the wild-type rate. A significant positive correlation between hydrophobicity and folding rate across all of the residues we have characterized at this position suggests that the hydrophobic methylene units of the wild-type arginine play a significant role in stabilizing the folding transition state. Likewise, studies of the pH dependence of the histidine substitution indicate a strong correlation between folding rate and charge state. Thus, mutations that ablate the arginine's positive charge while retaining the hydrophobic contacts of its methylene units tend to dramatically accelerate folding. Previous studies have suggested that arginine 48 plays an important functional role in CI2, which may explain why it is highly conserved despite the anomalously large deceleration it produces in the folding of this protein.
