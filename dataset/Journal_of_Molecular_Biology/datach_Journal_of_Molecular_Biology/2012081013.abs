sensitivity of amyloid formation by human islet amyloid polypeptide to mutations at residue
islet amyloid polypeptide iapp amylin is responsible for amyloid formation in type  diabetes and in islet cell transplants the only known natural mutation found in mature human iapp is a ser  to gly missense mutation found with small frequency in chinese and japanese populations the mutation appears to be associated with increased risk of early onset type  diabetes early measurements in the presence of organic co solvents showed that s g iapp formed amyloid more quickly than the wild type we confirm that the mutant accelerates amyloid formation under a range of conditions including in the absence of co solvents ser  adopts a normal backbone geometry and the side chain makes no steric clashes in models of iapp amyloid fibers suggesting that the increased rate of amyloid formation by the mutant does not result from the relief of steric incompatibility in the fiber state transmission electronic microscopy circular dichroism and seeding studies were used to probe the structure of the resulting fibers the s g iapp peptide is toxic to cultured rat ins  transformed rat insulinoma    cells the sensitivity of amyloid formation to the identity of residue  was exploited to design a variant that is much slower to aggregate and that inhibits amyloid formation by wild type iapp an s k mutant forms amyloid with an  fold longer lag phase in homogeneous solution thioflavin t binding assays together with experiments using a p cyanophenylalanine p cyanophe variant of human iapp show that the designed s k mutant inhibits amyloid formation by human iapp the experiments illustrate how p cyanophe can be exploited to monitor amyloid formation even in the presence of other amyloidogenic proteins
