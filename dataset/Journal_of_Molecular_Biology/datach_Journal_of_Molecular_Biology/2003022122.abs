cis acting regulatory elements in the potato virus x   non translated region differentially affect minus strand and plus strand rna accumulation
the  nt   non translated region ntr of potato virus x pvx rna is identical in all sequenced pvx strains and contains sequences that are conserved among all potexviruses computer folding of the   ntr sequence predicted three stem loop structures sl  sl  and sl in the   to   direction  which generally were supported by solution structure analyses the importance of these sequence and or structural elements to pvx rna accumulation was further analyzed by inoculation of nicotiana tabacum nt  protoplasts with pvx transcripts containing mutations in the   ntr analyses of rna accumulation by s nuclease protection indicated that multiple sequence elements throughout the   ntr were important for minus strand rna accumulation formation of sl was required for accumulation of minus strand rna whereas sl and sl formation were less important however sequences within all of these predicted structures were required for minus strand rna accumulation including a conserved hexanucleotide sequence element in the loop of sl  and the cu nucleotide in a u rich sequence within sl  in contrast   nucleotides that were predicted to reside in sl could be deleted without any significant reduction in minus or plus strand rna levels potential polyadenylation signals near upstream elements nues in the   ntr of pvx rna were more important for plus strand rna accumulation than for minus strand rna accumulation in addition one of these nues overlapped with other sequence required for optimal minus strand rna levels these data indicate that the pvx   ntr contains multiple overlapping elements that influence accumulation of both minus and plus strand rna
