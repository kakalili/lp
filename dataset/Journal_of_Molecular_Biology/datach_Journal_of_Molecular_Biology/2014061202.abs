co crystallization with conformation specific designed ankyrin repeat proteins explains the conformational flexibility of bcl w
bcl w is a member of the bcl  family of anti apoptotic proteins a key event in the regulation of apoptosis is the heterodimerization between anti apoptotic and pro apoptotic family members which involves a conserved surface exposed groove on the anti apoptotic proteins crystal structures of the ligand binding competent conformation exist for all anti apoptotic family members with the exception of bcl w due to the flexibility of the bcl w groove region existing structures had suggested major deviations of the bcl w groove region from the otherwise structurally highly related remaining anti apoptotic family members to capture its ligand binding competent conformation by counteracting the conformational flexibility of the bcl w groove we had selected high affinity groove binding designed ankyrin repeat proteins darpins using ribosome display we now determined two high resolution crystal structures of human bcl w in complex with different darpins at resolutions   and     in which the structure of bcl w is virtually identical and bcl w adopts a conformation extremely similar to the ligand free conformation of its closest relative bcl xl in both structures however distinct differences to all previous bcl w structures are evident notably in the ligand binding region we provide the first structural explanation for the conformational flexibility of the bcl w groove region in comparison to other bcl  family members due to the importance of the anti apoptotic bcl  family as drug targets the presented crystal structure of ligand binding competent bcl w may serve as a valuable basis for structure based drug design in the future and provides a missing piece for the structural characterization of this protein family
