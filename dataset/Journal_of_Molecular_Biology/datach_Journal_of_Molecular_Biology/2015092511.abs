dna segment facilitated dissociation of fis and nhp a from dna detected via single molecule mechanical response
the rate of dissociation of a dna  protein complex is often considered to be a property of that complex without dependence on other nearby molecules in solution we study the kinetics of dissociation of the abundant escherichia coli nucleoid protein fis from dna using a single molecule mechanics assay the rate of fis dissociation from dna is strongly dependent on the solution concentration of dna the off rate koff of fis from dna shows an initially linear dependence on solution dna concentration characterized by an exchange rate of kex       ng  l   s   for  mm univalent salt buffer with a very small off rate at zero dna concentration the off rate saturates at approximately koff max      s   for dna concentrations above   ng  l this exchange reaction depends mainly on dna concentration with little dependence on the length of the dna molecules in solution or on binding affinity but this does increase with increasing salt concentration we also show data for the yeast hmgb protein nhp a showing a similar dna concentration dependent dissociation effect with faster rates suggesting generally weaker dna binding by nhp a relative to fis our results are well described by a model with an intermediate partially dissociated state where the protein is susceptible to being captured by a second dna segment in the manner of  direct transfer  reactions studied for other dna binding proteins this type of dissociation pathway may be important to protein  dna binding kinetics in vivo where dna concentrations are large
