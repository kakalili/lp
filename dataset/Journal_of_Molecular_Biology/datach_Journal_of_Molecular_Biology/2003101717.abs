binders based on dimerised immunoglobulin vh domains
antibody binding to antigen is mediated by the surface formed by the association of the two variable v regions of the l vl and h vh chains the capacity of vl to dimerise and the high structural similarity of vl and vh domains suggested the possibility that vh could also associate we show here that spontaneous formation of vh dimers vhd is in many cases permissive producing stable molecules with antigen binding specificity vhd were displayed on filamentous phages for the selection of antigen specific binders vhd were expressed and secreted efficiently from both bacteria and mammalian cells in different formats including single chain vh  linker vh   double chain  vh  and igg analogues having the vl replaced by vh the affinity kd app achieved with a vh dimer expressed in the igg format specific for a glutenin subunit was around  nm measured by two different methods which was about  times higher than that corresponding to the vl vh counterpart
