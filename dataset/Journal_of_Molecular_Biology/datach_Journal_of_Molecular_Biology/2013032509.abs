structural and biochemical characterization of the interaction between lgn and frmpd
the tetratricopeptide repeat tpr motif containing protein lgn binds multiple targets and regulates their subcellular localizations and functions during both asymmetric and symmetric cell divisions here we characterized the interaction between lgn tpr motifs and ferm and pdz domain containing  frmpd  and reported the crystal structure of the complex at    resolution a highly conserved fragment at the center of frmpd of   residues was found to be necessary and sufficient to bind to lgn tpr this frmpd fragment forms an extended structure and runs along the concave channel of the tpr superhelix in an antiparallel manner in the complex structural comparisons and biochemical studies of lgn frmpd and other known lgn target interactions demonstrate that the lgn tpr motifs are versatile and capable of recognizing multiple targets via diverse binding modes nevertheless a conserved  e qxex  e d qx  k r  motif in lgn pins partner of inscuteable tpr binding proteins has been identified
