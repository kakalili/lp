sequence and structural determinants of strand swapping in cadherin domains do all cadherins bind through the same adhesive interface
cadherins are cell surface adhesion proteins important for tissue development and integrity type i and type ii or classical cadherins form adhesive dimers via an interface formed through the exchange or  swapping   of the n terminal  strands from their membrane distal ec domains here we ask which sequence and structural features in ec domains are responsible for  strand swapping and whether members of other cadherin families form similar strand swapped binding interfaces we created a comprehensive database of multiple alignments of each type of cadherin domain we used the known three dimensional structures of classical cadherins to identify conserved positions in multiple sequence alignments that appear to be crucial determinants of the cadherin domain structure we identified features that are unique to ec domains on the basis of our analysis we conclude that all cadherin domains have very similar overall folds but with the exception of classical and desmosomal cadherin ec domains most of them do not appear to bind through a strand swapping mechanism thus non classical cadherins that function in adhesion are likely to use different protein  protein interaction interfaces our results have implications for the evolution of molecular mechanisms of cadherin mediated adhesion in vertebrates
