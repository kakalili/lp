in vitro selection for enzymatic activity a model study using adenylate cyclase
an in vitro enzyme selection that can in principle be generalised to most chemical reactions is described it makes use of filamentous phage display and of a tailor made antibody fragment directed against the reaction product the conversion of atp into      cyclic amp catalysed by bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase is taken as an example
