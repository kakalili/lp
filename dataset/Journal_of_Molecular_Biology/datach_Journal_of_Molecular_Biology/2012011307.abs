crystallographic evidence for a domain motion in rat nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase ntpdase
nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases ntpdases are a physiologically important class of membrane bound ectonucleotidases responsible for the regulation of extracellular levels of nucleotides cd  or ntpdase is the dominant ntpdase of the vasculature by hydrolyzing proinflammatory atp and platelet activating adp to amp it blocks platelet aggregation and supports blood flow thus great interest exists in understanding the structure and dynamics of this prototype member of the eukaryotic ntpdase family here we report the crystal structure of a variant of soluble ntpdase lacking a putative membrane interaction loop identified between the two lobes of the catalytic domain atpase and adpase activities of this variant are determined via a newly established kinetic isothermal titration calorimetry assay and compared to that of the soluble ntpdase variant characterized previously complex structures with decavanadate and heptamolybdate show that both polyoxometallates bind electrostatically to a loop that is involved in binding of the nucleobase in addition a comparison of the domain orientations of the four independent proteins in the crystal asymmetric unit provides the first direct experimental evidence for a domain motion of ntpdases an interdomain rotation angle of up to    affects the active site cleft between the two lobes of the protein comparison with a previously solved bacterial ntpdase structure indicates that the domains may undergo relative rotational movements of more than    our data support the idea that the influence of transmembrane helix dynamics on activity is achieved by coupling to a domain motion
