a comparative analysis of  structures of the amyloidogenic protein transthyretin edited by f cohen
self assembly of the human plasma protein transthyretin ttr into unbranched insoluble amyloid fibrils occurs as a result of point mutations that destabilize the molecule leading to conformational changes the tertiary structure of native soluble ttr and many of its disease causing mutants have been determined several independent studies by x ray crystallography have suggested structural differences between ttr variants which are claimed to be of significance for amyloid formation as these changes are minor and not consistent between the studies we have compared all ttr structures available at the protein data bank including three wild types three non amyloidogenic mutants seven amyloidogenic mutants and nine complexes the reference for this study is a new    resolution structure of human wild type ttr refined to an r factor r free of        the present findings are discussed in the light of the previous structural studies of ttr variants and show the reported structural differences to be non significant
