a repeated coiled coil interruption in the escherichiacoli condensin mukb
mukb a divergent structural maintenance of chromosomes smc protein is important for chromosome segregation and condensation in escherichia coli and other  proteobacteria mukb and canonical smc proteins share a common five domain structure in which globular n and c terminal regions combine to form an atp binding cassette like atpase domain this atpase domain is connected to a central globular dimerization domain by a long antiparallel coiled coil the structures of both globular domains have been solved recently in contrast little is known about the coiled coil in spite of its clear importance for smc function recently we identified interacting regions on the n and c terminal halves of the mukb coiled coil through photoaffinity cross linking experiments on the basis of these low resolution experimental constraints phylogenetic data and coiled coil prediction analysis we proposed a preliminary model in which the mukb coiled coil is divided into multiple segments here we use a disulfide cross linking assay to detect paired residues on opposite strands of mukb s coiled coil this method provides accurate register data and demonstrates the presence of at least five coiled coil segments in this domain moreover these studies show that the segments are interrupted by a repeated unprecedented deviation from canonical coiled coil structure these experiments provide a sufficiently detailed view of the mukb coiled coil to allow rational manipulation of this region for the first time opening the door for structure  function studies of this domain
