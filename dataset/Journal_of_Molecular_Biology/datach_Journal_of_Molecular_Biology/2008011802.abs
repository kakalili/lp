malarial eba   region vi crystallographic structure reveals a kix like binding interface
the malaria parasite proliferates in the bloodstream of its vertebrate host by invading and replicating within erythrocytes to achieve successful invasion a number of discrete and essential events need to take place at the parasite  host cell interface erythrocyte binding antigen   eba   is a member of a family of plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte binding proteins involved in the formation of a tight junction a necessary step in invasion here we present the crystal structure of eba   region vi rvi  a cysteine rich domain that is highly conserved within the protein family and is essential for eba   trafficking the structure was solved by selenomethionine single wavelength anomalous dispersion at     resolution it reveals a homodimer containing in each subunit a compact five  helix core that is stabilized by four conserved disulfide bridges rvi adopts a novel fold that is likely conserved across the protein family indicating a conserved function it shows no similarity to the duffy binding like domains of eba   involved in erythrocyte binding indicating a distinct role remarkably rvi possesses structural features related to the kix binding domain of the coactivator creb binding protein supporting the binding and trafficking roles that have been ascribed to it and providing a rational basis for further experimental investigation of its function
