crystal structure and mutational study of a unique spou family archaeal methylase that forms   o methylcytidine at position  of trna
the conserved cytidine residue at position  of trna contributes to the maintenance of the l shaped tertiary structure atrm  catalyzes the   o methylation of the cytidine residue in archaeal trna using s adenosyl l methionine based on the amino acid sequence atrm  is the most distant member of the spou family here we determined the crystal structure of pyrococcus horikoshii atrm  complexed with s adenosyl l methionine at     resolution atrm  consists of the spout domain which contains the characteristic deep trefoil knot and a unique c terminal  hairpin atrm  forms a dimer the s adenosyl l methionine binding and dimerization of atrm  were similar to those of the other spou members a structure based sequence alignment revealed that atrm  conserves only motif ii among the four signature motifs however an essential arg  residue is located at a novel position within motif i biochemical assays showed that atrm  prefers the l shaped trna to the  form as its substrate
