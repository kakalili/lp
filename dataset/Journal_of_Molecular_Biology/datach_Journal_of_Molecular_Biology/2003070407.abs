recombinogenic flap ligation mediated by human topoisomerase i
aberration of eukaryotic topoisomerase i catalysis leads to potentially recombinogenic pathways by allowing the joining of heterologous dna strands recently a new ligation pathway flap ligation was presented for vaccinia virus topoisomerase i in which blunt end cleavage complexes ligate the recessed end of duplex acceptors having a single stranded   tail this reaction was suggested to play an important role in the repair of topoisomerase i induced dna double strand breaks here we characterize flap ligation mediated by human topoisomerase i we demonstrate that cleavage complexes containing the enzyme at a blunt end allow invasion of a   acceptor tail matching the scissile strand of the donor which facilitates ligation of the recessed   hydroxyl end however the reaction was strictly dependent on the length of double stranded dna of the donor complexes and longer stretches of base pairing inhibited strand invasion the stabilization of the dna helix was most probably provided by the covalently bound enzyme itself since deleting the n terminal domain of human topoisomerase i stimulated flap ligation we suggest that stabilization of the dna duplex upon enzyme binding may play an important role during normal topoisomerase i catalysis by preventing undesired strand transfer reactions for flap ligation to function in a repair pathway factors other than topoisomerase i such as helicases would be necessary to unwind the dna duplex and allow strand invasion
