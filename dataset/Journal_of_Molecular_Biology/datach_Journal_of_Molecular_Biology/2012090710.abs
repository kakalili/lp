identifying antigenicity associated sites in highly pathogenic h n influenza virus hemagglutinin by using sparse learning
since the isolation of a goose guangdong     h n  in farmed geese in southern china highly pathogenic h n avian influenza viruses have posed a continuous threat to both public and animal health the non synonymous mutation of the h hemagglutinin ha gene has resulted in antigenic drift leading to difficulties in both clinical diagnosis and vaccine strain selection characterizing h n s antigenic profiles would help resolve these problems in this study a novel sparse learning method was developed to identify antigenicity associated sites in influenza a viruses on the basis of immunologic data sets i e  from hemagglutination inhibition and microneutralization assays and ha protein sequences twenty one potential antigenicity associated sites were identified a total of  h n mutants were used to validate the effects of  of these predicted sites on h n s antigenicity including  newly identified sites not located in reported antibody binding sites the experimental data confirmed that mutations of these tested sites lead to changes in viral antigenicity validating our method
