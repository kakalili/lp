structure and properties of a dimeric n terminal fragment of human ubiquitin edited by r huber
previous peptide dissection and kinetic experiments have indicated that in vitro folding of ubiquitin may proceed via transient species in which native like structure has been acquired in the first  residues a peptide fragment uq    encompassing residues  to  of ubiquitin was produced in order to test whether this portion has propensity for independent self assembly surprisingly the construct formed a folded symmetrical dimer that was stabilised by   m sodium sulphate at   k the s state  the solution structure of the uq    dimer was determined by multinuclear nmr spectroscopy each subunit of uq    consists of an n terminal  hairpin followed by an  helix and a final  strand with orientations similar to intact ubiquitin the dimer is formed by the third  strand of one subunit interleaving between the hairpin and third strand of the other to give a six stranded  sheet with the two  helices sitting on top the helix helix and strand portions of the dimer interface also mimic related features in the structure of ubiquitin the structural specificity of the uq    peptide is tuneable as the concentration of sodium sulphate is decreased near native alternative conformations are populated in slow chemical exchange magnetization transfer experiments were performed to characterize the various species present in   m sodium sulphate namely the s state and two minor forms chemical shift differences suggest that one minor form is very similar to the s state while the other experiences a significant conformational change in the third strand a segmental rearrangement of the third strand in one subunit of the s state would render the dimer asymmetric accounting for most of our results similar small scale transitions in proteins are often invoked to explain solvent exchange at backbone amide proton sites that have an intermediate level of protection
