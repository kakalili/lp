We describe a low-cost high-throughput technique to characterize nuclear protein DNA-binding interactions. This technique, known as Multiplexed Competitor Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay, uses a series of multiplexed oligonucleotide DNA consensus competitors, in combination with a standard electrophoretic mobility shift assay procedure, to efficiently characterize DNA-binding proteins. We show utility for the method to identify a previously unreported hepatocyte nuclear factor-3 site created in intron 8 of the lipoprotein lipase gene by a common single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs327).
