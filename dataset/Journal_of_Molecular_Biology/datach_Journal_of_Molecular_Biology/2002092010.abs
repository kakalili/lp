oligomerization of a peptide derived from the transmembrane region of the sodium pump  subunit effect of the pathological mutation g r
the na k atpase or sodium pump is a ubiquitously expressed membrane bound enzyme that controls the transmembrane tm gradients of sodium and potassium ions in animal cells the enzyme comprises two subunits   and   and in the kidney is also associated with a small single spanning membrane protein the  subunit this  amino acid residues protein has been linked to a form of dominant renal hypomagnesaemia resulting from substitution of a highly conserved glycine residue gly  to arginine residue in order to characterize the quaternary structure of the  subunit and effects of the g r mutation thereupon we synthesized a series of peptides wild type and mutant that span the  subunit tm region using circular dichroism spectroscopy we show that the  amino acid residue peptides are random coils in aqueous buffer but spontaneously adopt an  helical conformation in the presence of detergent micelles sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and perfluorooctanoate pfo  furthermore fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments combined with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrate that while  tm does not self associate in sds it forms oligomers in pfo a detergent that tolerates relatively weak associations between membrane proteins importantly oligomerization of  tm is abrogated in a peptide that contains either the disease causing mutation g r or the more conservative mutation g l on the other hand a peptide that contains a gly to arg substitution on a different face of the helix at position   retains its ability to oligomerize our results provide evidence for a link between renal hypomagnesaemia and  subunit oligomerization
