hidden allostery in human glutathione transferase p  unveiled by unnatural amino acid substitutions and inhibition studies
conventional steady state kinetic studies of the dimeric human glutathione transferase gst p  do not reveal obvious deviations from michaelis  menten behavior by contrast engineering of the key residue y  of the lock and key motif in the subunit interface reveals allosteric properties of the enzyme the low activity mutant y c characterized by   fold decreased kcat and   fold increased kmgsh values displays an apparent hill coefficient of       chemical alkylation of the sulfhydryl group of y c by unnatural n butyl or n pentyl substitutions enhances the catalytic efficiency kcat kmgsh to near the wild type value but still yields hill coefficients of      and      respectively thus allosteric kinetic behavior is not dependent on low activity of the enzyme on the other hand s cyclobutylmethyl substituted y c which also displays high catalytic efficiency has a hill coefficient of       showing that subtle differences in structure at the subunit interface influence the complex kinetic behavior furthermore inhibition studies of native gst p  using ethacrynic acid demonstrate that a ligand bound noncovalently to the wild type enzyme also can elicit allosteric kinetic behavior thus we conclude that the gst p  structure has intrinsic allostery that becomes overt under some but not all ambient conditions
