Viruses and bacteriophages recognize cell surface proteins using receptor-binding proteins. In most tailed bacteriophages, receptor-binding proteins are located on the bacteriophage tail. The gene transfer agent of Rhodobacter capsulatus, RcGTA, morphologically resembles a tailed bacteriophage and binds to a capsular polysaccharide covering R. capsulatus cells. Here, we report that the RcGTA capsid (head) is decorated by spikes that are needed for binding to the capsule. The triangular spikes measured ~12nm and appeared to be attached at the capsid vertices. Head spike production required the putative carbohydrate-binding protein ghsB (rcc01080) previously thought to encode a side tail fiber protein. We found that ghsB is likely co-transcribed with ghsA (rcc01079) and that ghsA/ghsB is regulated by the CckA-ChpT-CtrA phosphorelay homologues and a quorum-sensing system. GhsA and GhsB were found to be CckA-dependent RcGTA maturation factors, as GhsA- and GhsB-deficient particles were found to have altered native-gel electrophoresis migration. Additionally, we provide electron microscopy images showing that RcGTA contains side tail fibers and a baseplate-like structure near the tip of the tail, which are independent of ghsB.
