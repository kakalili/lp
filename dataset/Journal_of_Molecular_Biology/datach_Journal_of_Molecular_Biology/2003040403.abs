nmr structure of citrobacter freundii ampd comparison with bacteriophage t lysozyme and homology with pgrp domains
ampd is a bacterial amidase involved in the recycling of cell wall fragments in gram negative bacteria inactivation of ampd leads to derepression of  lactamase expression presenting a major pathway for the acquisition of constitutive antibiotic resistance here we report the nmr structure of ampd from citrobacter freundii pdb accession code j g  a deep substrate binding pocket explains the observed specificity for low molecular mass substrates the fold is related to that of bacteriophage t lysozyme both proteins bind zinc at a conserved site and require zinc for amidase activity although the enzymatic mechanism seems to differ in detail the structure based sequence alignment identifies conserved features that are also conserved in the eukaryotic peptidoglycan recognition protein pgrp domains including the zinc coordination site in several of them pgrp domains thus belong to the same fold family and where zinc binding residues are conserved may have amidase activity this hypothesis is supported by the observation that human serum n acetylmuramyl l alanine amidase seems to be identical with a soluble form of human pgrp l
