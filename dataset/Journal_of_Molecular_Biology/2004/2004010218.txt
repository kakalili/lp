Adam33 is a putative asthma susceptibility gene encoding for a membrane-anchored metalloprotease belonging to the ADAM family. The ADAMs (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) are a family of glycoproteins implicated in cell-cell interactions, cell fusion, and cell signaling. We have determined the crystal structure of the Adam33 catalytic domain in complex with the inhibitor marimastat and the inhibitor-free form. The structures reveal the polypeptide fold and active site environment resembling that of other metalloproteases. The substrate-binding site contains unique features that allow the structure-based design of specific inhibitors of this enzyme.
