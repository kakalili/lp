atomic      resolution structure of an inverting glycosidase in complex with substrate edited by r huber
the crystal structure of clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase cela in complex with cellopentaose has been determined at     resolution the oligosaccharide occupies six d glucosyl binding subsites three on either side of the scissile glycosidic linkage the substrate and product of the reaction occupy different positions at the reducing end of the cleft where an extended array of hydrogen bonding interactions with water molecules fosters the departure of the leaving group severe torsional strain upon the bound substrate forces a distorted boat  b conformation for the glucosyl residue bound at subsite    which facilitates the formation of an oxocarbenium ion intermediate and might favor the breakage of the sugar ring concomitant with catalysis
