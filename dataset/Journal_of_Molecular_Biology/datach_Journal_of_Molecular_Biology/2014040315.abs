alanine scan of core positions in ubiquitin reveals links between dynamics stability and function
mutations at solvent inaccessible core positions in proteins can impact function through many biophysical mechanisms including alterations to thermodynamic stability and protein dynamics as these properties of proteins are difficult to investigate the impacts of core mutations on protein function are poorly understood for most systems here we determined the effects of alanine mutations at all  core positions in ubiquitin on function in yeast the majority   of   of alanine substitutions supported yeast growth as the sole ubiquitin both the two null mutants i a and l a were less stable to temperature induced unfolding in vitro than wild type wt but were well folded at physiological temperatures heteronuclear nmr studies indicated that the l a mutation reduces temperature stability while retaining a ground state structure similar to wt this structure enables l a to bind to common ubiquitin receptors in vitro many of the core alanine ubiquitin mutants including one of the null variants i a  exhibited an increased accumulation of high molecular weight species suggesting that these mutants caused a defect in the processing of ubiquitin substrate conjugates in contrast l a exhibited a unique accumulation pattern with reduced levels of high molecular weight species and undetectable levels of free ubiquitin when conjugation to other proteins was blocked l a ubiquitin accumulated as free ubiquitin in yeast based on these findings we speculate that ubiquitin s stability to unfolding may be required for efficient recycling during proteasome mediated substrate degradation
