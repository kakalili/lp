the subunit  of the cop signalosome suppresses gene expression through its n terminal domain and incorporates into the complex through the pci domain edited by s reed
the cop signalosome is a conserved protein complex composed of eight subunits individual subunits of the complex have been linked to various signal transduction pathways leading to gene expression and cell cycle control however it is not understood how each subunit executes these activities as part of a large protein complex in this study we dissected structure and function of the subunit  csn or gps  of the cop signalosome relative to the complex we demonstrated that the c terminal half of csn encompassing the pci domain is responsible for interaction with csn  csn  and csn subunits and is required for incorporation of the subunit into the complex the n terminal fragment of csn cannot stably associate with the complex but can translocate to the nucleus on its own we further show that csn or the n terminal fragment of csn  csn n can inhibit c fos expression from either a transfected template or a chromosomal transgene fos lacz  moreover csn as well as csn n can potently suppress signal activation of a ap  promoter and moderately suppress serum activation of a sre promoter but is unable to inhibit pka induced cre promoter activity we conclude that the n terminal half of csn harbors the activity domain that confers most of the repression functions of csn while the c terminal half allows integration of the protein into the cop signalosome
