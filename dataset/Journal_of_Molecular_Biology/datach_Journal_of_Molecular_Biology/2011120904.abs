barriers and silencers a theoretical toolkit for control and containment of nucleosome based epigenetic states
positive feedback in nucleosome modification has been proposed to allow large chromatin regions to exist stably and heritably in distinct expression states however modeling has shown that such epigenetic bistability requires that modifying enzymes recruited by nucleosomes are active on distant nucleosomes potentially allowing uncontrollable spreading of modification by modeling the silencing of mating type loci in saccharomyces cerevisiae we show that a modification reaction that combines a long range component and a locally acting component can provide bistability and can be blocked by simple barriers that interrupt the nucleosome chain we find that robust containment of the silenced region could be achieved by the presence of a number of weak simple barriers in the surrounding chromatin and a limited capacity of the positive feedback reaction in addition we show that the state of the silenced region can be regulated by silencer elements acting only on neighboring nucleosomes thus a relatively simple set of nucleosome modifying enzymes and recognition domains is all that is needed to make chromatin based epigenetics useful and safe
