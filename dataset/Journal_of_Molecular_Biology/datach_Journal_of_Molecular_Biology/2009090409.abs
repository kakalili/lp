in a head on collision two rna polymerases approaching one another on the same dna may pass by one another
using a template that contains promoters for t and t rna polymerases rnaps in opposing orientations and his tagged derivatives of these rnaps that allow immobilization on solid matrices we have determined that a t elongation complex ec may be advanced past a halted t ec and that after the collision the halted t ec may resume transcription since rnaps moving in opposite directions use two different strands of the dna as their templates it seems likely that they manage to pass by one other by temporarily releasing their nontemplate strand while maintaining association with their template strand
