proteorhodopsin is a light driven proton pump with variable vectoriality
proteorhodopsin a homologue of archaeal bacteriorhodopsin br  belongs to a newly identified family of retinal proteins from marine bacteria which could play an important role in the energy balance of the biosphere we cloned the cdna sequence of proteorhodopsin by chemical gene synthesis expressed the protein in escherichia coli cells purified and reconstituted the protein in its functional active state the photocycle characteristics were determined by time resolved absorption and fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy the ph dependence of the absorption spectrum indicates that the pka of the primary acceptor of the schiff base proton asp  is    generally the photocycle of proteorhodopsin is similar to that of br although an l like photocycle intermediate was not detectable whereas at ph gt  an m like intermediate is formed upon illumination at ph  no m like intermediate could be detected as the photocycle kinetics do not change between the acidic and alkaline state of proteorhodopsin the only difference between these two forms is the protonation status of asp  this is corroborated by time resolved ft ir spectroscopy which demonstrates that proton transfer from the retinal schiff base to asp  is observed at alkaline ph but the other vibrational changes are essentially ph independent after reconstitution into proteoliposomes light induced proton currents of proteorhodopsin were measured in a compound membrane system where proteoliposomes were adsorbed to planar lipid bilayers our results show that proteorhodopsin is a light driven proton pump with characteristics similar to those of br at alkaline ph however at acidic ph the direction of proton pumping is inverted complementary experiments were carried out on proteorhodopsin expressed heterologously in xenopus laevis oocytes under voltage clamp conditions the following results were obtained   at alkaline ph proteorhodopsin mediates outwardly directed proton pumping like br   the direction of proton pumping can be inverted when asp  is protonated   the current can be inverted by changes of the polarity of the applied voltage   the light intensity dependence of the photocurrents leads to the conclusion that the alkaline form of proteorhodopsin shows efficient proton pumping after sequential excitation by two photons
