structural rearrangements in the active site of the thermus thermophilus  s rrna methyltransferase ksga in a binary complex with   methylthioadenosine
posttranscriptional modification of ribosomal rna rrna occurs in all kingdoms of life the s adenosyl l methionine dependent methyltransferase ksga introduces the most highly conserved rrna modification the dimethylation of a   and a   of  s rrna loss of this dimethylation confers resistance to the antibiotic kasugamycin here we report biochemical studies and high resolution crystal structures of ksga from thermus thermophilus methylation of  s ribosomal subunits by t thermophilus ksga is more efficient at low concentrations of magnesium ions suggesting that partially unfolded rna is the preferred substrate the overall structure is similar to that of other methyltransferases but contains an additional  helix in a novel n terminal extension comparison of the apoenzyme with complex structures with   methylthioadenosine or adenosine bound in the cofactor binding site reveals novel features when compared with related enzymes several mobile loop regions that restrict access to the cofactor binding site are observed in addition the orientation of residues in the substrate binding site indicates that conformational changes are required for binding two adjacent residues of the substrate rrna
