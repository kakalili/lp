nmr structure of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases  implicates localized induced fit in recognition of matrix metalloproteinases edited by p e wright
a high quality solution structure of the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitory n terminal domain of recombinant human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases  n timp  has been determined for the rigidly packed residues the average rmsd to the mean structure is     for the backbone atoms and     for all heavy atoms comparison of the solution structure of free n timp  with the crystal structure of timp  bound to the catalytic domain of mmp  gomis r th et al     shows that the structural core of the  barrel flanked by helices is nearly unchanged by the association with mmp  evident from a backbone rmsd of     however clear differences in the conformation of the mmp binding ridge of free and mmp bound timp  suggest induced fit throughout the ridge the mmp dependent conformational changes in the ridge include a dramatic bending of ab loop residues glu  through leu  moderate hinge bending of the cd loop about residues ala  and cys  and modest bending of the cys through pro segment a large number of interresidue nuclear overhauser enhancements noes augmented by stereospecific assignments torsion restraints and dipolar couplings an average of  non trivial restraints per residue engender confidence in these structural inferences a tight cluster of three lysine residues and one arginine residue atop  strands a and b and identical among timp sequences form the heart of a highly conserved electropositive patch that may interact with anionic components of the extracellular matrix
