structural basis for molecular recognition in an affibody affibody complex
affibody molecules constitute a class of engineered binding proteins based on the  residue three helix bundle z domain derived from staphylococcal protein a spa  affibody proteins are selected as binders to target proteins by phage display of combinatorial libraries in which typically  side chains on the surface of helices  and  in the z domain have been randomized the ztaq anti ztaq affibody  affibody complex consisting of ztaq originally selected as a binder to taq dna polymerase and anti ztaq selected as binder to ztaq is formed with a dissociation constant kd    nm we have determined high precision solution structures of free ztaq and anti ztaq and the ztaq anti ztaq complex under identical experimental conditions    c in   mm nacl with   mm potassium phosphate buffer at ph    the complex is formed with helices  and  of anti ztaq in perpendicular contact with helices  and  of ztaq the interaction surface is large        and unusually non polar    compared to other protein  protein complexes it involves all varied residues on anti ztaq most corresponding taq dna polymerase binding side chains on ztaq and several additional side chain and backbone contacts other notable features include a substantial rearrangement induced fit of aromatic side chains in ztaq upon binding a close contact between glycine residues in the two subunits that might involve aliphatic glycine h  to backbone carbonyl hydrogen bonds and four hydrogen bonds made by the two guanidinium n h groups of an arginine side chain comparisons of the present structure with other data for affibody proteins and the z domain suggest that intrinsic binding properties of the originating spa surface might be inherited by the affibody binders a thermodynamic characterization of ztaq and anti ztaq is presented in an accompanying paper
