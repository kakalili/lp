chaperone interacting tpr proteins in caenorhabditis elegans
the atp hydrolyzing molecular chaperones hsc  hsp  and hsp  bind a diverse set of tetratricopeptide repeat tpr containing cofactors via their c terminal peptide motifs ieevd and meevd these cochaperones contribute to substrate turnover and confer specific activities to the chaperones higher eukaryotic genomes encode a large number of tpr domain containing proteins the human proteome contains more than   tpr proteins and that of caenorhabditis elegans about   it is unknown how many of them interact with hsc  or hsp  we systematically screened the c elegans proteome for tpr domain containing proteins that likely interact with hsc  and hsp  and ranked them due to their similarity with known chaperone interacting tprs we find c elegans to encode many tpr proteins which are not present in yeast all of these have homologs in fruit fly or humans highly ranking uncharacterized open reading frames c h   c b  and zk   may encode weakly conserved homologs of the human proteins rpap  ttc and tom  c b  and zk   bind both hsc  and hsp  with low micromolar affinities mutation of amino acids involved in eevd binding disrupts the interaction in vivo zk   is localized to mitochondria in tissues with known chaperone requirements while c b  colocalizes with hsc  in intestinal cells the highest ranking open reading frame with non conserved eevd interacting residues f h   did not show any binding to hsc  or hsp  suggesting that only about  of the tpr domain containing proteins in c elegans interact with chaperones while the many others may have evolved to bind other ligands
