mammalian cells express two vps proteins both of which are involved in intracellular protein trafficking
the yeast vps protein vps p is a member of the aaa protein family atpases associated with diverse cellular activities and a key player in the transport of proteins out of a prevacuolar endosomal compartment in human cells we identified two non allelic orthologous proteins vps a and vps b of yeast vps p the human vps a and vps b proteins display a high degree of sequence identity to each other    and to the yeast vps protein   and   respectively  yeast cells lacking a functional vps gene exhibit a temperature sensitive growth defect and mislocalise a carboxypeptidase y invertase fusion protein to the cell surface heterologous expression of human vps genes in vps mutant yeast strains led in the case of human vps a to a partial and in the case of human vps b to a complete suppression of the temperature sensitive growth defect the vacuolar protein sorting defect of vps mutant yeast cells was complemented completely by heterologous expressed human vps b protein and partially by the human vps a protein expression of mutant human vps a e  q and vps b e  q proteins harbouring single amino acid exchanges in their aaa domains induced dominant negative vacuolar protein sorting defects in wild type yeast cells in both cases two hybrid experiments suggest that the human vps a and vps b proteins can form heteromeric complexes and subcellular localisation experiments indicate that both human vps proteins associate with endosomal compartments in yeast based on these results we conclude that both human vps proteins are involved in intracellular protein trafficking presumably at a late endosomal protein transport step similar to the vps p in yeast
