oligomeric structure of  calmodulin dependent protein kinase ii edited by a r fersht
the subunit stoichiometry and symmetry of the neuronal  calmodulin dependent protein kinase ii  camkii is investigated in this report to understand the structural basis of its regulation and mechanism at the molecular level two preparations are studied  camkii obtained by overexpression in baculovirus transfected insect cells and camkii isolated from rat forebrain the structures are studied by electron microscopy and image analysis single particle analysis of individual molecular images reveals a molecule with a circular outline and pronounced  fold rotational symmetry of the central part the central part has an outer radius of   nm and is composed of six lobes grouped around a hollow centre the outer ring extends to    nm and consists of  apparent domains these data are interpreted in terms of a three dimensional model of the  camkii complex consisting of  subunits each corresponding to a single  camkii polypeptide chain the inner ring corresponding to approximately one third of the molecular mass of the complex is made up of the c terminal association domains the  association domains are arranged in two concentric hexagonal rings at different axial levels and in rotational register the outer ring corresponding to the remaining molecular mass of the complex is made up of the  n terminal catalytic domains located at an axial level halfway between the two levels of the association domains the  fold symmetry of stacked association domains may derive from subunit arrangements corresponding to either the c or the d point group symmetries the symmetry and the resulting subunit arrangement define the pattern and extent of regulatory autophosphorylation within the  camkii complex
