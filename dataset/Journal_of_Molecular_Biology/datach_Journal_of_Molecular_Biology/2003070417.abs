towards an understanding of the poliovirus replication complex the solution structure of the soluble domain of the poliovirus a protein
poliovirus is a positive strand rna virus and the prototypical member of the picornaviridae family upon infection the viral rna genome is translated from a single open reading frame into a polypeptide which undergoes a series of cleavages to ultimately form four structural and seven non structural proteins a replication complex is then formed which replicates the viral genome into negative and positive strands for further translation replication and packaging into viral progeny poliovirus a protein  a is a critical component of the viral replication complex and is the putative target of enviroxime an antiviral drug shown to block viral replication  a also inhibits host cell endoplasmic reticulum to golgi apparatus transport a function which may play a key role in viral evasion from the host immune response  a an  residue protein consisting of a soluble n terminus and a hydrophobic c terminus is formed by the cleavage of the precursor protein ab into a and b vpg  although they differ by only  residues the precursor protein ab and its cleavage product a have distinct functions in viral replication we have determined the structure of the soluble n terminal domain of a  a n using nmr spectroscopy we show that a n exists as a symmetric dimer and each monomer consists of an  helical hairpin with unstructured yet functional n and c termini we also show that the a n structure contains a negatively charged surface patch and provides a context for interpreting the biochemical characteristics of a number of previously reported a and ab mutants
