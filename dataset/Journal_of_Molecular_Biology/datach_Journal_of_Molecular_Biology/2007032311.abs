dimer dissociation and unfolding mechanism of coagulation factor xi apple  domain spectroscopic and mutational analysis
the blood coagulation protein factor xi fxi consists of a pair of disulfide linked chains each containing four apple domains and a catalytic domain the apple  domain a  f   e   mediates non covalent homodimer formation even when the cysteine involved in an intersubunit disulfide is mutated to serine c  s  to understand the role of non covalent interactions stabilizing the fxi dimer equilibrium unfolding of wild type a and its c  s variant was monitored by circular dichroism intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence and dynamic light scattering measurements as a function of guanidine hydrochloride concentration global analysis of the unimolecular unfolding transition of wild type a revealed a partially unfolded equilibrium intermediate at low to moderate denaturant concentrations the optically detected equilibrium of c  s a also fits best to a three state model in which the native dimer unfolds via a monomeric intermediate state dimer dissociation is characterized by a dissociation constant kd of    nm in terms of monomer  which is in agreement with the dissociation constant measured independently using fluorescence anisotropy the results imply that fxi folding occurs via a monomeric equilibrium intermediate this observation sheds light on the effect of certain naturally occurring mutations such as f  l which lead to intracellular accumulation of non native forms of fxi to investigate the structural and energetic consequences of the f  l mutation which perturbs a cluster of aromatic side chains within the core of the a monomer it was introduced into the dissociable dimer c  s a  nmr chemical shift analysis confirmed that the mutant can assume a native like dimeric structure however equilibrium unfolding measurements show that the mutation causes a fourfold increase in the kd value for dissociation of the native dimer and a  kcal mol stabilization of the monomer resulting in a highly populated intermediate since the f  side chain does not directly participate in the dimer interface we propose that the f  l mutation leads to increased dimer dissociation by stabilizing a monomeric state with altered side chain packing that is unfavorable for homodimer formation
