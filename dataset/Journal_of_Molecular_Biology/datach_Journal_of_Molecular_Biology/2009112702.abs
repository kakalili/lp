residues gating the periplasmic pathway of lacy
x ray crystal structures of lacy lactose permease of escherichia coli exhibit a large cytoplasmic cavity containing the residues involved in sugar binding and h translocation at the apex and a tightly packed side facing the periplasm however biochemical and biophysical evidence provide a strong indication that a hydrophilic pathway opens on the external surface of lacy with closing of the cytoplasmic side upon sugar binding thus an alternating access mechanism in which sugar and h binding sites at the approximate middle of the molecule are alternatively exposed to either side of the membrane is likely to underlie lacy catalyzed sugar h symport to further investigate periplasmic opening we replaced paired residues on the tightly packed periplasmic side of lacy with cys and the effect of cross linking was studied by testing the accessibility reactivity of cys  with the elongated       impermeant hydrophilic reagent maleimide peg biotin when the paired cys mutant ile   cys asn   cys containing native cys  is oxidized to form a disulfide bond the reactivity of cys  is markedly inhibited moreover the reactivity of cys  in this mutant increases with the length of the cross linking agent in contrast maleimide peg biotin reactivity of cys  is unaffected by oxidation of two other paired cys mutants at the mouth of the periplasmic cavity the data indicate that residues ile  and asn  play a primary role in gating the periplasmic cavity and provide further support for the alternating access model
