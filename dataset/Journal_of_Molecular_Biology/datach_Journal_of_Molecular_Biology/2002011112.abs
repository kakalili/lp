a novel view of domain flexibility in e coli adenylate kinase based on structural mode coupling  n nmr relaxation  edited by p e wright
adenylate kinase from escherichia coli akeco  consisting of a single   kda polypeptide chain folded into domains core ampbd and lid catalyzes the reaction amp atp  adp in the ligand free enzyme the domains ampbd and lid execute large amplitude movements controlling substrate binding and product release during catalysis domain flexibility is investigated herein with the slowly relaxing local structure srls model for  n relaxation srls accounts rigorously for coupling between the global and local n h motions through a local ordering potential exerted by the protein structure at the n h bond the latter reorients with respect to its protein surroundings which reorient on the slower time scale associated with the global protein tumbling akeco diffuses globally with correlation time  m   ns while locally two different dynamic cases prevail the domain core features ordering about the equilibrium n h bond orientation with order parameters s  of     and local motional correlation times   mainly between    ps this represents a conventional rigid protein structure with rapid small amplitude n h fluctuations the domains ampbd and lid feature small parallel zm ordering of s     which can be reinterpreted as high perpendicular ym ordering m denotes the local ordering local diffusion frame local motion about zm is given by      ps and local motion of the effective zm axis about ym by      ns zm is tilted at approximately   from the n h bond the orientation of the ym axis may be considered parallel to the ci    ci  axis the    mode reflects collective nanosecond peptide plane motions interpretable as domain motion a powerful new model of protein flexibility domain motion has been established conformational exchange rex processes accompany the    mode the srls analysis is compared with the conventional model free analysis
