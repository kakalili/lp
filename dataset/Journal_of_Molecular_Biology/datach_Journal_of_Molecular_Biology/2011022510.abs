two endoplasmic reticulum pdi peroxidases increase the efficiency of the use of peroxide during disulfide bond formation
disulfide bond formation in the endoplasmic reticulum by the sulfhydryl oxidase ero family is thought to be accompanied by the concomitant formation of hydrogen peroxide since secretory cells can make substantial amounts of proteins that contain disulfide bonds the production of this reactive oxygen species could have potentially lethal consequences here we show that two human proteins gpx and gpx  labeled as secreted glutathione peroxidases are actually endoplasmic reticulum resident protein disulfide isomerase peroxidases in vitro the addition of gpx or gpx to a folding protein along with protein disulfide isomerase and peroxide enables the efficient oxidative refolding of a reduced denatured protein furthermore both gpx and gpx interact with ero  in vivo and gpx significantly increases oxygen consumption by ero  in vitro hence gpx and gpx may represent a novel route for the productive use of peroxide produced by ero  during disulfide bond formation
