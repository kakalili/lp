adaptive evolution of a tagged chimeric gammaretrovirus identification of novel cis acting elements that modulate splicing
retroviruses are well known for their ability to incorporate envelope env proteins from other retroviral strains and genera and even from other virus families this characteristic has been widely exploited for the generation of replication defective retroviral vectors including those derived from murine leukemia virus mlv  bearing heterologous env proteins we investigated the possibility of  genetically pseudotyping  replication competent mlv by replacing the native env gene in a full length viral genome with that of another gammaretrovirus earlier we developed replication competent versions of mlv that stably transmit and express transgenes inserted into the   untranslated region of the viral genome in one such tagged mlv expressing green fluorescent protein we replaced the native env sequence with that of gibbon ape leukemia virus galv  although the galv env protein is commonly used to make high titer pseudotypes of mlv vectors we found that the env replacement greatly attenuated viral replication however extended cultivation of cells exposed to the chimeric virus resulted in selection of mutants exhibiting rapid replication kinetics and different variants arose in different infections two of these variants had acquired mutations at or adjacent to the splice acceptor site and three others had acquired dual mutations within the long terminal repeat analysis of the levels of unspliced and spliced viral rna produced by the parental and adapted viruses showed that the mutations gained by each of these variants functioned to reverse an imbalance in splicing caused by the env gene substitution our results reveal the presence of previously unknown cis acting sequences in mlv that modulate splicing of the viral transcript and demonstrate that tagging of the retroviral genome with an easily assayed transgene can be combined with in vitro evolution as an approach to efficiently generating and screening for replicating mutants of replication impaired recombinant viruses
