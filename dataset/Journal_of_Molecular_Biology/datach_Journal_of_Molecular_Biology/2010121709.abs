the extended conformation of the    crystal structure of the three pasta domain of a ser thr kinase from the human pathogen staphylococcus aureus
pasta penicillin binding protein and serine threonine kinase associated modules are found in penicillin binding proteins and bacterial serine threonine kinases mainly from gram positive firmicutes and actinobacteria they may act as extracellular sensors by binding peptidoglycan fragments we report here the first crystal structure of a multiple pasta domain from ser thr kinase that of the protein serine threonine kinase  stk  from the firmicute staphylococcus aureus the extended conformation of the three pasta subunits differs strongly from the compact conformation observed in the two pasta domain of penicillin binding protein pbp x whereas linear conformations were also reported for two subunit fragments of the four pasta domain of the actinobacteria mycobacterium tuberculosis studied by liquid nmr thus a stretched organization appears to be the signature of modular pasta domains in ser thr kinases signal transduction to the kinase domain is supposed to occur via dimerization and ligand binding a conserved x shaped crystallographic dimer stabilized by intermolecular interactions between the second pasta subunits of each monomer is observed in the two crystal forms of stk that we managed to crystallize extracellular pasta domains are composed of at least two subunits and this molecular assembly is a plausible candidate for the biological dimer we have also performed docking experiments which predict that the hinge regions of the pasta domain can accommodate peptidoglycan finally a three dimensional homology molecular model of full length stk was generated suggesting an interaction between the kinase domain and the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane via a eukaryotic like juxtamembrane domain a comprehensive activation mechanism for bacterial ser thr kinases is proposed with the support of these structural data
