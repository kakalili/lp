multimodal and polymorphic interactions between anillin and actin their implications for cytokinesis
cytokinesis of animal cells requires the assembly of a contractile ring which promotes daughter cell splitting anillin is a conserved scaffold protein involved in organizing the structural components of the contractile ring including filamentous actin f actin  myosin and septins and in forming the subsequent midbody ring like other metazoan homologs drosophila anillin contains a conserved domain that can bind and bundle f actin but the importance and molecular details of its interaction with f actin remain unclear here we show that in a depletion and rescue assay in drosophila s cells anillin lacking the entire actin binding domain actbd exhibits defective cortical localization during mitosis and a greatly diminished ability to support cytokinesis using in vitro binding assays and electron microscopy on recombinant fragments we determine that the anillin actbd harbors three distinct actin binding sites abs     we show that each abs binds to a distinct place on f actin importantly abs and abs partially overlap on the surface of actin and therefore interact with f actin in a mutually exclusive fashion although abs and abs are sufficient for bundling abs contributes to the overall f actin bundling activity of anillin and enables anillin to switch between two actin bundling morphologies and promote the formation of three dimensional f actin bundles finally we show that in live s cells abs and abs are each required and together sufficient for the robust cortical localization of the actbd during cytokinesis collectively our structural biochemical and cell biological data suggest that multiple anillin  actin interaction modes promote the faithful progression of cytokinesis
