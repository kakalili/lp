a dimer of escherichia coli uvrd is the active form of the helicase in vitro
the escherichia coli uvrd protein is a   to   sf dna helicase involved in methyl directed mismatch repair and nucleotide excision repair of dna we have characterized in vitro uvrd catalyzed unwinding of a series of  bp duplex dna substrates with   single stranded dna ssdna tails ranging in length from two to  nt single turnover dna unwinding experiments were performed using chemical quenched flow methods as a function of both uvrd and dna under conditions such that uvrd  dna binding is stoichiometric although a single uvrd monomer binds tightly to the single stranded double stranded dna dsdna junction if the   ssdna tail is at least four nt no unwinding was observed for dna substrates with tail lengths   nt even at high uvrd  dna ratios unwinding is observed for dna substrates with   ssdna tail lengths   nt and the unwinding amplitude displays a sigmoidal dependence on uvrdtot  dnatot  quantitative analysis of these data indicates that a single uvrd monomer bound at the ssdna dsdna junction of any dna substrate independent of   ssdna tail length is not competent to fully unwind even a short  bp duplex dna and that two uvrd monomers must bind the dna substrate in order to form a complex that is able to unwind short dna substrates in vitro other proteins including a mutant uvrd with no atpase activity as well as a monomer of the structurally homologous e coli rep helicase cannot substitute for the second uvrd monomer suggesting a specific interaction between two uvrd monomers and that both must be able to hydrolyze atp initiation of dna unwinding in vitro appears to require a dimeric uvrd complex in which one subunit is bound to the ssdna dsdna junction while the second subunit is bound to the   ssdna tail
