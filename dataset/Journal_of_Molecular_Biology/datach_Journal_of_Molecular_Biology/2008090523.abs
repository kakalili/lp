tertiary structure and carbohydrate recognition by the chitin binding domain of a hyperthermophilic chitinase from pyrococcus furiosus
a chitinase is a hyperthermophilic glycosidase that effectively hydrolyzes both  and  crystalline chitins that studied here was engineered from the genes pf   and pf   of pyrococcus furiosus this chitinase has unique structural features and contains two catalytic domains ad and ad  and two chitin binding domains chbds chbd and chbd  a partial enzyme carrying ad and chbd also effectively hydrolyzes crystalline chitin we determined the nmr and crystal structures of chbd  which significantly enhances the activity of the catalytic domain there was no significant difference between the nmr and crystal structures the overall structure of chbd  which consists of two four stranded  sheets was composed of a typical  sandwich architecture and was similar to that of other carbohydrate binding module  family proteins despite low sequence similarity the chitin binding surface identified by nmr was flat and contained a strip of three solvent exposed trp residues trp   trp  and trp   flanked by acidic residues glu  and asp   these acidic residues form a negatively charged patch and are a characteristic feature of chbd  mutagenesis analysis indicated that hydrophobic interaction was dominant for the recognition of crystalline chitin and that the acidic residues were responsible for a higher substrate specificity of chbd for chitin compared with that of cellulose these results provide the first structure of a hyperthermostable chbd and yield new insight into the mechanism of protein  carbohydrate recognition this is important in the development of technology for the exploitation of biomass
