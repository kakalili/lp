diffusion of human replication protein a along single stranded dna
replication protein a rpa is a eukaryotic single stranded dna ssdna binding protein that plays critical roles in most aspects of genome maintenance including replication recombination and repair rpa binds ssdna with high affinity destabilizes dna secondary structure and facilitates binding of other proteins to ssdna however rpa must be removed from or redistributed along ssdna during these processes to probe the dynamics of rpa  dna interactions we combined ensemble and single molecule fluorescence approaches to examine human rpa hrpa diffusion along ssdna and find that an hrpa heterotrimer can diffuse rapidly along ssdna diffusion of hrpa is functional in that it provides the mechanism by which hrpa can transiently disrupt dna hairpins by diffusing in from ssdna regions adjacent to the dna hairpin hrpa diffusion was also monitored by the fluctuations in fluorescence intensity of a cy fluorophore attached to the end of ssdna using a novel method to calibrate the cy fluorescence intensity as a function of hrpa position on the ssdna we estimate a one dimensional diffusion coefficient of hrpa on ssdna of d   nt s   at   c diffusion of hrpa while bound to ssdna enables it to be readily repositioned to allow other proteins access to ssdna
