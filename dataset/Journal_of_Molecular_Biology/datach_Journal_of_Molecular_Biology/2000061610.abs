a minimum folding unit in the ankyrin repeat protein p ink  edited by c r matthews
the ankyrin repeat is an abundant   residue sequence motif that forms a consecutive  hairpin helix loop helix     fold most ankyrin repeat proteins consist of four or more complete repeats which provide stabilizing interactions between adjacent modules the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor and tumor suppressor p ink  p  is one of the smallest ankyrin repeat proteins with a known structure it consists of four complete repeats plus short n and c terminal flanking regions that are unstructured in solution on the basis of preliminary proteolysis studies and predictions using a computer algorithm for identifying autonomous folding units we have identified a fragment consisting of the third and fourth ankyrin repeats of p  called p c that can fold independently without the rest of the protein far uv circular dichroism studies showed that p c has a significant level of  helical secondary structure and two proline substitutions that disrupt the  helical secondary structure in wild type p  disrupt the secondary structure in p c the thermal denaturation of p c is cooperative and reversible with a midpoint of transition at      c from urea induced denaturation studies the free energy of unfolding for p c was estimated to be      kcal mol at   c  h  n d nmr studies suggest that the ankyrin repeats in p c are likely to fold into a structure similar to that of full length p  in order to define the minimum autonomous folding unit in p  we have further dissected p c into two complementary peptides each containing a single ankyrin repeat these peptides are unstructured in solution thus p c is the smallest ankyrin repeat module that is known to fold independently and in general we believe that the two ankyrin repeat fold could be the minimum structural unit for all ankyrin repeat proteins we further discuss the significance of p c in protein folding and engineering
