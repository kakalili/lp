tyrosine hydrogen bonds make a large contribution to protein stability edited by c r matthews
the aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of the contribution of hydrogen bonds by tyrosine oh groups to protein stability the amino acid sequences of rnases sa and sa are   identical and each contains eight tyr residues with seven at equivalent structural positions we have measured the stability of the  tyrosine to phenylalanine mutants for two equivalent mutants the stability increases by   kcal mol rnase sa y f and   kcal mol rnase sa y f   kcal     kj  for all of the other mutants the stability decreases with the greatest decrease being   kcal mol for rnase sa y f seven of the  tyrosine residues form intramolecular hydrogen bonds and the average decrease in stability for these is      kcal mol for the nine tyrosine residues that do not form intramolecular hydrogen bonds the average decrease in stability is      kcal mol thus most tyrosine oh groups contribute favorably to protein stability even if they do not form intramolecular hydrogen bonds generally the stability changes for equivalent positions in the two proteins are remarkably similar crystal structures were determined for two of the tyrosine to phenylalanine mutants of rnase sa y f      and y f      the structures are very similar to that of wild type rnase sa and the hydrogen bonding partners of the tyrosine residues always form intermolecular hydrogen bonds to water in the mutants these results provide further evidence that the hydrogen bonding and van der waals interactions of polar groups in the tightly packed interior of folded proteins are more favorable than similar interactions with water in the unfolded protein and that polar group burial makes a substantial contribution to protein stability
