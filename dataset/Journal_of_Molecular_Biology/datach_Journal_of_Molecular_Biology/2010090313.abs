charge rich regions modulate the anti aggregation activity of hsp
protein aggregation can have dramatic effects on cellular function and plays a causative role in many human diseases in all cells molecular chaperones bind to aggregation prone proteins and hinder aggregation the ability of a protein to resist aggregation and remain soluble in aqueous solution is linked to the physical properties of the protein numerous physical studies demonstrate that charged atoms favor solubility we note that many molecular chaperones possess a substantial negative charge that may allow them to impart solubility on aggregation prone proteins hsp  is one such negatively charged molecular chaperone the charge on hsp  is largely concentrated in two highly acidic regions to investigate the relationship between chaperone charge and protein solubility we deleted these charge rich regions and analyzed the resulting hsp  constructs for anti aggregation activity we found that deletion of both charge rich regions dramatically impaired hsp  anti aggregation activity the anti aggregation role of the deleted charge rich regions could be due to net charge or sequence specific features to distinguish these possibilities we attached an acid rich region with a distinct amino acid sequence to our double deleted hsp  construct this charge rescue construct displayed effective anti aggregation activity indicating that the net charge of hsp  contributes to its anti aggregation activity
