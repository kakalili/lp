the interaction mode of the acidic region of the cell cycle transcription factor dp with tfiih
the heterodimeric transcription factor e f dp plays crucial roles in coordinating gene expression during g s cell cycle progression for transcriptional activation the transactivation domain tad of e f is known to interact with the tata binding protein of tfiid and the p  subunit of tfiih it is generally believed that dp facilitates e f binding to target dna and does not possess a tad here we show that an acidic region of dp  whose function has remained elusive binds to the plekstrin homology ph domain of p  with higher affinity than that of e f and contributes to transcriptional activation the structure of the complex revealed that dp forms a twisted u shaped string like conformation and binds to the surface of the ph domain by anchoring phe  into a pocket in the ph domain the transcriptional activity of e f dp was reduced when phe  of dp was mutated these findings indicate that the acidic region of dp acts as a tad by contacting tfiih
