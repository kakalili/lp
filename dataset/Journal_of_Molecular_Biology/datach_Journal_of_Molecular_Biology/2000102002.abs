active site modulation in the n acetylneuraminate lyase sub family as revealed by the structure of the inhibitor complexed haemophilus influenzae enzyme edited by i a wilson
the n acetylneuraminate lyase nal sub family of     enzymes share a common catalytic step but catalyse reactions in different biological pathways known examples include nal dihydrodipicolinate synthetase dhdps  d  keto  deoxyglucarate dehydratase  keto  deoxygluconate aldolase trans o hydroxybenzylidenepyruvate hydrolase aldolase and trans   carboxybenzalpyruvate hydratase aldolase little is known about the way in which the three dimensional structure of the respective active sites are modulated across the sub family to achieve cognate substrate recognition we present here the structure of haemophilus influenzae nal determined by x ray crystallography to a maximum resolution of     in native form and in complex with three substrate analogues sialic acid alditol  deoxy sialic acid and  oxo sialic acid  these structures reveal for the first time the mode of binding of the complete substrate in the nal active site on the basis of the above structures that of substrate complexed dhdps and sequence comparison across the sub family we are able to propose a unified model for active site modulation the model is one of economy allowing wherever appropriate the retention or relocation of residues associated with binding common substrate substituent groups our structures also suggest a role for the strictly conserved tyrosine residue found in all active sites of the sub family namely that it mediates proton abstraction by the  keto acid carboxylate in a substrate assisted catalytic reaction pathway
