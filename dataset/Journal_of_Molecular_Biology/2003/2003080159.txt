Hydrogen exchange experiments under slow exchange conditions show that an omega loop in cytochrome c (residues 40â€“57) acts as a cooperative unfolding/refolding unit under native conditions. This unit behavior accounts for an initial step on the unfolding pathway, a final step in refolding, and a number of other structural, functional and evolutionary properties.
