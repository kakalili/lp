crystal structure of scytalidoglutamic peptidase with its first potent inhibitor provides insights into substrate specificity and catalysis
scytalidoglutamic peptidase sgp from scytalidium lignicolum is the founding member of the newly discovered family of peptidases g  so far found exclusively in fungi the crystal structure of sgp revealed a previously undescribed fold for peptidases and a unique catalytic dyad of residues gln  and glu   surprisingly the  sandwich structure of sgp is strikingly similar to members of the carbohydrate binding concanavalin a like lectins glucanases superfamily by analogy with the active sites of aspartic peptidases a mechanism employing nucleophillic attack by a water molecule activated by the general base functionality of glu  has been proposed here we report the first crystal structures of sgp in complex with two transition state peptide analogs designed to mimic the tetrahedral intermediate of the proteolytic reaction of these two analogs the one containing a central s hydroxyl group is a potent sub nanomolar inhibitor of sgp the inhibitor binds non covalently to the concave surface of the upper  sheet and enables delineation of the s to s   substrate specificity pockets of the enzyme structural differences in these pockets account for the unique substrate preferences of sgp among peptidases having an acidic ph optimum inhibitor binding is accompanied by a structuring of the region comprising residues tyr   gly  from being mostly disordered in the apoenzyme and leading to positioning of crucial active site residues for establishing enzyme  inhibitor contacts in addition conformational rearrangements are seen in a disulfide bridged surface loop cys   cys   which moves inwards partially closing the open substrate binding cleft of the native enzyme the non hydrolysable scissile bond analog of the inhibitor is located in the active site forming close contacts with gln  and glu   the nucleophilic water molecule is displaced and a unique mode of binding is observed with the s oh of the inhibitor occupying the oxyanion binding site of the proposed tetrahedral intermediate details of the enzyme  inhibitor interactions and mechanistic interpretations are discussed
