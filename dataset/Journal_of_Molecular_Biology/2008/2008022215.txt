Coronins are F-actin-binding proteins that are involved, in concert with Arp2/3, Aip1, and ADF/cofilin, in rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton. An understanding of coronin function has been hampered by the absence of any structural data on its interaction with actin. Using electron microscopy and three-dimensional reconstruction, we show that coronin-1A binds to three protomers in F-actin simultaneously: it bridges subdomain 1 and subdomain 2 of two adjacent actin subunits along the same long-pitch strand, and it staples subdomain 1 and subdomain 4 of two actin protomers on different strands. Such a mode of binding explains how coronin can stabilize actin filaments in vitro. In addition, we show which residues of F-actin may participate in the interaction with coronin-1A. Human nebulin and Xin, as well as Salmonella invasion protein A, use a similar mechanism to stabilize actin filaments. We suggest that the stapling of subdomain 1 and subdomain 4 of two actin protomers on different strands is a common mechanism for F-actin stabilization utilized by many actin-binding proteins that have no homology.
