twelve new mota dependent middle promoters of bacteriophage t  consensus sequence revised
bacteriophage t middle mode transcription requires escherichia coli rna polymerase phage encoded transcriptional activator mota and co activator asia that form a complex at a middle promoter dna t middle promoters have been defined by a consensus sequence deduced from the list of  middle promoters identified in earlier studies to date   middle promoters have been mapped on the t genome of these   contain differences even at the highly conserved positions of the consensus sequence in the t prereplicative gene cluster between genes e and rpba we have identified  new middle promoters most of which contain differences from the consensus sequence deduced previously analysis of base conservation in the different sequence positions of new middle promoters as well as those identified previously revealed some new features of middle t promoters we propose to define these promoters by a mota box a t a t a t tgcttta centred at the position    the sequence tataat centred at    relative to the transcriptional start site and the spacer region of     base pairs between them
