high throughput genetic identification of functionally important regions of the yeast dead box protein mss  p
the saccharomyces cerevisiae dead box protein mss  p is a general rna chaperone that functions in splicing mitochondrial group i and group ii introns recent x ray crystal structures of mss  p in complex with atp analogs and single stranded rna show that the helicase core induces a bend in the bound rna as in other dead box proteins while a c terminal extension cte induces a second bend resulting in rna crimping here we illuminate these structures by using high throughput genetic selections unigenic evolution and analyses of in vivo splicing activity to comprehensively identify functionally important regions and permissible amino acid substitutions throughout mss  p the functionally important regions include those containing conserved sequence motifs involved in atp and rna binding or interdomain interactions as well as previously unidentified regions including surface loops that may function in protein  protein interactions the genetic selections recapitulate major features of the conserved helicase motifs seen in other dead box proteins but also show surprising variations including multiple novel variants of motif iii sat  patterns of amino acid substitutions indicate that the rna bend induced by the helicase core depends on ionic and hydrogen bonding interactions with the bound rna identify a subset of critically interacting residues and indicate that the bend induced by the cte results primarily from a steric block finally we identified two conserved regions  one the previously noted post ii region in the helicase core and the other in the cte  that may help displace or sequester the opposite rna strand during rna unwinding
