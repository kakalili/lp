a cis prolyl peptide bond isomerization dominates the folding of the alpha subunit of trp synthase a tim barrel protein
the cis trans isomerization of prolyl peptide bonds has been suggested to dominate the folding of the alpha subunit of tryptophan synthase from escherichia coli  ts  to test the role of the unique cis isomer between asp  and pro  the folding properties of p a p g and g p g a three glycine insertion mutant between asp  and gly  were investigated using urea as a denaturant circular dichroism analysis demonstrated that none of the mutations perturb the secondary structure significantly although the aromatic side chain packing is altered for p a and p g all three mutant proteins inherited the three state thermodynamic behavior observed in wild type  ts ensuring that the fundamental features of the energy surface are intact kinetic studies showed that neither alanine nor glycine substitutions at pro  results in the elimination of any slow refolding phases by contrast the g p g mutant eliminates the fastest of the slow refolding phases and one of the two unfolding phases double jump experiments on g p g confirm the assignment of the missing refolding phase to the isomerization of the asp  pro  peptide bond these results imply that the local stability conveyed by the tight overlapping turns containing the cis peptide bond is sufficient to favor the cis isomer for several non prolyl residues the free energy required to drive the isomerization reaction is provided by the formation of the stable intermediate demonstrating that the acquisition of structure and stability is required to induce subsequent rate limiting steps in the folding of  ts
