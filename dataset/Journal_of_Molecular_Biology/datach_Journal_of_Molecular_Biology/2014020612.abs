light induced differences in conformational dynamics of the circadian clock regulator vivid
the lov light  oxygen  voltage domain protein vivid vvd is a negative regulator of the circadian transcription factor white collar complex and controls light response and photoadaptation in neurospora blue light converts vivid from the dark state into the light state vvdl with concomitant homodimerization upon return to low light conditions vvd very slowly reverts back into the monomeric dark state vvdd  to better understand the nature of the conformational changes that are the basis for the light  dark switch in vvd we used hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry to probe solvent accessibility of backbone amide protons our data demonstrate that all structural elements of vvdd except for the n cap region exchange according to the rare ex mechanism indicating a reversible unfolding with rather slow refolding rate interestingly the unfolding halftimes of different elements were not identical but varied from   to  s vvdl also exchanges according to the ex mechanism albeit with a halftime of h surprisingly the dimerization interface showed very little protection suggesting a rapid dimer  monomer interconversion
