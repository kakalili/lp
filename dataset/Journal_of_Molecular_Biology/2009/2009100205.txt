Gβ subunits from heterotrimeric G-proteins (guanine nucleotide-binding proteins) directly bind diverse proteins, including effectors and regulators, to modulate a wide array of signaling cascades. These numerous interactions constrained the evolution of the molecular surface of Gβ. Although mammals contain five Gβ genes comprising two classes (Gβ1-like and Gβ5-like), plants and fungi have a single ortholog, and organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster contain one copy from each class. A limited number of crystal structures of complexes containing Gβ subunits and complementary biochemical data highlight specific sites within Gβs needed for protein interactions. It is difficult to determine from these interaction sites what, if any, additional regions of the Gβ molecular surface comprise interaction interfaces essential to Gβ's role as a nexus in numerous signaling cascades. We used a comparative evolutionary approach to identify five known and eight previously unknown putative interfaces on the surface of Gβ. We show that one such novel interface occurs between Gβ and phospholipase C β2 (PLC-β2), a mammalian Gβ interacting protein. Substitutions of residues within this Gβ–PLC-β2 interface reduce the activation of PLC-β2 by Gβ1, confirming that our de novo comparative evolutionary approach predicts previously unknown Gβ–protein interfaces. Similarly, we hypothesize that the seven remaining untested novel regions contribute to putative interfaces for other Gβ interacting proteins. Finally, this comparative evolutionary approach is suitable for application to any protein involved in a significant number of protein–protein interactions.
