ph dependent interactions guide the folding and gate the transmembrane pore of the  barrel membrane protein ompg
the physical interactions that switch the functional state of membrane proteins are poorly understood previously the ph gating conformations of the  barrel forming outer membrane protein g ompg from escherichia coli have been solved when the ph changes from neutral to acidic the flexible extracellular loop l folds into and closes the ompg pore here we used single molecule force spectroscopy to structurally localize and quantify the interactions that are associated with the ph dependent closure at acidic ph we detected a ph dependent interaction at loop l  this interaction changed the un folding of loop l and of  strands  and   which connect loop l  all other interactions detected within ompg were unaffected by changes in ph these results provide a quantitative and mechanistic explanation of how ph dependent interactions change the folding of a peptide loop to gate the transmembrane pore they further demonstrate how the stability of ompg is optimized so that ph changes modify only those interactions necessary to gate the transmembrane pore
