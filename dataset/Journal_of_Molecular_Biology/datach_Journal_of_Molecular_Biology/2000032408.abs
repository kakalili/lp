crystal structure of a nifs like protein from thermotoga maritima implications for iron sulphur cluster assembly edited by k nagai
nifs like proteins are ubiquitous homodimeric proteins which belong to the  family of pyridoxal   phoshate dependent enzymes they are proposed to donate elementary sulphur generated from cysteine via a cysteinepersulphide intermediate during iron sulphur cluster biosynthesis an important albeit not well understood process here we report on the crystal structure of a nifs like protein from the hyperthermophilic bacterium thermotoga maritima tmnifs at    resolution the tmnifs is structured into two domains the larger bearing the pyridoxal   phosphate binding active site the smaller hosting the active site cysteine in the middle of a highly flexible loop   amino acid residues in length once charged with sulphur the loop could possibly deliver s directly to regions far remote from the protein based on the three dimensional structures of the native as well as the substrate complexed form and on spectrophotometric results a mechanism of sulphur activation is proposed the his  which stacks on top of the pyridoxal   phosphate co factor is assigned a crucial role during the catalytic cycle by acting as an acid base catalyst and is believed to have a pka value depending on the co factor redox state
