interaction of the repressor element  silencing transcription factor rest with target genes
the repressor element  silencing transcription factor rest has been proposed to restrict expression of repressor element  re  bearing genes to differentiated neurons by silencing their expression in non neural tissue here we have examined the interaction of rest with the m muscarinic acetylcholine receptor gene we show that rest binds to the re of the m gene in those cell lines and brain regions where the m gene is expressed but not in those where the m is not expressed furthermore in cells that express m  the presence of rest represses but is insufficient to silence transcription of m  in non neural cells rest is absent from the re of the silent m gene and perturbation of rest function fails to induce m expression we propose that rest acts to regulate expression levels of some re bearing genes in neural cells thereby playing an important role in defining neuronal activity
