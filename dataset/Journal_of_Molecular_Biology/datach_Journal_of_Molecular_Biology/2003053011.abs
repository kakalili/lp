structural requirement for mg  binding in the group i intron core
divalent metal ions are required for splicing of group i introns but their role in maintaining the structure of the active site is still under investigation ribonuclease and hydroxyl radical footprinting of a small group i intron from azoarcus pre trnaile showed that tertiary interactions between helical domains are stable in a variety of cations only mg  however induced a conformational change in the intron core that correlates with self splicing activity three metal ion binding sites in the catalytic core were identified by tb iii dependent cleavage two of these are near bound substrates in a three dimensional model of the ribozyme a third metal ion site is near an a minor motif in p  in the pre trna tb  cleavage was redirected to the   and   splice sites consistent with metal dependent activation of splice site phosphodiesters the results show that many counterions induce global folding but organization of the group i active site is specifically linked to mg  binding at a few sites
