crystal structure of rat liver betaine homocysteine s methyltransferase reveals new oligomerization features and conformational changes upon substrate binding
betaine homocysteine s methyltransferase bhmt is one of the two enzymes known to methylate homocysteine to generate methionine in the liver it presents a zn  atom linked to three essential cys residues the crystal structure of rat liver bhmt has been solved at    resolution using crystals with p  symmetry and   solvent content in the cell the asymmetric unit contains the whole functional tetramer showing point symmetry   the overall fold of the subunit consists mostly of a     barrel as for human bhmt from the end of the barrel the polypeptide chain extends away and makes many interactions with a different subunit forming tight dimers the most remarkable structural feature of rat liver bhmt is the presence of a helix including residues      at the c terminus of the chain which bind together the dimers ab to cd a strong ion pair and more than  hydrophobic interactions keep this helix stacked to the segment      from the opposite subunit moreover the crystal structure of free rat liver bhmt clearly shows that tyr  is the fourth ligand coordinated to zn which is replaced by hcy upon binding two residues essential for substrate recognition phe  and tyr  are provided by a conformational change in a partially disordered loop l  the crucial role of these residues is highlighted by site directed mutagenesis
