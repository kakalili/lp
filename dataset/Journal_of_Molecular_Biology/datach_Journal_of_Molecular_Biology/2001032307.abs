a like guanine guanine stacking in the aqueous dna duplex of d ggggcccc  edited by i tinoco
we have used cd spectroscopy nmr spectroscopy and unrestrained molecular dynamics to study conformational properties of a dna duplex formed by the self complementary octamer d ggggcccc  its unusual cd spectrum contains features indicating a like stacking of half of the bases whereas the other half stack in a b like fashion unrestrained molecular dynamics simulations converged to a stable b like double helix of d ggggcccc  however the double helix contained a central hole whose size was half of that occurring in structure a in the canonical structure b the hole does not exist at all because the base pairs cross the double helix centre the cytosine bases were stacked in the duplex of d ggggcccc as in structure b while stacking of the guanine bases displayed features characteristic for structure a nmr spectroscopy revealed that the a like guanine guanine stacking was accompanied by an increased tendency of the deoxyribose rings attached to the guanine bases to be puckered in an a like fashion otherwise the duplex of d ggggcccc showed no clash no bend and no other significant deviation from structure b the present analysis demonstrates a remarkable propensity of the guanine runs to stack in an a like fashion even within the b dna framework this property explains why the oligo dg  oligo dc tracts switch into structure a so easily secondly this property may influence replication because structure a is replicated more faithfully than structure b thirdly the oligo dg runs might have played an important role in early evolution when dna took on functions that originally evolved on rna fourthly the present study extends the vocabulary of dna secondary structures by the heteronomous duplex of d ggggcccc in which the b like strand of oligo dc is bound to the a like strand of oligo dg
