solution structure of a cyanobacterial phytochrome gaf domain in the red light absorbing ground state
the unique photochromic absorption behavior of phytochromes phys depends on numerous reversible interactions between the bilin chromophore and the associated polypeptide to help define these dynamic interactions we determined by nmr spectroscopy the first solution structure of the chromophore binding cgmp phosphodiesterase adenylcyclase fhla gaf domain from a cyanobacterial phy assembled with phycocyanobilin pcb  the three dimensional nmr structure of synechococcus os b  cyanobacterial phy  in the red light absorbing state of phy pr revealed that pcb is bound to cys  of the gaf domain via the a ring ethylidene side chain and is buried within the gaf domain in a zzzsyn syn anti configuration the d ring of the chromophore sits within a hydrophobic pocket and is tilted by approximately   relative to the b c rings by contacts with lys  and his   the solution structure revealed remarkable flexibility for pcb and several adjacent amino acids indicating that the pr chromophore has more freedom in the binding pocket than anticipated the propionic acid side chains of rings b and c and arg  and arg  nearby are especially mobile and can assume several distinct and energetically favorable conformations mutagenic studies on these arginines which are conserved within the phy superfamily revealed that they have opposing roles with arg  and arg  helping stabilize and destabilize the far red light absorbing state of phy pfr  respectively given the fact that the synechococcus os b  gaf domain can by itself complete the pr   pfr photocycle it should now be possible to determine the solution structure of the pfr chromophore and surrounding pocket using this pr structure as a framework
