high precision nmr structure of yhhp a novel escherichia coli protein implicated in cell division edited by m f summers
yhhp a small protein of  amino acid residues encoded by the yhhp gene in the escherichia coli database is implicated in cell division although the precise biological function of this protein has not been yet identified a variety of microorganisms have similar proteins all of which contain a common cpxp sequence motif in the n terminal region we have determined the three dimensional solution structure of yhhp by nmr spectroscopy in order to obtain insight into its biological function it folds into a two layered    sandwich structure with a       fold comprising a mixed four stranded  sheet stacked against two  helices both of which are nearly parallel to the strands of the  sheet the cpxp motif plays a significant structural role in stabilizing the first helix as a part of the new type n capping box where the cys pro peptide bond adopts a cis configuration the structure of yhhp displays a striking resemblance to the c terminal ribosome binding domain of translation initiation factor if  if c  in addition the surface charge distribution of the rna recognition helix of if c is nearly the same as that of the corresponding helix of yhhp these results suggest a structure based hypothesis in which binding to an rna target plays an essential role in the function of this ubiquitous protein
