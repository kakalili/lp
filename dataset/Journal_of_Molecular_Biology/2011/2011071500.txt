Examination of cultured insect vector cells that had been infected with Rice gall dwarf virus (RGDV), using transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscopy, revealed the presence of clusters of virus-coated mitochondria around viroplasms in which replication and assembly of RGDV occurred, suggesting a role for mitochondria in supplying the energy required for viral morphogenetic processes. Electron tomography revealed that RGDV particles on the surface of mitochondria are arrayed in an orderly but loose manner, unlike tightly packaged particles in vesicular compartments, suggesting the presence of counterpart molecules on the surface of mitochondria. The viral particles in close proximity to mitochondria were aligned along intermediate filaments, which might serve as scaffolds for the anchorage of these particles. RGDV has a putative mitochondrion-targeting sequence on the outer surface of the outer-capsid protein P8. The arrangement of RGDV particles around mitochondria suggests that the region of the P8 protein containing the mitochondrion-targeting sequence might attach to a molecule like a receptor on the outer mitochondrial membrane. Our analysis demonstrates the three-dimensional arrangement and molecular basis for the mitochondrial proximity of RGDV particles during viral replication.
