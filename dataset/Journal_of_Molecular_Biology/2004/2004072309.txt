Dyneins form one of the three major families of cytoskeleton-based motor proteins that together drive most of the visible forms of cell and organelle movement. We present here a 3D reconstruction of a cytoplasmic dynein motor domain obtained by electron microscopy, at 25Å resolution. This work demonstrates a basic motor architecture of a flat, slightly elliptical ring composed of seven densities arranged around a partially enclosed central cavity. We have used specific Fab tags to localize the microtubule-binding domain; the connecting stalk emerges at one end of the motor's long axis. Through proposed fitting of representative AAA domain structures, we show that the nucleotide catalytic P-1 domain is likely located at the opposite end of the motor. Thus mechanisms that couple nucleotide hydrolysis with microtubule binding must be propagated around a ring structure, in a manner clearly distinct from kinesin or myosin-mediated movements. Analysis of the Fab tagged datasets reveals classes of particles with stalks protruding at distinct angles from the motor. There is a ∼40° variation in microtubule-binding stalk angle that may reflect linkage to dynein's mechanochemical cycle. Overall, the work provides sufficient resolution to begin the mapping of landmark features onto a dynein motor, and provides a foundation for understanding the mechanics of dynein movement.
