distribution of molecular size within an unfolded state ensemble using small angle x ray scattering and pulse field gradient nmr techniques edited by p e wright
the size distribution of molecules within an unfolded state of the n terminal sh domain of drk drkn sh  has been studied by small angle x ray scattering saxs and pulsed field gradient nmr pfg nmr methods an empirical model to describe this distribution in the unfolded state ensemble has been proposed based on i the ensemble averaged radius of gyration and hydrodynamic radius derived from the saxs and pfg nmr data respectively and ii a histogram of the size distribution of structures obtained from preliminary analyses of structural parameters recorded on the unfolded state results show that this unfolded state uexch which exists in equilibrium with the folded state fexch under non denaturing conditions is relatively compact with the average size of conformers within the unfolded state ensemble only      larger than the folded state structure in addition the model predicts a significant overlap in the size range of structures comprising the uexch state with those in a denatured state obtained by addition of  m guanidinium chloride
