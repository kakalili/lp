role of intrinsic flexibility in signal transduction mediated by the cell cycle regulator p kip
p kip  p   which controls eukaryotic cell division through interactions with cyclin dependent kinases cdks  integrates and transduces promitogenic signals from various nonreceptor tyrosine kinases by orchestrating its own phosphorylation ubiquitination and degradation intrinsic flexibility allows p  to act as a  conduit  for sequential signaling mediated by tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation and ubiquitination while the structural features of the cdk cyclin binding domain of p  are understood how the c terminal regulatory domain coordinates multistep signaling leading to p  degradation is poorly understood we show that the   residue p  c terminal domain is extended and flexible when p  is bound to cdk cyclin a we propose that the intrinsic flexibility of p  provides a molecular basis for the sequential signal transduction conduit that regulates p  degradation and cell division other intrinsically unstructured proteins possessing multiple sites of posttranslational modification may participate in similar signaling conduits
