additional binding sites for anionic phospholipids and calcium ions in the crystal structures of complexes of the c domain of protein kinase c
the c domain of protein kinase c  pkc  corresponds to the regulatory sequence motif found in a large variety of membrane trafficking and signal transduction proteins that mediates the recruitment of proteins by phospholipid membranes in the pkc  isoenzyme the ca  dependent binding to membranes is highly specific to   sn phosphatidyl l serine intrinsic ca  binding tends to be of low affinity and non cooperative while phospholipid membranes enhance the overall affinity of ca  and convert it into cooperative binding the crystal structure of a ternary complex of the pkc  c domain showed the binding of two calcium ions and of one   dicaproyl sn phosphatidyl l serine dcps molecule that was coordinated directly to one of the calcium ions the structures of the c domain of pkc  crystallised in the presence of ca  with either   diacetyl sn phosphatidyl l serine daps or   dicaproyl sn phosphatidic acid dcpa have now been determined and refined at    and at    respectively daps a phospholipid with short hydrocarbon chains was expected to facilitate the accommodation of the phospholipid ligand inside the ca  binding pocket dcpa with a phosphatidic acid pa head group was used to investigate the preference for phospholipids with phosphatidyl l serine ps head groups the two structures determined show the presence of an additional binding site for anionic phospholipids in the vicinity of the conserved lysine rich cluster site directed mutagenesis on the lysine residues from this cluster that interact directly with the phospholipid revealed a substantial decrease in c domain binding to vesicles when concentrations of either ps or pa were increased in the absence of ca  in the complex of the c domain with daps a third ca  which binds an extra phosphate group was identified in the calcium binding regions cbrs  the interplay between calcium ions and phosphate groups or phospholipid molecules in the c domain of pkc  is supported by the specificity and spatial organisation of the binding sites in the domain and by the variable occupancies of ligands found in the different crystal structures implications for pkc  activity of these structural results in particular at the level of the binding affinity of the c domain to membranes are discussed
