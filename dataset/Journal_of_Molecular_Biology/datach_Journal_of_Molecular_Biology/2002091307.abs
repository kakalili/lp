structural properties of flih an atpase regulatory component of the salmonella type iii flagellar export apparatus
flih is a regulatory component for flii the atpase that is responsible for driving flagellar protein export in salmonella flih consists of   amino acid residues has a quite elongated shape exists as a homodimer and together with flii forms a heterotrimer here we have investigated the structural properties of the flih homodimer in further detail like intact his tagged flih homodimer fragment his flihn  consisting of the first   amino acid residues of flih  exhibited anomalous elution behavior in gel filtration chromatography the same was true of his flihc  consisting of amino acid residues       but to a much lesser degree thus the elongated shape of flih appears to derive primarily from its n terminal region a deletion version of n his flih lacking amino acid residues      does not dimerize and so we were able to establish the gel filtration properties of an almost full size monomeric form it also exhibited anomalous elution behavior we performed trypsin proteolysis of the flih homodimer and subjected the cleavage products to gel filtration chromatography flih was degraded by trypsin and a contaminating protease into two stable fragments flihprt  missing both the first ten and the last  amino acid residues  and flihprt  missing both the first ten and the last  amino acid residues  however substantial amounts remained undigested even after  hours under native conditions both flihprt and flihprt co eluted with undigested his flih from the gel filtration column indicating that the fragments exist as a hybrid dimer with intact flih these results suggest that the two subunits within the dimer differ in their proteolytic susceptibility no heterotrimer was observed by gel filtration chromatography when his flii was mixed with either his flih flihprt or his flih flihprt hybrid dimers a hybrid dimer of flih and his flih   lacking the first ten amino acid residues retained the ability to form a complex with his flii in contrast hybrid dimers consisting of flih and either his flih w  ochre or his flih v  ochre failed to complex to his flii demonstrating that the c terminal region of both flih monomers within the flih dimer are required for heterotrimer formation
