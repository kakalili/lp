Cytochrome P450s form a ubiquitous protein family with functions including the synthesis and degradation of many physiologically important compounds and the degradation of xenobiotics. Cytochrome P450cam from Pseudomonas putida has provided a paradigm for the structural understanding of cytochrome P450s. However, the mechanism by which camphor, the natural substrate of cytochrome P450cam, accesses the buried active site is a long-standing puzzle. While there is recent crystallographic and simulation evidence for opening of a substrate-access channel in cytochrome P450BM-3, for cytochrome P450cam, no such conformational changes have been observed either in different crystal structures or by standard molecular dynamics simulations. Here, a novel simulation method, random expulsion molecular dynamics, is presented, in which substrate-exit channels from the buried active site are found by imposing an artificial randomly oriented force on the substrate, in addition to the standard molecular dynamics force field. The random expulsion molecular dynamics method was tested in simulations of the substrate-bound structure of cytochrome P450BM-3, and then applied to complexes of cytochrome P450cam with different substrates and with product. Three pathways were identified, one of which corresponds to a channel proposed earlier on the basis of crystallographic and site-directed mutagenesis data. Exit via the water-filled channel, which was previously suggested to be a product exit channel, was not observed. The pathways obtained by the random expulsion molecular dynamics method match well with thermal motion pathways obtained by an analysis of crystallographic B-factors. In contrast to large backbone motions (up to 4 Å) observed in cytochrome P450BM-3 for the exit of palmitoleic acid, passage of camphor through cytochrome P450cam only requires small backbone motions (less than 2.4 Å) in conjunction with side-chain rotations. Concomitantly, in almost all the exit trajectories, salt-links that have been proposed to act as ionic tethers between secondary structure elements of the protein, are perturbed.
