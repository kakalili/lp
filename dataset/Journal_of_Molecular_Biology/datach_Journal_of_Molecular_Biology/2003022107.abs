a cdc a antagonizing k vitamin inhibits hepatocyte dna synthesis in vitro and in vivo
thioalkyl containing k vitamin analogs have been shown to be potent inhibitors of hepatoma cell growth and antagonizers of protein tyrosine phosphatase activity we now show that they inhibit the activity of specific protein tyrosine phosphatases ptp in cell free conditions in vitro particularly the dual specificity phosphatase cdc a using primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes that are in g g phase until stimulated into dna synthesis by epidermal growth factor we found that   mercaptoethanol  methyl   naphthoquinone or compound  cpd  inhibited hepatocyte dna synthesis and ptp activity in cell culture and in vivo after a two thirds partial hepatectomy we found a selective inhibition of cdc a activity in vitro using both synthetic substrates and authentic cellular substrate immunoprecipitated phospho cdk  intact cpd  treated cells had decreased cellular cdc a activity and increased tyrosine phosphorylation of cdk  resulting in decreased phosphorylation of retinoblastoma rb  loss of cdk activity was confirmed using cdk immunoprecipitates from either cpd  treated or untreated cells and measuring its kinase activity using gst rb as target we found a similar order of activity for inhibition of growth and cdc a activity using several thiol containing analogs cdc a inhibitors may thus be useful for defining biochemical pathways involving protein tyrosine phosphorylation that mediate cell growth inhibition
