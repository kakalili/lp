crystal structure of the iibsor domain of the sorbose permease from klebsiella pneumoniae solved to    resolution
the phosphoenolpyruvate transferase system pts is the major pathway by which bacteria import hexose sugars across the plasma membrane the pts transfers a phosphoryl group sequentially via several components from the glycolytic intermediate phosphoenolpyruvate pep to the translocated sugar it is comprised of the two general proteins enzyme i and hpr and a sugar specific enzyme ii complex sugar translocation is through the membrane domain of the enzyme ii complex the enzyme ii complex can belong to one of six families based upon sequence similarity with the sorbose transporter from klebsiella pneumoniae a member of the mannose family the structure of the iibsor domain was solved to    resolution by molecular replacement it has a central core of seven parallel  strands surrounded by a total of six  helices three helices cover the front face one the back face with the remaining two capping the central  sheet at the top and bottom the catalytic his  residue is situated on the surface exposed loop between strand  and helix  in addition to the features previously observed in the homologous iiblev domain from bacillus subtilis we see new features in the iibsor structure first the catalytic his  side chain is fixed in a specific conformation by forming a short hydrogen bond with asp  which in turn makes a salt bridge with arg  second as observed in other phosphoproteins an arginine residue arg  is well poised to stabilize a phosphoryl group on his  third we see an asp his pair reminiscent of that observed in the iiaman domain from escherichia coli finally docking of iiaman to iibsor shows that arg  in its current conformation is well positioned to assist the subsequent transfer of the phosphoryl group onto the sugar in line with previous mutagenesis studies
