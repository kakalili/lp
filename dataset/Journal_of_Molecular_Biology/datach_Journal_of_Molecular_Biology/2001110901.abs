a structural census of metabolic networks for e coli edited by b honig
a structural survey of the escherichia coli proteins occurring in metabolic networks in the kegg database release  of ligand has been carried out a measure of structural coverage of a network is defined and calculated for each network twentyfour networks have   or more of the enzyme steps assigned in e coli and of these  have a structural coverage of   or more for those proteins that have a region matching a scop domain   fall on or below the   sequence identity threshold and represent non trivial comparative modelling targets highlighting the need for experimental structure determination studies the survey reveals the predominance of    and    folds for enzymes involved in metabolic pathways and that this general trend is maintained at the level of each pathway the most popular superfamilies are coenzyme binding domains and are involved in the supply of energy to reactions although a few superfamilies are found in many pathways in general there is a specificity of a particular superfamily for a particular pathway
