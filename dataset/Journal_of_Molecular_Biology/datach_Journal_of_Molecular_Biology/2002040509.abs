n terminal n myristoylation of proteins prediction of substrate proteins from amino acid sequence edited by j thornton
myristoylation by the myristoyl coa protein n myristoyltransferase nmt is an important lipid anchor modification of eukaryotic and viral proteins automated prediction of n terminal n myristoylation from the substrate protein sequence alone is necessary for large scale sequence annotation projects but it requires a low rate of false positive hits in addition to a sufficient sensitivity our previous analysis of substrate protein sequence variability nmt sequences and d structures has revealed motif properties in addition to the known prosite motif that are utilized in a new predictor described here the composite prediction function with separate ad hoc parameterization a for queries from non fungal eukaryotes and their viruses and b for sequences from fungal species consists of terms evaluating amino acid type preferences at sequences positions close to the n terminus as well as terms penalizing deviations from the physical property pattern of amino acid side chains encoded in multi residue correlation within the motif sequence the algorithm has been validated with a self consistency and two jack knife tests for the learning set as well as with kinetic data for model substrates the sensitivity in recognizing documented nmt substrates is above   for both taxon specific versions the corresponding rate of false positive prediction for sequences with an n terminal glycine residue is close to    thus the technique is applicable for large scale automated sequence database annotation the predictor is available as public www server with the url http  mendel imp univie ac at myristate  additionally we propose a version of the predictor that identifies a number of proteolytic protein processing sites at internal glycine residues and that evaluates possible n terminal myristoylation of the protein fragments a scan of public protein databases revealed new potential nmt targets for which the myristoyl modification may be of critical importance for biological function among others the list includes kinases phosphatases proteasomal regulatory subunit  kinase interacting proteins kip kip  protozoan flagellar proteins homologues of mitochondrial translocase tom  of the neuronal calcium sensor ncs  and of the cytochrome c type heme lyase cchl analyses of complete eukaryote genomes indicate that about    of all encoded proteins are apparent nmt substrates except for a higher fraction in arabidopsis thaliana
