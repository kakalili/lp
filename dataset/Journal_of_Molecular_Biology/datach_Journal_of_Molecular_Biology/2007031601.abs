protein induced conformational changes of rna during the assembly of human signal recognition particle
the human signal recognition particle srp is a large rna  protein complex that targets secretory and membrane proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane the s domain of srp is composed of roughly half of the sl rna and four proteins srp  srp  and the srp   heterodimer  in order to understand how the binding of proteins induces conformational changes of rna and affects subsequent binding of other protein subunits we have performed chemical and enzymatic probing of all s domain assembly intermediates ethylation interference experiments show that phosphate groups in helices   and  that are essential for the binding of srp   are all on the same face of the rna hydroxyl radical footprinting and dimethylsulphate dms modifications show that srp   brings the lower part of helices  and  closer srp   binding also protects the srp  binding site helix  asymmetric loop from chemical modification and rnase cleavage whereas in the presence of both srp  and srp    the long strand of helix  asymmetric loop becomes readily accessible to chemical and enzymatic probes these results indicate that the rna platform observed in the crystal structure of the srp   srp m  rna complex already exists in the presence of srp   and srp  therefore srp    together with srp  rearranges the sl rna in an srp  binding competent state
