charge pair interactions in transmembrane helices and turn propensity of the connecting sequence promote helical hairpin insertion
helical hairpins consisting of a pair of closely spaced transmembrane tm helices that are connected by a short interfacial turn are the simplest structural motifs found in multi spanning membrane proteins in naturally occurring hairpins the presence of polar residues is common and predicted to complicate membrane insertion we postulate that the pre packing process offsets any energetic cost of allocating polar and charged residues within the hydrophobic environment of biological membranes consistent with this idea we provide here experimental evidence demonstrating that helical hairpin insertion into biological membranes can be driven by electrostatic interactions between closely separated poorly hydrophobic sequences additionally we observe that the integral hairpin can be stabilized by a short loop heavily populated by turn promoting residues we conclude that the combined effect of tm  tm electrostatic interactions and tight turns plays an important role in generating the functional architecture of membrane proteins and propose that helical hairpin motifs can be acquired within the context of the sec  translocon at the early stages of membrane protein biosynthesis taken together these data further underline the potential complexities involved in accurately predicting tm domains from primary structures
