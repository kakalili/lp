the role of meh  in actin polymerization and atp hydrolysis edited by r huber
in actin from many species h  is methylated but the function of this rare post translational modification is unknown although not within bonding distance it is located close to the  phosphate of the actin bound atp in most crystal structures of actin the   nitrogen of the methylated h  forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl of g   this hydrogen bond spans the gap separating subdomains  and  thereby contributing to the forces that close the interdomain cleft around the atp polyphosphate tail a second hydrogen bond stabilizing interdomain closure exists between r  and y  in the closed to open transition in  actin both of these hydrogen bonds are broken as the phosphate tail is exposed to solvent here we describe the isolation and characterization of a mutant  actin h a expressed in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae the properties of the mutant are compared to those of wild type  actin also expressed in yeast yeast does not have the methyl transferase necessary to methylate recombinant  actin thus the polymerization properties of yeast expressed wild type  actin can be compared with normally methylated  actin isolated from calf thymus since earlier studies of the actin atpase almost invariably employed rabbit skeletal  actin this isoform was included in these comparative studies on the polymerization atp hydrolysis and phosphate release of actin it was found that h a actin exchanged atp at an increased rate and was less stable than yeast expressed wild type actin indicating that the mutation affects the spatial relationship between the two domains of actin which embrace the nucleotide at physiological concentrations of mg  the kinetics of atp hydrolysis of the mutant actin were unaffected but polymer formation was delayed the comparison of methylated and unmethylated  actin revealed that in the absence of a methyl group on h  atp hydrolysis and phosphate release occurred prior to and seemingly independently of filament formation the comparison of  and  actin revealed differences in the timing and relative rates of atp hydrolysis and pi release
