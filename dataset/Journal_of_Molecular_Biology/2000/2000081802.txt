To explore the ways that proline residues may influence the conformational options of a polypeptide backbone, we have characterized Pro→Ala mutants of cellular retinoic acid-binding protein I (CRABP I). While all three Xaa-Pro bonds are in the trans conformation in the native protein and the equilibrium stability of each mutant is similar to that of the parent protein, each has distinct effects on folding and unfolding kinetics. The mutation of Pro105 does not alter the kinetics of folding of CRABP I, which indicates that the flexible loop containing this residue is passive in the folding process. By contrast, replacement of Pro85 by Ala abolishes the observable slow phase of folding, revealing that correct configuration of the 84–85 peptide bond is prerequisite to productive folding. Substitution of Pro39 by Ala yields a protein that folds and unfolds more slowly. Removal of the conformational constraint imposed by the proline ring likely raises the transition state barrier by increasing the entropic cost of narrowing the conformational ensemble. Additionally, the Pro→Ala mutation removes a helix-termination signal that is important for efficient folding to the native state.
