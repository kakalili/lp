epr spectra and molecular dynamics agree that the nucleotide pocket of myosin v is closed and that it opens on binding actin
we have used epr spectroscopy and computational modeling of nucleotide analog spin probes to investigate conformational changes at the nucleotide site of myosin v we find that in the absence of actin the mobility of a spin labeled diphosphate analog spin labeled adp sladp  bound at the active site is strongly hindered suggesting a closed nucleotide pocket the mobility of the analog increases when the mv sladp complex mv myosin v binds to actin implying an opening of the active site in the a mv sladp complex a actin  the probe mobilities are similar to those seen with myosin ii despite the fact that myosin v has dramatically altered kinetics molecular dynamics md simulation was used to understand the epr spectra in terms of the x ray database the x ray structure of mv adp befx shows a closed nucleotide site and has been proposed to be the detached state the mv adp structure shows an open nucleotide site and has been proposed to be the a mv adp state at the end of the working powerstroke md simulation of sladp docked in the closed conformation gave a probe mobility comparable to that seen in the epr spectrum of the mv sladp complex the simulation of the open conformation gave a probe mobility that was      greater than that observed experimentally for the a mv sladp state thus epr x ray diffraction and computational analysis support the closed conformation as a myosin v state that is detached from actin the md results indicate that the mv adp crystal structure which may correspond to the strained actin bound post powerstroke conformation resulting from head  head interaction in the dimeric processive motor is superopened
