comparative analysis of membrane associated fusion peptide secondary structure and lipid mixing function of hiv gp  constructs that model the early pre hairpin intermediate and final hairpin conformations
fusion between viral and host cell membranes is the initial step of human immunodeficiency virus infection and is mediated by the gp  protein which is embedded in the viral membrane the    residue n terminal fusion peptide fp region of gp  binds to the host cell membrane and plays a critical role in fusion catalysis key gp  fusion conformations include an early pre hairpin intermediate phi characterized by extended coiled coil structure in the region c terminal of the fp and a final hairpin state with compact six helix bundle structure the large  n    gp      and  fp hairpin  constructs of the present study contained the fp and respectively modeled the phi and hairpin conformations comparison was also made to the shorter  fp    gp      fragment studies were done in membranes with physiologically relevant cholesterol content and in membranes without cholesterol in either membrane type there were large differences in fusion function among the constructs with little fusion induced by fp hairpin moderate fusion for fp  and very rapid fusion for n  overall our findings support acceleration of gp  induced membrane fusion by early phi conformation and fusion arrest after folding to the final six helix bundle structure fp secondary structure at leu of the membrane associated constructs was probed by solid state nuclear magnetic resonance and showed populations of molecules with either  sheet or helical structure with greater  sheet population observed for fp  than for n  or fp hairpin the large differences in fusion function among the constructs were not obviously correlated with fp secondary structure observation of cholesterol dependent fp structure for fusogenic fp  and n  and cholesterol independent structure for non fusogenic fp hairpin was consistent with membrane insertion of the fp for fp  and n  and with lack of insertion for fp hairpin membrane insertion of the fp may therefore be associated with the early phi conformation and fp withdrawal with the final hairpin conformation
