a new cryo em single particle ab initio reconstruction method visualizes secondary structure elements in an atp fueled aaa motor
the generation of ab initio three dimensional  d models is a bottleneck in the studies of large macromolecular assemblies by single particle cryo electron microscopy we describe here a novel method in which established methods for two dimensional image processing are combined with newly developed programs for joint rotational d alignment of a large number of class averages rad and calculation of d volumes from aligned projections volrec  we demonstrate the power of the method by reconstructing an    kda atp fueled aaa motor to     resolution with secondary structure elements identified throughout the structure we propose the method as a generally applicable automated strategy to obtain d reconstructions from unstained single particles imaged in vitreous ice
