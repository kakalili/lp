structure and function of a mycobacterial nhej dna repair polymerase
non homologous end joining nhej mediated repair of dna double strand breaks in prokaryotes requires ku and a specific multidomain dna ligase ligd  we present crystal structures of the primase polymerisation domain poldom of mycobacterium tuberculosis ligd alone and complexed with nucleotides the poldom structure combines the general fold of the archaeo eukaryotic primase aep superfamily with additional loops and domains that together form a deep cleft on the surface likely used for dna binding enzymatic analysis indicates that the poldom of ligd even in the absence of accessory domains and ku proteins has the potential to recognise dna end joining intermediates strikingly one of the main signals for the specific and efficient binding of poldom to dna is the presence of a   phosphate group located at the single double stranded junction at both gapped and   protruding dna molecules although structurally unrelated pol  and pol   the two eukaryotic dna polymerases involved in nhej are endowed with a similar capacity to bind a   phosphate group other properties that are beneficial for nhej such as the ability to generate template distortions and realignments of the primer displayed by pol  and pol   are shared by the poldom of bacterial ligd in addition poldom can perform non mutagenic translesion synthesis on termini containing modified bases significantly ribonucleotide insertion appears to be a recurrent theme associated with nhej maximised in this case by the deployment of a dedicated primase although its in vivo relevance is unknown
