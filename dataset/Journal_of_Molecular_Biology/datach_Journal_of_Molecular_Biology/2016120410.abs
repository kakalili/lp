effects of bni binding on septin filament organization
septins are a protein family found in all eukaryotes except higher plants that have roles in membrane remodeling and formation of diffusion barriers and as a scaffold to recruit other proteins in budding yeast proper execution of cytokinesis and cell division requires the formation of a collar of circumferential filaments at the bud neck these filaments are assembled from apolar septin hetero octamers currently little is known about the mechanisms that control the arrangement and dynamics of septin structures in this study we utilized both f rster resonance energy transfer and electron microscopy to analyze the biophysical properties of the septin binding protein bni and how its association with septin filaments affects their organization we found that the interaction of bni with the terminal subunit cdc  at the junctions between adjacent hetero octamers in paired filaments is highly cooperative both the c terminal end of bni and the c terminal extension of cdc  make important contributions to their interaction moreover this binding may stabilize the dimerization of bni  which in turn forms cross filament braces that significantly narrow and impose much more uniform spacing on the gap between paired filaments
