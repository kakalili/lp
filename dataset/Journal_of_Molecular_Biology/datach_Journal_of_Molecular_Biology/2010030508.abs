crystal structure of argp from mycobacterium tuberculosis confirms two distinct conformations of full length lysr transcriptional regulators and reveals its function in dna binding and transcriptional regulation
mycobacterium tuberculosis presents a challenging medical problem partly due to its persistent nonreplicative state the inhibitor of chromosomal replication icia protein encoded by m tuberculosis has been suggested to inhibit chromosome replication initiation in vitro however icia has also been identified as arginine permease argp  a regulatory transcription factor for arginine outward transport in order to understand the function of argp we have determined its crystal structure by x ray crystallography to a resolution of     argp is a member of the lysr type transcriptional regulators lttrs and forms a homodimer with each subunit containing two domains a dna binding domain dbd and a regulatory domain rd  two conformationally distinct subunits were identified closed subunit and open subunit this phenomenon was first observed in lttr cbnr but not in lttr crga and might be common in lttrs we identified two forms of dimers dbd type dimers and rd type dimers the former is confirmed in solution and the latter is considered to form oligomers during function we provide the first structural insights into the interaction of the extreme c terminal residues with the dbd which is confirmed by mutagenesis and analytical ultracentrifugation to be important for stability of the functional dimer the structure serves as a model to suggest how three critical aspects namely dna binding homo oligomerization and interaction with rnap are mediated during regulation processing a model is proposed for the lysr family of dimeric regulators
