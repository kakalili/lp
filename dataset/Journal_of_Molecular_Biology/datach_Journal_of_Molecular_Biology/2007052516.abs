rapid folding and unfolding of apaf  card
caspase recruitment domains cards are members of the death domain superfamily and contain six antiparallel helices in an  helical greek key topology we have examined the equilibrium and kinetic folding of the card of apaf  apoptotic protease activating factor   which consists of  amino acid residues at ph  and ph  the results showed that an apparent two state equilibrium mechanism is not adequate to describe the folding of apaf  card at either ph suggesting the presence of intermediates in equilibrium unfolding interestingly the results showed that the secondary structure is less stable than the tertiary structure based on the transition mid points for unfolding single mixing and sequential mixing stopped flow studies showed that apaf  card folds and unfolds rapidly and suggest a folding mechanism that contains parallel channels with two unfolded conformations folding to the native conformation kinetic simulations show that a slow folding phase is described by a third conformation in the unfolded ensemble that interconverts with one or both unfolded species overall the native ensemble is formed rapidly upon refolding this is in contrast to other cards in which folding appears to be dominated by formation of kinetic traps
