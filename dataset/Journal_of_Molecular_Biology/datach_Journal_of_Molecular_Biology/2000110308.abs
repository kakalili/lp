structure of a mutant ef g reveals domain iii and possibly the fusidic acid binding site edited by i a wilson
the crystal structure of thermus thermophilus elongation factor g ef g carrying the point mutation his  ala was determined at a resolution of     the mutant has a more closed structure than that previously reported for wild type ef g this is obtained by a   rigid rotation of domains iii iv and v with regard to domains i and ii this rotation results in a displacement of the tip of domain iv by approximately    the structure of domain iii is now fully visible and reveals the double split     motif also observed for ef g domain v and for several ribosomal proteins a large number of fusidic acid resistant mutations found in domain iii have now been possible to locate possible locations for the effector loop and a possible binding site for fusidic acid are discussed in relation to some of the fusidic acid resistant mutations
