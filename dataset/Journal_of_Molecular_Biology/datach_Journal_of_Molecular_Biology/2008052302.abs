unusual role of a cysteine residue in substrate binding and activity of human ap endonuclease
the mammalian ap endonuclease ape  repairs apurinic apyrimidinic ap sites and strand breaks with   blocks in the genome that are formed both endogenously and as intermediates during base excision repair ape has an unrelated activity as a redox activator and named ref  for several trans acting factors in order to identify whether any of the seven cysteine residues in human ape affects its enzymatic function we substituted these singly or multiply with serine the repair activity is not affected in any of the mutants except those with c s mutation the ser  containing mutant lost affinity for dna and its activity was inhibited by   mm mg  however the ser  mutant has normal activity in  mm mg  using crystallographic data and molecular dynamics simulation we have provided a mechanistic basis for the altered properties of the c s mutant we earlier predicted that mg  with potential binding sites a and b binds at the b site of wild type ape  substrate complex and moves to the a site after cleavage occurs as observed in the crystal structure the ape  substrate complex is stabilized by a h bond between his  and the ap site we now show that this bond is broken to destabilize the complex in the absence of the mg  this effect due to the mutation of cys       from the active site on the dna binding and activity is surprising mg  at the b site promotes stabilization of the c s mutant complex at higher mg  concentration the a site is also filled causing the b site mg  to shift together with the ap site at the same time the h bond between his  and the ap site shifts toward the   site of dna these shifts could explain the lower activity of the c s mutant at higher mg   the unexpected involvement of cys  in ape s substrate binding and catalysis provides an example of involvement of a residue far from the active site
