fluorescence based assay to measure the real time kinetics of nucleotide incorporation during transcription elongation
understanding the mechanism and fidelity of transcription by the rna polymerase rnap requires measurement of the dissociation constant kd of correct and incorrect ntps and their incorporation rate constants kpol  currently such parameters are obtained from radiometric based assays that are both tedious and discontinuous here we report a fluorescence based assay for measuring the real time kinetics of single nucleotide incorporation during transcription elongation the fluorescent adenine analogue  aminopurine was incorporated at various single positions in the template or the nontemplate strand of the promoter free elongation substrate on addition of the correct ntp to the t rnap dna  aminopurine fluorescence increased rapidly and exponentially with a rate constant similar to the rna extension rate obtained from the radiometric assay the fluorescence stopped flow assay therefore provides a high throughput way to measure the kinetic parameters of rna synthesis using this assay we report the kpol and kd of all four correct ntp additions by t rnap which showed a range of values of      s   and       m respectively the fluorescent elongation substrates were used to determine the misincorporation kinetics as well which showed that t rnap discriminates against incorrect ntp both at the nucleotide binding and incorporation steps the fluorescence based assay should be generally applicable to all dna dependent rnaps as they use similar elongation substrates it can be used to elucidate the mechanism fidelity and sequence dependency of transcription and is a rapid means to screen for inhibitors of rnaps for therapeutic purposes
