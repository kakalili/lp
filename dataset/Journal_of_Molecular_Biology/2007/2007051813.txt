Peroxisomal biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are caused by mutations in 12 distinct genes that encode the components of the peroxisome assembly machinery. Three mutations in the gene encoding Pex5p, the peroxisomal targeting signal type-1 (PTS1) receptor, have been reported, each associated with a disorder of the Zellweger spectrum of different severity. Here, we report studies of the affinities of mutated forms of Pex5p for a series of PTS1 peptides and conclude that PTS1-affinity reductions are correlated with disease severity and cell biological phenotype. A quantitative model has been developed that allows estimation of the dissociation constants for complexes with a wide range of PTS1 sequences bound to wild-type and mutant Pex5p. In the context of this model, the binding measurements suggest that no PTS1-containing proteins are targeted by Pex5p(N489K) and only a relatively small subset of PTS1-containing proteins with the highest affinity for Pex5p are targeted to peroxisomes by Pex5p(S563W). Furthermore, the results of the analysis are consistent with an approximate dissociation constant threshold near 500Â nM required for efficient protein targeting to peroxisomes.
