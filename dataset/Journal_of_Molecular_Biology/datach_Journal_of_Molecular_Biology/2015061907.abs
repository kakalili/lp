sallimus and the dynamics of sarcomere assembly in drosophila flight muscles
the drosophila indirect flight muscles ifm can be used as a model for the study of sarcomere assembly here we use a transgenic line with a green fluorescent protein gfp exon inserted into the z disc proximal portion of sallimus sls  also known as drosophila titin to observe sarcomere assembly during ifm development firstly we confirm that sls gfp can be used in the heterozygote state without an obvious phenotype in ifm and other muscles we then use sls gfp in the ifm to show that sarcomeres grow individually and uniformly throughout the fibre growing linearly in length and in diameter finally we show that limiting the amounts of sls in the ifm using rnai leads to sarcomeres with smaller z discs in their core whilst the thick thin filament lattice can form peripherally without a z disc thick filament preparations from those muscles show that although the z disc containing core has thick filaments of a regular length filaments from the peripheral lattice are longer and asymmetrical around the bare zone therefore the z disc and sls are required for thick filament length specification but not for the assembly of the thin thick filament lattice
