linear remodeling of helical virus by movement protein binding
previously we have shown that encapsidated potato virus x pvx rna was nontranslatable in vitro but could be converted into a translatable form by binding of the pvx coded movement protein termed tgbp  to one end of a polar helical pvx virion we reported that binding of tgbp to coat protein cp subunits located at one extremity of the helical particles induced a linear destabilization of the cp helix which was transmitted along the whole particle two model structures were used  i native pvx and ii artificial polar helical pvx like particles lacking intact rna pvxrna deg  binding of tgbp to the end of either of these particles led to their destabilization but no disassembly of the cp helix occurred influence of additional factors was required to trigger rapid disassembly of tgbp pvx and tgbp pvxrna deg complexes thus  i no disassembly was observed unless tgbp pvx complex was translated a novel phenomenon of tgbp dependent ribosome triggered disassembly of pvx was described initiation of translation and few translocation steps were needed to trigger rapid and presumably cooperative disassembly of tgbp pvx into protein subunits and rna importantly the whole of the rna molecule including its   terminal region was released the tgbp induced linear destabilization of cp helix was reversible suggesting that pvx in tgbp pvx complex was metastable  ii entire disassembly of the tgbp pvxrna deg complex but not of the tgbp free pvxrna deg particles into  s subunits was triggered under influence of a centrifugal field to our knowledge transmission of the linear destabilization along the polar helical protein array induced by a foreign protein binding to the end of the helix represents a novel phenomenon it is tempting to suggest that binding of tgbp to the end of the pvx cp helix induced conformational changes in terminal cp subunits that can be linearly transferred along the whole helical particle i e that intersubunit conformational changes may be transferred along the cp helix
