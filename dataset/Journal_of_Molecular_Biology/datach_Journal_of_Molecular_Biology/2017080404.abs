biochemical and structural analyses of two cryptic esterases in bacteroides intestinalis and their synergistic activities with cognate xylanases
arabinoxylans are constituents of the human diet although not utilizable by the human host they can be fermented by colonic bacteria the arabinoxylan backbone is decorated with arabinose side chains that may be substituted with ferulic acid thus limiting depolymerization to fermentable sugars we investigated the polypeptides encoded by two genes upregulated during growth of the colonic bacterium bacteroides intestinalis on wheat arabinoxylan the recombinant proteins designated bifae a and bifae b were functionally assigned esterase activities both enzymes were active on acetylated substrates although each showed a higher ferulic acid esterase activity on methyl ferulate bifae a showed a catalytic efficiency of  mm s   on para nitrophenyl acetate and on methyl ferulate the value was  times higher bifae b showed low catalytic efficiencies for both substrates furthermore the two enzymes released ferulic acid from various structural elements and nmr spectroscopy indicated complete de esterification of arabinoxylan oligosaccharides from wheat bran bifae a is a tetramer based on the crystal structure whereas bifae b is a dimer in solution based on size exclusion chromatography the structure of bifae a was solved to    resolution and two tetramers were observed in the asymmetric unit a flexible loop that may act as a hinge over the active site and likely coordinates critical interactions with the substrate was prominent in bifae a sequence alignments of the esterase domains in bifae b with the feruloyl esterase from clostridium thermocellum suggest that both domains lack the flexible hinge in bifae a an observation that may partly provide a molecular basis for the differences in activities in the two esterases
