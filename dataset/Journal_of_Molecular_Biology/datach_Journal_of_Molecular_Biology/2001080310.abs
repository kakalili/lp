interplay between an aaa module and an integrin i domain may regulate the function of magnesium chelatase edited by d rees
in chlorophyll biosynthesis insertion of mg  into protoporphyrin ix is catalysed in an atp dependent reaction by a three subunit bchi bchd and bchh enzyme magnesium chelatase in this work we present the three dimensional structure of the atp binding subunit bchi the structure has been solved by the multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion method and refined at    resolution to the crystallographic r factor of     rfree      it belongs to the chaperone like  atpase associated with a variety of cellular activities   aaa family of atpases with a novel arrangement of domains the c terminal helical domain is located behind the nucleotide binding site while in other known aaa module structures it is located on the top examination by electron microscopy of bchi solutions in the presence of atp demonstrated that bchi like other aaa proteins forms oligomeric ring structures analysis of the amino acid sequence of subunit bchd revealed an aaa module at the n terminal portion of the sequence and an integrin i domain at the c terminus an acidic proline rich region linking these two domains is suggested to contribute to the association of bchi and bchd by binding to a positively charged cleft at the surface of the nucleotide binding domain of bchi analysis of the amino acid sequences of bchi and bchh revealed integrin i domain binding sequence motifs these are proposed to bind the integrin i domain of bchd during the functional cycle of magnesium chelatase linking porphyrin metallation by bchh to atp hydrolysis by bchi an integrin i domain and an acidic and proline rich region have been identified in subunit cobt of cobalt chelatase clearly demonstrating its homology to bchd these findings for the first time provide an insight into the subunit organisation of magnesium chelatase and the homologous colbalt chelatase
