role of the structure of the top half of hiv  ctar dna on the nucleic acid destabilizing activity of the nucleocapsid protein ncp
the viral nucleic acid chaperone protein ncp of hiv  assists the two obligatory strand transfers required for the conversion of the genomic rna into double stranded dna by reverse transcriptase the first strand transfer necessitates the annealing of the early product of cdna synthesis the minus strand strong stop dna ss cdna to the   end of the genomic rna the hybridization reaction involves regions containing imperfect stem loop sl structures namely the tar rna at the   end of the genomic rna and the complementary sequence ctar at the   end of ss cdna to pursue the characterization of the interaction between ncp and ctar dna we investigated by absorbance steady state and time resolved fluorescence spectroscopy the interaction of ncp with wild type and mutated dnas representing the top half of ctar ncp was found to activate the transient melting of this ctar dna structure but less efficiently than that of ctar lower half the ncp induced destabilization of ctar top half is dependent upon the three nucleotides bulging out of the stem which thus represent a melting initiation site in contrast despite its ability to bind ncp  the top loop does not play any significant role in ncp mediated melting thermodynamic data further suggest that ncp mediated destabilization of this ctar structure correlates with the free energy changes afforded by destabilizing motifs like loops and bulges within the sl secondary structure interestingly since ncp melts only short double stranded sequences destabilizing motifs need to be regularly positioned along the genomic sequence in order to promote strand transfer and thus genetic recombination during proviral dna synthesis
