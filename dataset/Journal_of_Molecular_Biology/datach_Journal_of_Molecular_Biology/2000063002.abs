correlated motions in native proteins from ms analysis of nh exchange evidence for a manifold of unfolding reactions in ovomucoid third domain edited by p e wright
native state amide hydrogen exchange monitored by nmr spectroscopy and mass spectrometry ms has the potential to provide detailed residue level information regarding correlated motions occurring on the microseconds to seconds timescale to expand the applicability of ms to these studies a new algorithm has been developed to interpret ms data for exchange occurring between the ex and ex kinetic limits re interpretation of ms data for ovomucoid third domain reveals multiple unfolding or partial unfolding reactions
