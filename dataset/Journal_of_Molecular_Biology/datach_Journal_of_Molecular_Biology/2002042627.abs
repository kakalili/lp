crystal structures and structural comparison of thermoactinomyces vulgaris r    amylase  tvai at    resolution and  amylase  tvaii at    resolution
the x ray crystal structures of thermoactinomyces vulgaris r    amylase  tvai and  amylase  tvaii have been determined at    and    resolution respectively the structures of tvai and tvaii have been refined r factor of    rfree    and        respectively with good chemical geometries both tvai and tvaii have four domains n a b and c and all very similar in structure however there are some differences in the structures between them domain n of tvai interacts strongly with domains a and b giving a spherical shape structure to the enzyme while domain n of tvaii is isolated from the other domains which leads to the formation of a dimer tvai has three bound ca ions whereas tvaii has only one tvai has eight extra loops compared to tvaii while tvaii has two extra loops compared to tvai tvai can hydrolyze substrates more efficiently than tvaii with a high molecular mass such as starch while tvaii is much more active against cyclodextrins than tvai and other  amylases a structural comparison of the active sites has clearly revealed this difference in substrate specificity
