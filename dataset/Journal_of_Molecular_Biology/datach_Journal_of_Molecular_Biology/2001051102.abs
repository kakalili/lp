solution structure backbone dynamics and chitin binding of the anti fungal protein from streptomyces tendae t    edited by m f summers
afp is a recently discovered anti fungal chitin binding protein from streptomyces tendae t    mature afp comprises  residues and exhibits limited sequence similarity to the cellulose binding domains of bacterial cellulases and xylanases no similarity to the cys and gly rich domains of plant chitin binding proteins e g agglutinins lectins hevein is observed afp is the first chitin binding protein from a bacterium for which anti fungal activity was shown here we report the three dimensional solution structure of afp  determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy the protein contains two antiparallel  sheets five and four  strands each  that pack against each other in a parallel  sandwich this type of architecture is conserved in the functionally related family ii of cellulose binding domains albeit with different connectivity a similar fold is also observed in other unrelated proteins spore coat protein from myxococcus xanthus   b and  b crystallins from bos taurus canavalin from jack bean  afp is therefore classified as a new member of the   crystallin superfamily the dynamics of the protein was characterized by nmr using amide  n relaxation and solvent exchange data we demonstrate that the protein exhibits an axially symmetric oblate like rotational diffusion tensor whose principal axis coincides to within   with that of the inertial tensor after completion of the present structure of afp  an identical fold was reported for a streptomyces killer toxin like protein based on sequence comparisons and clustering of conserved residues on the protein surface for different cellulose and chitin binding proteins we postulate a putative sugar binding site for afp  the inability of the protein to bind short chitin fragments suggests that certain particular architectural features of the solid chitin surface are crucial for the interaction
