activation of the proapoptotic death receptor dr by oligomeric peptide and antibody agonists
the cell extrinsic apoptotic pathway triggers programmed cell death in response to certain ligands that bind to cell surface death receptors apoptosis is essential for normal development and homeostasis in metazoans and furthermore selective activation of the cell extrinsic pathway in tumor cells holds considerable promise for cancer therapy we used phage display to identify peptides and synthetic antibodies that specifically bind to the human proapoptotic death receptor dr  despite great differences in overall size and structure the dr binding peptides and antibodies shared a tripeptide motif which was conserved within a disulfide constrained loop of the peptides and the third complementarity determining region of the antibody heavy chains the x ray crystal structure of an antibody in complex with dr revealed that the tripeptide motif is buried at the core of the interface confirming its central role in antigen recognition we found that certain peptides and antibodies exhibited potent proapoptotic activity against dr expressing sk mes  lung carcinoma cells these phage derived ligands may be useful for elucidating dr activation at the molecular level and for creating synthetic agonists of proapoptotic death receptors
