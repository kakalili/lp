micromechanics of isolated sickle cell hemoglobin fibers bending moduli and persistence lengths edited by i tinoco
pathogenesis in sickle cell disease depends on polymerization of deoxyhemoglobin s into rod like fibers forming gels that rigidify red cells and obstruct the systemic microvasculature fiber structure polymerization kinetics and equilibria are well characterized and intimately related to pathogenesis however data on gel rheology the immediate cause of obstruction are limited and models for structure and rheology are lacking the basis of gel rheology micromechanics of individual fibers has never been examined here we isolate fibers by selective depolymerization of gels produced under photolytic deliganding of co hemoglobin s using differential interference contrast dic microscopy we measure spontaneous thermal fluctuations in fiber shape to obtain bending moduli   and persistence lengths  p  some fibers being too stiff to decompose shape accurately into fourier modes we measure deviations of fiber midpoints from mean positions serial deviations sufficiently separated to be independent exhibit gaussian distributions and provide mean squared fluctuation amplitudes from which  and  p can be calculated  p ranges from   to  mm for the most flexible and stiffest fibers respectively this large range reflects formation of fiber bundles if the most flexible are single fibers then  p   mm represents a bundle of seven single fibers preliminary data on the bending variations of frozen hydrated single fibers of hbs obtained by electron microscopy indicate that the value   mm is consistent with the persistence length of single fibers young  s modulus is   gpa less than for structural proteins but much larger than for extensible proteins we consider how these results used with models for cross linking may apply to macroscopic rheology of hemoglobin s gels this new technique combining isolation of hemoglobin s fibers and measurement of micromechanical properties based on thermal fluctuations and midpoint deviations can be used to study fibers of mutants hemoglobin a s and mixtures and hybrids of hemoglobin s
