the n terminal basic domain of human parvulin hpar  is responsible for the entry to the nucleus and high affinity dna binding
we have studied the cellular localization and the dna binding capability of human peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerase hpar  the cellular expression pattern shows an uneven distribution of the protein between cytoplasm and nucleus to determine the nuclear localization of hpar  in vivo the molecule was fused to green fluorescent protein and expressed in human hela cells deletion mutants of hpar  were used to restrict a sequence necessary for nuclear targeting to ser lys  of the n terminus of the protein dna  cellulose affinity experiments were performed to demonstrate that hpar  which is present in the nuclear fraction could bind to double stranded native dna in vitro on the basis of homologies and similarities of hpar  to members of the high mobility group proteins double stranded dna constructs were developed and tested for their hpar  binding affinity in fluorescence titration assays the protein binds preferentially to bent a tract sequences the binding interface of the protein was determined by  d and  d nmr studies of the complex of unlabeled dna and uniformly  n labeled hpar       experiments with a truncated hpar       showed that the unstructured n terminal  amino acid residues are necessary for high affinity binding to dna these findings in connection with sequence and structural homologies of hpar  to members of the hmgb hmgn protein family suggest a function of hpar  in cell cycle regulation or gene transcription
