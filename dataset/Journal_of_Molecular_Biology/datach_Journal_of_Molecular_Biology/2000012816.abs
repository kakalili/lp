probing a trna core that contributes to aminoacylation edited by d e draper
the contribution of the trna  core  to aminoacylation is beginning to be recognized one example is the core region of escherichia coli trnacys which has been shown by biochemical studies to be important for aminoacylation this core has several layers of unusual base pairs which are revealed by the recent crystal structure of the trna complexed with the elongation factor ef tu and an analog of gtp one of these layers consists of a      base triple rather than the      or      base triple that is commonly observed in trna structure because    is an important element in aminoacylation of e coli trnacys a better understanding of its structure in the trna core will shed light on its role in aminoacylation in this study we used the phage t transcript of the trna as a substrate we probed the structure of    by dimethyl sulfate and tested its partner in a base triple by generating mutations that could be assayed for aminoacylation the results of this study in general are in a better agreement with a      base triple that we previously proposed although these results are not interpreted as direct proof for the      base triple they shed new light on features of the trna core that are important for aminoacylation
