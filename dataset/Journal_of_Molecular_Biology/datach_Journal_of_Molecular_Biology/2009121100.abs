conformational flexibility and peptide interaction of the translocation atpase seca
the seca atpase forms a functional complex with the protein conducting secy channel to translocate polypeptides across the bacterial cell membrane seca recognizes the translocation substrate and catalyzes its unidirectional movement through the secy channel the recent crystal structure of the thermotoga maritima seca  secyeg complex shows the atpase in a conformation where the nucleotide binding domains nbds have closed around a bound adp  befx complex and seca s polypeptide binding clamp is shut here we present the crystal structure of t maritima seca in isolation determined in its adp bound form at     resolution seca alone has a drastically different conformation in which the nucleotide binding pocket between nbd and nbd is open and the preprotein cross linking domain has rotated away from both nbds thereby opening the polypeptide binding clamp to investigate how this clamp binds polypeptide substrates we also determined a structure of bacillus subtilis seca in complex with a peptide at     resolution this structure shows that the peptide augments the highly conserved  sheet at the back of the clamp taken together these structures suggest a mechanism by which atp hydrolysis can lead to polypeptide translocation
