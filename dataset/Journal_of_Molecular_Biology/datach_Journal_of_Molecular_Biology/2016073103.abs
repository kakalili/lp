monomeric form of peptidylarginine deiminase type i revealed by x ray crystallography and small angle x ray scattering
peptidylarginine deiminase pad ec      is a post translational modification enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of arginine in protein molecules to a citrulline residue in a ca  dependent manner in this study we determined the structure of an active form of human pad crystallized in the presence of ca  at    resolution although human pad and pad isozymes were previously reported to form a head to tail homodimer it is still unknown whether this quaternary structure is common to other pad isozymes the asymmetric unit of the crystal contained two pad molecules however the head to tail dimeric form was not found small angle x ray scattering analyses revealed pad to be a monomer in solution while pad was dimerized with a structure similar to pad and pad  pad was apparently different from the crystal structures of pad and pad  with an elongated n terminal loop that appears to prevent the formation of the homodimer of interest the n terminal loop occupied the substrate binding site of the adjacent pad molecules in the crystal deimination of s  a peptides in vitro implied that pad isozymes recognize the quaternary structure of s  a  the substrate accessible monomeric structure brought about by the extension of its n terminus may partly account for the highest tolerant substrate recognition of pad  this is the first ever report on the molecular structure of pad demonstrating the unique monomeric form of the pad isozyme
