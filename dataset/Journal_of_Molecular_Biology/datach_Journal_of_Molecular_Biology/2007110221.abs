investigating the substrate specificity and oligomerisation of the leader protease of foot and mouth disease virus using nmr
the leader protease lbpro of foot and mouth disease virus frees itself during translation from the viral polyprotein by cleavage between its own c terminus and the n terminus of the subsequent protein vp  lbpro also specifically cleaves the host proteins eukaryotic initiation factor eif  gi and gii thus disabling host cell protein synthesis we used nmr to study full length lbpro as well as a shortened species lacking six c terminal amino acid residues slbpro to examine the mechanism of self processing the quaternary structure and the substrate specificity both lbpro forms have the same structure in solution as in the crystal in the solution structure of slbpro the  residue c terminal extension was flexible and disordered in contrast the  residue c terminal extension of full length lbpro was bound by the substrate binding site of a neighbouring molecule resulting in the formation of a stable dimer in solution the lbpro dimer could not be dissociated by increasing the ionic strength or by dilution furthermore titration with model peptides mimicking the substrates destabilised the dimer interface without dissociating the dimer the peptides were however bound by slbpro in the canonical substrate binding site peptide binding gave rise to chemical shifts of residues around the slbpro substrate binding site shifts of asn  and glu  indicated that these residues might form the enzyme s s   site and interact with the p   arginine residue of the eif gi cleavage site furthermore differences in substrate specificity between slbpro and lbpro observed with an in vitro translated protein indicate some involvement of the c terminus in substrate recognition
