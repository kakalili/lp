distinct modes of recognition of the lipoyl domain as substrate by the e and e components of the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex
two dimensional  n heteronuclear single quantum coherence hsqc nmr studies with a di domain lipoyl domain linker peripheral subunit binding domain of the dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase e  component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex of bacillus stearothermophilus allowed a molecular comparison of the need for lipoic acid to be covalently attached to the lipoyl domain in order to undergo reductive acetylation by the pyruvate decarboxylase e  component in contrast with the ability of free lipoic acid to serve as substrate for the dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase e  component tethering the lipoyl domain to the peripheral subunit binding domain in a complex with e or e rendered the system more like the native enzyme complex compared with the use of a free lipoyl domain yet of a size still amenable to investigation by nmr spectroscopy recognition of the tethered lipoyl domain by e was found to be ensured by intensive interaction with the lipoyl lysine containing  turn and with residues in the protruding loop close to the  turn the size and sequence of this loop varies significantly between species and dictates the lipoylated lipoyl domain as the true substrate for e  in contrast with e the main interaction sites on the tethered lipoyl domain were revealed as residues asp  and ala  which form a conserved sequence motif dka around the lipoyl lysine residue no domain specificity is observed at this step and substrate channelling in the complex thus rests on the recognition of the lipoyl domain by the first enzyme e  the cofactor thiamine diphosphate and substrate pyruvate had distinct but contrasting effects on the e di domain interaction whereas nad and nadh had negligible effect on the e di domain interaction tethering the lipoyl domain did not significantly change the nature of its interaction with e compared with a free lipoyl domain indicative of the conformational freedom allowed by the linker in the movement of the lipoyl domain between active sites
