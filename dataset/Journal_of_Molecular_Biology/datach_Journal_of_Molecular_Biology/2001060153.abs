streptomycin resistant and streptomycin dependent mutants of the extreme thermophile thermus thermophilus edited by d e draper
we have isolated spontaneous streptomycin resistant streptomycin dependent and streptomycin pseudo dependent mutants of the thermophilic bacterium thermus thermophilus ib   all mutant phenotypes were found to result from single amino acid substitutions located in the rpsl gene encoding ribosomal protein s  spontaneous suppressors of streptomycin dependence were also readily isolated thermus rpsl mutations were found to be very similar to rpsl mutations identified in mesophilic organisms this similarity affords greater confidence in the utility of the crystal structures of thermus ribosomes to interpret biochemical and genetic data obtained with escherichia coli ribosomes in the x ray crystal structure of the t thermophilus hb   s subunit the mutated residues are located in close proximity to one another and to helices    and  of  s rrna x ray crystallographic analysis of ribosomes from streptomycin resistant streptomycin pseudo dependent and streptomycin dependent mutants described here is expected to reveal fundamental insights into the mechanism of trna selection translocation and conformational dynamics of the ribosome
