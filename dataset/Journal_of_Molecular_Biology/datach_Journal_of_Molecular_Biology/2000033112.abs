measurements of cysteine reactivity during protein unfolding suggest the presence of competing pathways edited by c r matthews
evidence that proteins may unfold utilizing complex competing pathways comes from a new pulse labeling protocol in which the change in reactivity of a single cysteine residue in a protein during unfolding is measured making use of its easily monitored reaction with the ellman reagent dithionitrobenzoic acid the kinetics of unfolding of two single cysteine containing mutant forms of the small protein barstar c a which contains only cys  and c a which contains only cys  have been studied the data suggest that unfolding occurs via two parallel pathways each forming competing intermediates in one of these early intermediates cys  and cys  are already as reactive as they are in the fully unfolded protein while in the other intermediate the cys thiol groups are unreactive one more long lived intermediate also needs to be included on the pathway defined by the early intermediate with unreactive cys thiol groups to account for the difference in the rates of fluorescence change and of change in cys  reactivity the demonstration of multiple intermediates and pathways for unfolding indicates that protein unfolding reactions can be as complex as protein folding reactions
