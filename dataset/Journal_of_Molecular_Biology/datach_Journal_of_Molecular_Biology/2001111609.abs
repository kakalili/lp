the     resolution structure of nicotiana alata sf  rnase associated with gametophytic self incompatibility edited by r huber
the crystal structure of nicotiana alata ornamental tobacco sf  rnase an s allelic glycoprotein associated with gametophytic self incompatibility was determined by x ray diffraction at     resolution the protein has a tertiary structure typical of members of the rnase t family as it consists of a variant of the     fold and has eight helices and seven strands a heptasaccharide moiety is also present and amino acid residues that serve as the catalytic acid and base can be assigned to his  and his  respectively two  hypervariable  regions known as hva and hvb are the proposed sites of s allele discrimination during the self incompatibility reaction and in the sf  rnase these are well separated from the active site hva and hvb are composed of a long positively charged loop followed by a part of an  helix and short negatively charged  helix respectively the sf  rnase structure shows both regions are readily accessible to the solvent and hence could participate in the process of self non self discrimination between the s rnase and an unknown pollen s gene product s upon pollination
