crystal structure of the e component of the escherichia coli  oxoglutarate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex
the thiamine dependent e o component ec     of the  oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex catalyses a rate limiting step of the tricarboxylic acid cycle tca of aerobically respiring organisms we describe the crystal structure of escherichia coli e o in its apo and holo forms at     and     resolution respectively the structures reveal the characteristic fold that binds thiamine diphosphate and resemble closely the    hetero tetrameric e components of other  oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes except that in e o the  and  subunits are fused as a single polypeptide the extended segment that links the  like and  like domains forms a pocket occupied by amp which is recognised specifically also distinctive to e o are n terminal extensions to the core fold and which may mediate interactions with other components of the  oxoglutarate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex the active site pocket contains a group of three histidine residues and one serine that appear to confer substrate specificity and the capacity to accommodate the tca metabolite oxaloacetate oxaloacetate inhibits e o activity at physiological concentrations and we suggest that the inhibition may allow coordinated activity within the tca cycle we discuss the implications for metabolic control in facultative anaerobes and for energy homeostasis of the mammalian brain
