thermodynamics and kinetics of non native interactions in protein folding a single point mutant significantly stabilizes the n terminal domain of l by modulating non native interactions in the denatured state
comparatively little is known about the role of non native interactions in protein folding and their role in both folding and stability is controversial we demonstrate that non native electrostatic interactions involving specific residues in the denatured state can have a significant effect upon protein stability and can persist in the transition state for folding mutation of a single surface exposed residue lys  to met in the n terminal domain of the ribosomal protein l  ntl  significantly increased the stability of the protein and led to faster folding structural and energetic studies of the wild type and k m mutant show that the  kcalmol   increase in stability is not due to native state effects but rather is caused by modulation of specific non native electrostatic interactions in the denatured state ph dependent stability measurements confirm that the increased stability of the k m is due to the elimination of favorable non native interactions in the denatured state kinetic studies show that the non native electrostatic interactions involving k  persist in the transition state the analysis demonstrates that canonical  values can arise from the disruption of non native interactions as well as from the development of native interactions
