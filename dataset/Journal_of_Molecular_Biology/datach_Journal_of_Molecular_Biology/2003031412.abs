interaction and assembly of murine pre replicative complex proteins in yeast and mouse cells
eukaryotic cells coordinate chromosome duplication by the assembly of protein complexes at origins of dna replication by sequential binding of member proteins of the origin recognition complex orc  cdc  and minichromosome maintenance mcm proteins these pre replicative complexes pre rcs are activated by cyclin dependent kinases and dbf cdc kinase here we carried out a comprehensive yeast two hybrid screen to establish sequential interactions between two individual proteins of the mouse pre rc that are probably required for the initiation of dna replication the studies revealed multiple interactions among orc subunits and mcm proteins as well as interactions between individual orc and mcm proteins in particular cdc was found to bind strongly to orc and orc  and to mcm proteins dbf interacts with the subunits of orc as well as with mcm proteins it was also demonstrated that cdc binds to different orc and mcm proteins cdc  interacts with orc and orc  and weakly with mcm    and   the three subunits of the single stranded dna binding protein rpa show interactions with various orc subunits as well as with several mcm proteins the data obtained by yeast two hybrid analysis were paradigmatically confirmed in synchronized murine fm a cells by immunoprecipitation of the interacting partners some of the interactions were found to be cell cycle dependent however most of them were cell cycle independent altogether   protein  protein interactions were detected in this study   of them were found for the first time in any eukaryotic pre rc these data may help to understand the complex interplay of the components of the mouse pre rc and should allow us to refine its structural architecture as well as its assembly in real time
