the role of rbfa in  s rrna processing and cell growth at low temperature in escherichia coli
rbfa a  s ribosome binding factor is a multicopy suppressor of a cold sensitive c u mutation of the  s rrna and is required for efficient processing of the  s rrna at   c  rbfa cells show accumulation of ribosomal subunits and  s rrna precursor with a significantly reduced polysome profile in comparison with wild type cells rbfa is also a cold shock protein essential for escherichia coli cells to adapt to low temperature in this study we examined its association with the ribosome and its role in  s rrna processing and ribosome profiles at low temperature in wild type cells following cold shock at   c the amount of free rbfa remained largely stable while that of its  s subunit associated form became several times greater than that at   c and a larger fraction of total  s subunits was detected to be rbfa containing in  rbfa cells the pre  s rrna amount increased after cold shock with a concomitant reduction of the mature  s rrna amount and the formation of polysomes was further reduced a closer examination revealed that  s ribosomal subunits of  rbfa cells at low temperature contained primarily pre  s rrna and little mature  s rrna our results indicate that the cold sensitivity of  rbfa cells is directly related to their lack of translation initiation capable  s subunits containing mature  s rrna at low temperature importantly when the c terminal  residue sequence was deleted the resulting rbfa   lost the abilities to stably associate with the  s subunit and to suppress the dominant negative cold sensitive phenotype of the c u mutation in  s rrna but was able to suppress the  s rrna processing defect and the cold sensitive phenotype of the  rbfa cells suggesting that rbfa may interact with the  s ribosome at more than one site or function in more than one fashion in assisting the  s rrna maturation at low temperature
