the n terminal domain of the regulatory subunit is sufficient for complete activation of acetohydroxyacid synthase iii from escherichia coli
we have previously proposed a model for the fold of the n terminal domain of the small regulatory subunit ssu of acetohydroxyacid synthase isozyme iii the fold is an     sandwich with       topology structurally homologous to the c terminal regulatory domain of  phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase we suggested that the n terminal domains of a pair of ssus interact in the holoenzyme to form two binding sites for the feedback inhibitor valine in the interface between them the model was supported by mutational analysis and other evidence we have now examined the role of the c terminal portion of the ssu by construction of truncated polypeptides lacking         or   amino acid residues from the c terminus and examining the properties of holoenzymes reconstituted using these constructs the       and   constructs all lead to essentially complete activation of the catalytic subunits the   construct corresponding to the putative n terminal domain has the highest level of affinity for the catalytic subunits and leads to a reconstituted enzyme with kcat km about twice that of the wild type enzyme on the other hand none of these constructs binds valine or leads to a valine sensitive enzyme on reconstitution the enzyme reconstituted with the   construct does not bind valine either the n terminal portion about  amino acid residues of the ssu is thus necessary and sufficient for recognition and activation of the catalytic subunits but the c terminal half of the ssu is required for valine binding and response we suggest that the c terminal region of the ssu contributes to monomer  monomer interactions and provide additional experimental evidence for this suggestion
