the pka values of acidic and basic residues buried at the same internal location in a protein are governed by different factors
the pka values of internal ionizable groups are usually very different from the normal pka values of ionizable groups in water to examine the molecular determinants of pka values of internal groups we compared the properties of lys asp and glu at internal position  in staphylococcal nuclease lys  titrates with a normal or elevated pka whereas asp  and glu  titrate with elevated pka values of   and   respectively in the structure of the l k variant the buried amino group of the lys  side chain makes an ion pair with glu   whereas in the structure of the l e variant the buried carboxyl group of glu  interacts with two backbone amides and has several nearby carboxyl oxygen atoms previously we showed that the pka of lys  is normal owing to structural reorganization and water penetration concomitant with ionization of the lys side chain in contrast the pka values of asp  and glu  are perturbed significantly owing to an imbalance between favorable polar interactions and unfavorable contributions from dehydration and from coulomb interactions with surface carboxylic groups their ionization is also coupled to subtle structural reorganization these results illustrate the complex interplay between local polarity coulomb interactions and structural reorganization as determinants of pka values of internal groups in proteins this study suggests that improvements to computational methods for pka calculations will require explicit treatment of the conformational reorganization that can occur when internal groups ionize
