high resolution structure of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor with altered binding loop sequence edited by r huber
a mutant of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor bpti has been constructed and expressed in escherichia coli in order to probe the kinetic and structural consequences of truncating the binding loop residues to alanine in addition to two such mutations thr ala and pro ala  it has a conservative lys arg substitution at position p and an unrelated met leu change in spite of the binding loop modification the affinity for trypsin is only  times lower than that of the wild type protein at ph   the protein can be crystallized on the time scale of hours yielding very stable crystals of a new tetragonal form of bpti conventional source x ray data collected to    at room temperature allowed anisotropic structure refinement characterized by r      the structure reveals all  residues including the complete c terminus which is in a salt bridge contact with the n terminus the cys  cys  disulfide bridge is observed in two distinct chiralities this bridge together with an internal water molecule contributes to the stabilization of the binding loop the ala mutations have only an insignificant and localized effect on the binding loop which retains its wild type conformation maximum deviation of loop c  atoms of    at ala   four instead of the typical three additional water molecules are buried in an internal cleft and connected to the surface via a sulfate anion three more so   anions are seen in the electron density one of them located on a  fold axis it participates in the formation of a dimeric structure between symmetry related bpti molecules in which electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions resulting from the mutated lys arg substitution are of central importance this dimeric interaction involves direct recognition loop recognition loop contacts part of which are hydrophobic interactions of the patches created by the alanine mutations another  fold symmetric interaction between the bpti molecules involves the formation of an antiparallel intermolecular  sheet that together with the adjacent intramolecular  hairpin loops creates a four stranded structure
