hyperphosphorylation of rna polymerase ii in response to topoisomerase i cleavage complexes and its association with transcription and brca dependent degradation of topoisomerase i
the progression of rna polymerase ii can be blocked by lesions on the dna template in this study we focused on the modifications of the largest subunit of rna polymerase ii rpb  in response to stabilized topoisomerase i top   dna cleavage complexes in addition to dna modifications base damages and strand breaks  top cleavage complexes can be trapped by camptothecin cpt and its derivatives used in cancer treatment we found that within a few minutes cpt produces the complete hyperphosphorylation of rpb in both primary and transformed cancer cells hyperphosphorylation is rapidly reversible following cpt removal hyperphosphorylation occurs selectively on the serine  residue of the conserved heptapeptide repeats in the rpb carboxy terminal domain and is mediated principally by the transcription factor iih associated cyclin dependent kinase cdk  hyperphosphorylated rpb is not primarily targeted for proteosomal degradation and instead is subjected to cycles of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation as long as top cleavage complexes are trapped by cpt finally we show that transcription induced degradation of top is brca dependent suggesting a role for brca in the repair or removal of transcription blocking top  dna cleavage complexes
