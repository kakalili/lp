Riboflavin is an essential cofactor in all organisms. Its direct biosynthetic precursor, 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine, is synthesised by the enzyme 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase. Recently, we have found that the enzyme from Schizosaccharomyces pombe binds riboflavin, the final product of the pathway with a relatively high affinity with a KD of 1.2μM.Here, we report on the crystal structure of lumazine synthase from S.pombe with bound riboflavin and compare the binding mode with those of the substrate analogue inhibitor 5-nitro-6-(d-ribitylamino)-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione and of the product analogue 6-carboxyethyl-7-oxo-8-ribityllumazine. In all complexes the pyrimidinedione moieties of each respective ligand bind in a very similar orientation. Binding of riboflavin additionally involves a stacking interaction of the dimethylbenzene moiety with the side-chain of His94, a highly conserved residue in all lumazine synthases. The enzyme from Bacillus subtilis showed a KD of at least 1mM whereas the very homologous enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae had a comparable KD of 3.9μM. Structural comparison of the S.cerevisiae, the S.pombe, and the mutant enzymes suggests that fine tuning of affinity is achieved by influencing this stacking interaction.
