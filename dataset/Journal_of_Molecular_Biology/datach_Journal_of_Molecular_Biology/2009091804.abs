the structural basis of  peptide specific cleavage by the serine protease cyanophycinase
cyanophycin or poly l asp  multi l arg is a non ribosomally synthesized peptidic polymer that is used for nitrogen storage by cyanobacteria and other select eubacteria upon synthesis it self associates to form insoluble granules the degradation of which is uniquely catalyzed by a carboxy terminal specific protease cyanophycinase we have determined the structure of cyanophycinase from the freshwater cyanobacterium synechocystis sp pcc   at    resolution showing that the structure is dimeric with individual protomers resembling aspartyl dipeptidase kinetic characterization of the enzyme demonstrates that the enzyme displays michaelis  menten kinetics with a kcat of    s   and a kcat km of       m   s   site directed mutagenesis experiments confirm that cyanophycinase is a serine protease and that gln   asp   gln   arg   arg  and arg   which form a conserved pocket adjacent to the catalytic ser   are functionally critical residues modeling indicates that cyanophycinase binds the  asp  arg dipeptide residue immediately n terminal to the scissile bond in an extended conformation in this pocket primarily recognizing this penultimate  asp  arg residue of the polymeric chain because binding and catalysis depend on substrate features unique to  linked aspartyl peptides cyanophycinase is able to act within the cytosol without non specific cleavage events disrupting essential cellular processes
