crystal structures of pristine and oxidatively processed lignin peroxidase expressed in escherichia coli and of the w  f variant that eliminates the redox active tryptophan   implications for the reaction mechanism edited by r huber
the heme enzyme lignin peroxidase lip from the white rot fungus phanerochaete chrysosporium contains a solvent exposed redox active tryptophan residue trp   that carries a unique hydroxy group stereo specifically attached to its c  atom a trp  phe mutant has no activity at all towards the substrate veratryl alcohol the mechanism of veratryl alcohol oxidation involving  hydroxy trp  is largely unknown here we present the first crystal structures of lip isozyme h at high resolution in its pristine non hydroxylated form of the c  hydroxylated form and of the trp  phe mutant using recombinantly expressed and refolded protein produced from escherichia coli as a consequence all structures are unglycosylated structural changes in response to the mutation are marginal and allow us to attribute the complete lack of activity exclusively to the absence of the redox active indole side chain the origin of the stereospecificity of the trp  hydroxylation can be explained on structural grounds a reaction mechanism involving trp  is proposed and the possible function of the modification is discussed another important result regarding the ongoing debate on the co ordination state of the heme iron in the resting state is that the iron is six co ordinate in all cases the data being collected at room temperature the mean distance from the iron to the distal water ligand is         the radical scavenger orcinol was found to decrease radiation damage to the crystals during data collection at room temperature
