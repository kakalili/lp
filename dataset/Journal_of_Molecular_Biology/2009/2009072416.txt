Site-specific recombinases have revolutionized the systematic generation of transgenic cell lines and embryonic stem cells/animals and will ultimately also reveal their potential in the genetic modification of induced pluripotent stem cells. Introduced in 1994, our Flp recombinase-mediated cassette exchange strategy permits the exchange of a target cassette for a cassette with the gene of interest, introduced as a part of an exchange vector. The process is “clean” in the sense that it does not co-introduce prokaryotic vector parts; neither does it leave behind a selection marker. Stringent selection principles provide master cell lines permitting subsequent recombinase-mediated cassette exchange cycles in the absence of a drug selection and with a considerable efficiency (∼10%). Exemplified by Chinese hamster ovary cells, the strategy proves to be successful even for cell lines with an unstable genotype.
