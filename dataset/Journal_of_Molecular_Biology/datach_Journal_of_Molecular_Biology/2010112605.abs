structural insights on the new mechanism of trehalose synthesis by trehalose synthase tret from pyrococcus horikoshii
many microorganisms produce trehalose for stability and survival against various environmental stresses unlike the widely distributed trehalose  biosynthetic pathway which utilizes uridine diphosphate glucose and glucose  phosphate the newly identified enzyme trehalose glycosyltransferring synthase tret from hyperthermophilic bacteria and archaea synthesizes an    trehalose from nucleoside diphosphate glucose and glucose in the present study we determined the crystal structure of tret from pyrococcus horikoshii at     resolution to understand the detailed mechanism of this novel trehalose synthase the conservation of essential residues in tret and the high overall structural similarity of the n terminal domain to that of trehalose phosphate synthase tps imply that the catalytic reaction of tret for trehalose synthesis would follow a similar mechanism to that of tps the acceptor binding site of tret shows a wide and commodious groove and lacks the long flexible loop that plays a gating role in ligand binding in tps the observation of a wide space at the fissure between two domains and the relative shift of the n domain in one of the crystal forms suggest that an interactive conformational change between two domains would occur allowing a more compact architecture for catalysis the structural analysis and biochemical data in this study provide a molecular basis for understanding the synthetic mechanism of trehalose or the nucleotide sugar in reverse reaction of the tret in extremophiles that may have important industrial implications
