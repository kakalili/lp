analysis of catalytic residues in enzyme active sites
we present an analysis of the residues directly involved in catalysis in   enzyme active sites specific criteria were derived to define a catalytic residue and used to create a catalytic residue dataset which was then analysed in terms of properties including secondary structure solvent accessibility flexibility conservation quaternary structure and function the results indicate the dominance of a small set of amino acid residues in catalysis and give a picture of a general active site environment it is hoped that this information will provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in catalysis and a heuristic basis for predicting catalytic residues in enzymes of unknown function
