structural determinants of the adam inhibition by timp  crystal structure of the tace n timp  complex
timp  tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases  is unique among the timp inhibitors in that it effectively inhibits the tnf  converting enzyme tace  in order to understand this selective capability of inhibition we crystallized the complex formed by the catalytic domain of recombinant human tace and the n terminal domain of timp  n timp   and determined its molecular structure with x ray data to    resolution the structure reveals that timp  exhibits a fold similar to those of timp  and timp  and interacts through its functional binding edge which consists of the n terminal segment and other loops with the active site cleft of tace in a manner similar to that of matrix metalloproteinases mmps  therefore the mechanism of timp  binding toward tace is not fundamentally different from that previously elucidated for the mmps the phe  phenyl side chain situated at the tip of the relatively short sa sb loop of timp  extends into a unique hydrophobic groove of the tace surface and two leu residues in the adjacent sc connector and se sf loops are tightly packed in the interface allowing favourable interactions in agreement with predictions obtained by systematic mutations by gillian murphy s group the combination of favourable functional epitopes together with a considerable flexibility renders timp  an efficient tace inhibitor this structure might provide means to design more efficient timp inhibitors of tace
