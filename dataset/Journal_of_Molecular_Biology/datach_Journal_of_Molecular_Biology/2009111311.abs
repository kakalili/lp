molecular interplay between the replicative helicase dnac and its loader protein dnai from geobacillus kaustophilus
helicase loading factors are thought to transfer the hexameric ring shaped helicases onto the replication fork during dna replication however the mechanism of helicase transfer onto dna remains unclear in bacillus subtilis the protein dnai which belongs to the aaa family of atpases is responsible for delivering the hexameric helicase dnac onto dna here we investigated the interaction between dnac and dnai from geobacillus kaustophilus hta   gkdnac and gkdnai respectively and determined that gkdnai forms a stable complex with gkdnac with an apparent stoichiometry of gkdnac  gkdnai in the absence of atp surface plasmon resonance analysis indicated that gkdnai facilitates loading of gkdnac onto single stranded dna ssdna and supports complex formation with ssdna in the presence of atp additionally the gkdnai c terminal aaa domain alone could bind ssdna and binding was modulated by nucleotides we also determined the crystal structure of the c terminal aaa domain of gkdnai in complex with adp at     resolution the structure not only delineates the binding of adp in the expected walker a and b motifs but also reveals a positively charged region that may be involved in ssdna binding these findings provide insight into the mechanism of replicative helicase loading onto ssdna
