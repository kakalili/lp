a lim  fhl  scpl  scp complex interacts with the c terminal protein kinase regions of unc   obscurin in caenorhabditis elegans muscle
the c elegans gene unc  encodes a set of mostly giant polypeptides up to   kda that contain multiple immunoglobulin ig and fibronectin type  fn  a triplet of sh dh ph and two protein kinase domains the loss of function mutant phenotype and localization of antibodies to unc  proteins indicate that the function of unc  is to help organize sarcomeric a bands especially m lines recently we reported that each of the protein kinase domains interacts with scpl  which contains a ctd type protein phosphatase domain here we report that scpl  interacts with lim  fhl  a protein that we first discovered as an interactor of unc   pinch and unc   components of an m line costamere in nematode muscle we show that lim  can interact with unc  through its first kinase domain and a portion of unique sequence lying between the two kinase domains all the interactions were confirmed by biochemical methods a yeast three hybrid assay demonstrates a ternary complex between the two protein kinase regions and scpl  evidence that the unc  scpl  interaction occurs in vivo was provided by showing that over expression of scpl  results in disorganization of unc  at m lines we suggest two structural models for the interactions of scpl  and lim  with unc  at the m line
