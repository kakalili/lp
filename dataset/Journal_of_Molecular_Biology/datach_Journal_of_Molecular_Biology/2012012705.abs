human dna polymerase  is pre aligned for dntp binding and catalysis
pre steady state kinetic studies on y family dna polymerase   pol  have suggested that the polymerase undergoes a rate limiting conformational change step before the phosphoryl transfer of the incoming nucleotide to the primer terminus however the nature of this rate limiting conformational change step has been unclear due in part to the lack of structural information on the pol  binary complex we present here for the first time a crystal structure of human pol  hpol  in binary complex with its dna substrate we show that the hpol  domains move only slightly on dntp binding and that the polymerase by and large is pre aligned for dntp binding and catalysis we also show that there is no major reorientation of the dna from a nonproductive to a productive configuration and that the active site is devoid of metals in the absence of dntp together these observations lead us to suggest that the rate limiting conformational change step in the pol  replication cycle likely corresponds to a rate limiting entry of catalytic metals in the active site
