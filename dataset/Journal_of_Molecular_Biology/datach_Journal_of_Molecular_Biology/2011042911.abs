elucidating substrate and inhibitor binding sites on the surface of gsk   and the refinement of a competitive inhibitor
a molecular understanding of substrate recognition of protein kinases provides an important basis for the development of substrate competitive inhibitors here we explored substrate recognition and competitive inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase gsk   using molecular and computational tools in previous work we described gln  and asn  within gsk   as important substrates binding sites here we show that the cavity bordered by loop  qdkrfkn   located in the vicinity of the gsk   catalytic core is a promiscuous substrate binding subsite mutations within this segment highlighted phe  as an additional essential contact residue for substrates recognition however unlike gln  and asn  phe  was also important for the binding of our previously described substrate competitive inhibitor l   keappappqs p p  and its cell permeable variant l  mts the effects of the substitution of charged or polar residues within l  further suggested that binding to gsk   is governed by hydrophobic interactions our computational model of gsk   bound to l  was in agreement with the experimental data it revealed l  binding with a hydrophobic surface patch and identified interactions between pro  l   and phe  gsk    computational modeling of new l  variants predicted that inhibition would be strengthened by adding contacts with phe  or by increasing the hydrophobic content of the peptide indeed the newly designed l  variants showed improved inhibition our study identified different and overlapping elements in gsk   substrate and inhibitor recognition and provides a novel example for model based rational design of substrate competitive inhibitors for gsk
