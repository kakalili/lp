sars coronavirus unique domain three domain molecular architecture in solution and rna binding
nonstructural protein  of the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus includes a  sars unique domain   sud consisting of three globular domains separated by short linker peptide segments this work reports nmr structure determinations of the c terminal domain sud c and a two domain construct sud mc containing the middle domain sud m and the c terminal domain and nmr data on the conformational states of the n terminal domain sud n and the sud nm two domain construct both sud n and sud nm are monomeric and globular in solution in sud nm there is high mobility in the two residue interdomain linking sequence with no preferred relative orientation of the two domains sud c adopts a frataxin like fold and has structural similarity to dna binding domains of dna modifying enzymes the structures of both sud m previously determined and sud c from the present study are maintained in sud mc where the two domains are flexibly linked gel shift experiments showed that both sud c and sud mc bind to single stranded rna and recognize purine bases more strongly than pyrimidine bases whereby sud mc binds to a more restricted set of purine containing rna sequences than sud m nmr chemical shift perturbation experiments with observations of  n labeled proteins further resulted in delineation of rna binding sites i e  in sud m a positively charged surface area with a pronounced cavity and in sud c several residues of an anti parallel  sheet  overall the present data provide evidence for molecular mechanisms involving the concerted actions of sud m and sud c which result in specific rna binding that might be unique to the sud and thus to the sars coronavirus
