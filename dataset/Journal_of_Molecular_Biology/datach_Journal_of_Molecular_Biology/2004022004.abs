inhibitory effect of tis on sp c ebp  transcription factor module activity
the transcription factors c ebp  and sp functionally interact to induce expression of specific genes during myeloid and epithelial cell differentiation the c ebp  sp transcription factor  module  binds to enhancer elements within the upstream regulatory sequences of target genes in our previous study we identified mouse tpa inducible sequence  tis  as a novel co repressor in epithelial cells undergoing loss of polarity increased levels of tis down regulate the transcription of a specific set of genes using bioinformatic analysis we identified a common binding site for the c ebp  sp transcription factor module within the upstream regulatory regions of tis regulated genes the inhibitory effect of tis on c ebp  sp mediated transcription was confirmed by reporter assays our data showed that the tis effect was mediated through specific interference with sp transcriptional activity furthermore tis prevented formation of a complex between sp protein and its consensus dna binding site data presented here further specify the mechanism of action of the transcriptional co repressor tis as well as document the strength of a bioinformatic approach for the prediction and analysis of transcription factor modules
