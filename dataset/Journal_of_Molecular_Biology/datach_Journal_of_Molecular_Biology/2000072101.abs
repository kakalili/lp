role of domains  and  in elongation factor g functions on the ribosome
elongation factor g ef g is a large five domain gtpase that catalyses the translocation of the trnas on the bacterial ribosome at the expense of gtp in the crystal structure of gdp bound ef g domain  g domain makes direct contacts with domains  and  whereas domain  protrudes from the body of the molecule here we show that the presence of both domains  and  is essential for trna translocation and for the turnover of the factor on the ribosome but not for rapid single round gtp hydrolysis by ef g replacement of a highly conserved histidine residue at the tip of domain  his   with lysine or arginine decreases the rate of trna translocation at least   fold whereas the binding of the factor to the ribosome gtp hydrolysis and pi release are not affected by the mutations various small deletions in the tip region of domain  decrease the translocation activity of ef g even further but do not block the turnover of the factor unlike native ef g the mutants of ef g lacking domains   do not interact with the  sarcin stem loop of  s rrna these mutants are not released from the ribosome after gtp hydrolysis or translocation indicating that the contact with or a conformational change of the  sarcin stem loop is required for ef g release from the ribosome
