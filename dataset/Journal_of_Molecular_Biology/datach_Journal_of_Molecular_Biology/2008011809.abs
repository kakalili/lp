prevention of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure by silencing of nf  b
activation of the nuclear factor nf  b signaling pathway may be associated with the development of cardiac hypertrophy and its transition to heart failure hf  the transgenic myo tg mouse develops hypertrophy and hf as a result of overexpression of myotrophin in the heart associated with an elevated level of nf  b activity using this mouse model and an nf  b targeted gene array we first determined the components of nf  b signaling cascade and the nf  b linked genes that are expressed during the progression to cardiac hypertrophy and hf second we explored the effects of inhibition of nf  b signaling events by using a gene knockdown approach rna interference through delivery of a short hairpin rna against nf  b p  using a lentiviral vector l sh p   when the short hairpin rna was delivered directly into the hearts of  week old myo tg mice there was a significant regression of cardiac hypertrophy associated with a significant reduction in nf  b activation and atrial natriuretic factor expression our data suggest for the first time that inhibition of nf  b using direct gene delivery of sh p  rna results in regression of cardiac hypertrophy these data validate nf  b as a therapeutic target to prevent hypertrophy hf
