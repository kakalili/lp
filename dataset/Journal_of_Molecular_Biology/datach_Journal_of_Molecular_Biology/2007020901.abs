kinetics of different processes in human insulin amyloid formation
human insulin has long been known to form amyloid fibrils under given conditions the molecular basis of insulin aggregation is relevant for modeling the amyloidogenesis process which is involved in many pathologies as well as for improving delivery systems used for diabetes treatments insulin aggregation displays a wide variety of morphologies from small oligomeric filaments to huge floccules and therefore different specific processes are likely to be intertwined in the overall aggregation in the present work we studied the aggregation kinetics of human insulin at low ph and different temperatures and concentrations the structure and the morphogenesis of aggregates on a wide range of length scales from monomeric proteins to elongated fibrils and larger aggregates networks have been monitored by using different experimental techniques time lapse atomic force microscopy afm  quasi elastic light scattering qls  small and large angle static light scattering thioflavin t fluorescence and optical microscopy our experiments along with the analysis of scattered intensity distribution show that fibrillar aggregates grow following a thermally activated heterogeneous coagulation mechanism which includes both tip to tip elongation and lateral thickening also the association of fibrils into bundles and larger clusters up to tens of microns occurs simultaneously and is responsible for an effective lag time
