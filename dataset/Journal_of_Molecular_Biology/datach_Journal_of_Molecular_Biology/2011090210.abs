characterization of the endoribonuclease active site of human apurinic apyrimidinic endonuclease
apurinic apyrimidinic endonuclease  ape  is the major mammalian enzyme in dna base excision repair that cleaves the dna phosphodiester backbone immediately   to abasic sites recently we identified ape as an endoribonuclease that cleaves a specific coding region of c myc mrna in vitro regulating c myc mrna level and half life in cells here we further characterized the endoribonuclease activity of ape  focusing on the active site center of the enzyme previously defined for dna nuclease activities we found that most site directed ape mutant proteins n a d a y  f d  n f  a d  a and h  s  which target amino acid residues constituting the abasic dna endonuclease active site pocket showed significant decreases in endoribonuclease activity intriguingly the d  n ape mutant protein retained endoribonuclease and abasic single stranded rna cleavage activities with concurrent loss of apurinic apyrimidinic ap site cleavage activities on double stranded dna and single stranded dna ssdna  the mutant proteins bound c myc rna equally well as wild type wt ape  with the exception of h  n suggesting that most of these residues contributed primarily to rna catalysis and not to rna binding interestingly both the endoribonuclease and the ssrna ap site cleavage activities of wt ape were present in the absence of mg  while ssdna ap site cleavage required mg  optimally at      mm  we also found that a   oh on the sugar moiety was absolutely required for rna cleavage by wt ape  consistent with ape leaving a   po   group following cleavage of rna altogether our data support the notion that a common active site is shared for the endoribonuclease and other nuclease activities of ape  however we provide evidence that the mechanisms for cleaving rna abasic single stranded rna and abasic dna by ape are not identical an observation that has implications for unraveling the endoribonuclease function of ape in vivo
