hierarchical assembly of   microglobulin amyloid in vitro revealed by atomic force microscopy
the kinetics of spontaneous assembly of amyloid fibrils of wild type   microglobulin   m in vitro under acid conditions ph   and low ionic strength has been followed using thioflavin t tht binding in parallel experiments the morphology of the different fibrillar species present at different time points during the growth process were characterised using tapping mode atomic force microscopy tm afm in air and negative stain electron microscopy em  the thioflavin t assay shows a characteristic lag phase during which the nucleation of fibrils occurs before a rapid growth in fibril density the volume of fibrils deposited on mica measured from tm afm images at each time point correlates well with the fluorescence data tm afm and negative stain em revealed the presence of various kinds of protein aggregates in the lag phase that disappear concomitantly with a rise in the density of amyloid fibrils suggesting that these aggregates precede fibril growth and may act as nucleation sites three distinct morphologies of mature amyloid fibrils were observed within a single growth experiment as observed previously for the wild type protein and the variant n d additional supercoiled morphologies of the lower order fibrils were observed comparative height analysis from the tm afm data allows each of the mature fibril types and single protofilaments to be identified unambiguously and reveals that the assembly occurs via a hierarchy of morphological states
