domain organization of the monomeric form of the tom  mitochondrial import receptor
tom  is a mitochondrial protein import receptor composed of  tetratricopeptide repeats tprs  the first three tprs form an n terminal domain that recruits heat shock protein family chaperones while the eight c terminal tprs form a domain that receives from the bound chaperone mitochondrial precursor proteins destined for import analytical ultracentrifugation and solution small angle x ray scattering saxs analysis characterized tom  as an elongated monomer a model for the tom  monomer was proposed based on the alternate interpretation of the domain pairings observed in the crystal structure of the tom  dimer and refined against the saxs data in this  open  model of the tom  monomer the chaperone and precursor binding sites are exposed and lay side by side on one face of the molecule fluorescence anisotropy measurements indicated that monomeric tom  can bind both chaperone and precursor peptides and that chaperone peptide binding does not alter the affinity of tom  for the precursor peptide saxs was unable to detect any shape change in tom  upon chaperone binding however molecular modeling indicated that chaperone binding is incompatible with tom  dimer formation it is proposed that the tom  monomer is the functional unit mediating initial chaperone docking and precursor recognition
