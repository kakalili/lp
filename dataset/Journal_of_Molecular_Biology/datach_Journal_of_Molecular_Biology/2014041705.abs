energetic communication between functional sites of the gene  protein during infection by phage fd
to initiate infection of escherichia coli phage fd uses its gene  protein g p to bind first to an f pilus and then to the tola protein at the cell surface g p is normally auto inhibited because a tight interaction between the two n terminal domains n and n buries the tola binding site binding of n to the pilus activates g p by initiating long range conformational changes that are relayed to the domain interface and to a proline timer we discovered that the     loop of the n domain is critical for propagating these conformational signals the analysis of the stability and the folding dynamics of g p variants with a shortened loop combined with tola interaction studies and phage infection experiments reveal how the contact between the n domain and the     loop of n is energetically linked with the interdomain region and the proline timer and how it affects phage infectivity our results illustrate how conformational transitions and prolyl cis trans isomerization can be coupled energetically and how conformational signals to and from prolines can be propagated over long distances in proteins
