gene silencing by systemic delivery of synthetic sirnas in adult mice
in mammalian cells rna duplexes of     nucleotides known as small interfering rnas sirnas specifically inhibit gene expression in vitro here we show that systemic delivery of sirnas can inhibited exogenous and endogenous gene expression in adult mice cationic liposome based intravenous injection in mice of plasmid encoding the green fluorescent protein gfp with its cognate sirna inhibited gfp gene expression in various organs furthermore intraperitoneal injection of anti tnf  sirna inhibited lipopolysaccharide induced tnf  gene expression whereas secretion of il   was not inhibited importantly the development of sepsis in mice following a lethal dose of lipopolysaccharide injection was significantly inhibited by pre treatment of the animals with anti tnf  sirnas collectively these results demonstrate that synthetic sirnas can function in vivo as pharmaceutical drugs
