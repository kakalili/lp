the    crystal structure of the n terminal domain of an archaeal mcm as a right handed filament
mini chromosome maintenance mcm proteins are the replicative helicase necessary for dna replication in both eukarya and archaea most of archaea only have one mcm gene here we report a    crystal structure of the n terminal mcm from the archaeon thermoplasma acidophilum tapmcm  in the structure the mcm n terminus forms a right handed filament that contains six subunits in each turn with a diameter of   of the central channel opening the inner surface is highly positively charged indicating dna binding this filament structure with six subunits per turn may also suggests a potential role for an open ring structure for hexameric mcm and dynamic conformational changes in initiation and elongation stages of dna replication
