deletion analysis defines distinct functional domains for protein protein and nucleic acid interactions in the orf protein of mouse line  edited by j karn
line  or l  is a non ltr retrotransposon in mammals retrotransposition of l requires the action of two element encoded proteins orf p and orf p orf p provides essential enzymatic activities for the reverse transcription and integration of a newly transposed copy of l  whereas the exact role of orf p is less well understood the  kda orf p copurifies as a large complex with l rna in extracts of human and mouse cells mouse orf p purified from escherichia coli binds rna and single stranded dna in vitro exhibits nucleic acid chaperone activity and is capable of protein protein interaction in this study we create a series of deletions in the orf sequence express the truncated proteins and examine their activities to delineate the region of orf p responsible for these different functions by both yeast two hybrid analysis and gst pull down assay the protein protein interaction domain is defined as a coiled coil domain that encompasses about one third of the protein near its n terminus based on data obtained with uv cross linking electrophoretic mobility shift assay and an annealing assay the c terminal one third of orf p is both necessary and sufficient for nucleic acid binding and to promote annealing of complementary oligonucleotides separation of these activities into different domains of orf p will facilitate detailed biochemical analyses of the structure and function of this protein and understanding of its role during l retrotransposition
