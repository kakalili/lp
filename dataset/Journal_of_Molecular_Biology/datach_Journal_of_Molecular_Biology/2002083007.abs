the mechanism of transcriptional activation by the topologically dna linked sliding clamp of bacteriophage t
three viral proteins participate directly in transcription of bacteriophage t late genes the  family protein gp  provides promoter recognition gp  is the co activator and gp  is the activator of transcription gp  also represses transcription in the absence of gp  transcriptional activation by gp  the toroidal sliding clamp of the t dna polymerase holoenzyme requires assembly at primer  template junctions by its clamp loader the mechanism of transcriptional activation has been analyzed by examining rates of formation of open promoter complexes the basal gp  rna polymerase holoenzyme is only weakly held in its initially formed closed promoter complex which subsequently opens very slowly activation     fold in this work increases affinity in the closed complex and accelerates promoter opening promoter opening by gp  is also thermo irreversible the t late promoter does not open at  c but once opened at   c remains open upon shift to the lower temperature at a hybrid promoter for   and gp  holoenzymes only gp  confers thermo irreversibility of promoter opening interaction of gp  with a c terminal epitope of gp  is essential for the co activator function of gp
