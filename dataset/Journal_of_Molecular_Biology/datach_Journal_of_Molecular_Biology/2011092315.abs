unique utilization of a phosphoprotein phosphatase fold by a mammalian phosphodiesterase associated with wagr syndrome
metallophosphoesterase domain containing protein  mpped  is a highly evolutionarily conserved protein with orthologs found from worms to humans the human mpped gene is found in a region of chromosome  that is deleted in patients with wagr wilms tumor aniridia genitourinary anomalies and mental retardation syndrome and mpped may function as a tumor suppressor however the precise cellular roles of mpped are unknown and its low phosphodiesterase activity suggests that substrate hydrolysis may not be its prime function we present here the structures of mpped and two mutants which show that the poor activity of mpped is not only a consequence of the substitution of an active site histidine residue by glycine but also due to binding of amp or gmp to the active site this feature enhanced by structural elements of the protein allows mpped to utilize the conserved phosphoprotein phosphatase like fold in a unique manner ensuring that its enzymatic activity can be combined with a possible role as a scaffolding or adaptor protein
