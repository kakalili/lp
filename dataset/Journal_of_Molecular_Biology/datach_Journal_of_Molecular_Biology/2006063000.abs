probing the structural basis for the difference in thermostability displayed by family  xylanases
thermostability is an important property of industrially significant hydrolytic enzymes understanding the structural basis for this attribute will underpin the future biotechnological exploitation of these biocatalysts the cellvibrio family   gh  xylanases display considerable sequence identity but exhibit significant differences in thermostability thus these enzymes represent excellent models to examine the structural basis for the variation in stability displayed by these glycoside hydrolases here we have subjected the intracellular cellvibrio mixtus xylanase cmxyn b to forced protein evolution error prone pcr and selection identified a double mutant a  v g  d which confers an increase in thermostability the mutant has a tm   c higher than the wild type enzyme and at    c the first order rate constant for thermal inactivation of a  v g  d is       min   compared to a value of       min   for the wild type enzyme the introduction of the n to c terminal disulphide bridge into a  v g  d which increases the thermostability of wild type cmxyn b conferred a further    c increase in the tm of the double mutant the crystal structure of a  v g  d showed that the introduction of val  fills a cavity within the hydrophobic core of the xylanase increasing the number of van der waals interactions with the surrounding aromatic residues while o  of asp  makes an additional hydrogen bond with the amide of gly  and o  interacts with the arabinofuranose side chain of the xylose moiety at the   subsite to investigate the importance of xylan decorations in productive substrate binding the activity of wild type cmxyn b the mutant a  v g  d and several other gh  xylanases against xylotriose and xylotriose containing an arabinofuranose side chain ax  was assessed the enzymes were more active against ax than xylotriose providing evidence that the arabinose side chain makes a generic contribution to substrate recognition by gh  xylanases
