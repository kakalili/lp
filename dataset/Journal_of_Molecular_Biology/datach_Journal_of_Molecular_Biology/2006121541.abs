a conserved base pair between trna and   s rrna in the peptidyl transferase center is important for peptide release
the   terminus of trnas has the universally conserved bases c c a  that interact with the ribosomal large subunit in the ribosomal p site bases c  and c  of trna form watson  crick base pairs with g   and g   respectively present in the conserved p loop of   s rrna previous studies have suggested that the g   c  base pair is important for peptide bond formation using a pure population of mutant ribosomes we analyzed the precise role of this base pair in peptide bond formation elongation factor g dependent translocation and peptide release by release factor  surprisingly our results show that the g   c  base pair is not essential for peptide bond formation with intact aminoacyl trnas as substrates and for ef g catalyzed translocation interestingly however peptide release was reduced substantially when base pair formation between g   and c  of p site trna was disrupted indicating that this conserved base pair plays an important role in ester bond hydrolysis during translation termination
