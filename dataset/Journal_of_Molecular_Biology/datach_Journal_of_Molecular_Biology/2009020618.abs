crystal structure and functional analysis of the protein disulfide isomerase related protein erp
the protein disulfide isomerase related protein erp  is a putative chaperone involved in processing and secretion of secretory proteins until now however both the structure and the exact nature of interacting substrates remained unclear we provide for the first time a crystal structure of human erp  refined to     and show that the protein has considerable structural homology to its drosophila homolog wind we show that erp  binds directly not only to thyroglobulin and thyroglobulin derived peptides in vitro but also to the wind client protein pipe and pipe derived peptides although it fails to process pipe in vivo a monomeric mutant of erp  and a d domain mutant in which the second peptide binding site is inactivated also bind protein substrates indicating that the monomeric thioredoxin domain is sufficient for client protein binding indeed the b domains of erp  or wind expressed alone are sufficient for binding proteins and peptides interacting peptides have in common two or more aromatic residues with stronger binding for sequences with overall basic character thus the data allow a view of the two putative peptide binding sites of erp  and indicate that the apparent different processing activity of the human and drosophila proteins in vivo does not stem from differences in peptide binding properties
