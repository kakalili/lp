structure  function studies of a melanocarpus albomyces laccase suggest a pathway for oxidation of phenolic compounds
melanocarpus albomyces laccase crystals were soaked with   dimethoxyphenol a common laccase substrate three complex structures from different soaking times were solved crystal structures revealed the binding of the original substrate and adducts formed by enzymatic oxidation of the substrate the dimeric oxidation products were identified by mass spectrometry in the crystals a   dimethoxy p benzoquinone and a c  o dimer were observed whereas a c  c dimer was the main product identified by mass spectrometry crystal structures demonstrated that the substrate and or its oxidation products were bound in the pocket formed by residues ala   pro   glu   leu   phe   trp   phe   leu   trp  and his   substrate and adducts were hydrogen bonded to his   one of the ligands of type  copper therefore this surface exposed histidine most likely has a role in electron transfer by laccases based on our mutagenesis studies the carboxylic acid residue glu  at the bottom of the binding site pocket is also crucial in the oxidation of phenolics glu  may be responsible for the abstraction of a proton from the oh group of the substrate and his  may extract an electron in addition crystal structures revealed a secondary binding site formed through weak dimerization in m albomyces laccase molecules this binding site most likely exists only in crystals when the phe  residues are packed against each other
