catalase peroxidase katg of burkholderia pseudomallei at    resolution
the catalase peroxidase encoded by katg of burkholderia pseudomallei bpkatg is   identical with katg of mycobacterium tuberculosis the enzyme responsible for the activation of isoniazid as an antibiotic the structure of a complex of bpkatg with an unidentified ligand has been solved and refined at    resolution using x ray synchrotron data collected from crystals flash cooled with liquid nitrogen the crystallographic agreement factors r and rfree are    and    respectively the crystallized enzyme is a dimer with one modified heme group and one metal ion likely sodium per subunit the modification on the heme group involves the covalent addition of two or three atoms likely a perhydroxy group to the secondary carbon atom of the vinyl group on ring i the added group can form hydrogen bonds with two water molecules that are also in contact with the active site residues trp  and his   suggesting that the modification may have a catalytic role the heme modification is in close proximity to an unusual covalent adduct among the side chains of trp   tyr  and met   in addition trp  appears to be oxidized on c  of the indole ring the main channel providing access of substrate hydrogen peroxide to the heme contains a region of unassigned electron density consistent with the binding of a pyridine nucleotide like molecule an interior cavity containing the sodium ion and an additional region of unassigned density is evident adjacent to the adduct and is accessible to the outside through a second funnel shaped channel a large cleft in the side of the subunit is evident and may be a potential substrate binding site with a clear pathway for electron transfer to the active site heme group through the adduct
