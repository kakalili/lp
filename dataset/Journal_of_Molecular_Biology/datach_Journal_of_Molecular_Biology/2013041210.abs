allosteric inhibition of a zinc sensing transcriptional repressor insights into the arsenic repressor arsr family
the molecular basis of allosteric regulation remains a subject of intense interest staphylococcus aureus czra is a member of the ubiquitous arsenic repressor arsr family of bacterial homodimeric metal sensing proteins and has emerged as a model system for understanding allosteric regulation of operator dna binding by transition metal ions using unnatural amino acid substitution and a standard linkage analysis we show that a his   nh      o c his  quaternary structural hydrogen bond is an energetically significant contributor to the magnitude of the allosteric coupling free energy   gc a  cavity  introduced just beneath this hydrogen bond in v a l v czra results in a significant reduction in regulation by zn ii despite adopting a wild type global structure and zn ii binding and dna binding affinities only minimally affected from wild type the energetics of zn ii binding and heterotropic coupling free energies   hc   t  sc of the double mutant are also radically altered and suggest that increased internal dynamics leads to poorer allosteric negative regulation in v a l v czra a statistical coupling analysis of   arsr proteins reveals a sector that links the dna binding determinants and the   zn ii sensing sites through v  l  in czra we propose that distinct regulatory sites uniquely characteristic of individual arsr proteins result from evolution of distinct connectivities to this sector each capable of driving the same biological outcome transcriptional derepression
