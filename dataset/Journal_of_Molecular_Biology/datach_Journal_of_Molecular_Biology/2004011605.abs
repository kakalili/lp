mycobacterium tuberculosis ribose  phosphate isomerase has a known fold but a novel active site
ribose  phosphate isomerases ec     inter convert ribose  phosphate and ribulose  phosphate this reaction allows the synthesis of ribose from other sugars as well a means for salvage of carbohydrates after nucleotide breakdown two unrelated types of enzyme are known to catalyze the isomerization the most common one rpia is present in almost all organisms the second type rpib is found in many bacterial species here we demonstrate that the rpib from mycobacterium tuberculosis rv  c has catalytic properties very similar to those previously reported for the escherichia coli rpib enzyme further we report the structure of the mycobacterial enzyme solved by molecular replacement and refined to    resolution comparison with the e coli structure shows that there are important differences in the two active sites including a change in the position and nature of the catalytic base sequence comparisons reveal that the m tuberculosis and e coli rpib enzymes are in fact representative of two distinct sub families the mycobacterial enzyme represents a type found only in actinobacteria while the enzyme from e coli is typical of that seen in many other bacterial proteomes both rpibs are very different from rpia in structure as well as in the construction of the active site docking studies allow additional insights into the reactions of all three enzymes and show that many features of the mechanism are preserved despite the different catalytic components
