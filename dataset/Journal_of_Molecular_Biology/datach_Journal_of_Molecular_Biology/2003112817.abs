single cell analysis of  immunity regulation
we have examined expression of the  ci operon in single cells via a rex  gfp substitution although average fluorescence agreed with expectations for expression of  repressor fluorescence fluctuated greatly from cell to cell fluctuations in repressor concentration are not predicted by previous models and are tolerated in part by a regulatory response to dna damage
