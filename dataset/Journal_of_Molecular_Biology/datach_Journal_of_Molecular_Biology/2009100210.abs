amino acid insertion reveals a necessary three helical intermediate in the folding pathway of the colicin e immunity protein im
the small   residue   helical protein im  an inhibitor protein for colicin e that provides immunity to cells producing colicin e  folds via a three state mechanism involving an on pathway intermediate this kinetic intermediate contains three of four native helices that are oriented in a non native manner so as to minimise exposed hydrophobic surface area at this point in folding the short  residue helix iii has been shown to be unstructured in the intermediate ensemble and does not dock onto the developing hydrophobic core until after the rate limiting transition state has been traversed after helix iii has docked it adopts an  helical secondary structure and the side chains of residues within this region provide contacts that are crucial to native state stability in order to probe further the role of helix iii in the folding mechanism of im  we created a variant that contains an eight amino acid polyalanine like helix stabilised by a glu arg salt bridge and an asn pro gly capping motif juxtaposed c terminal to the natural  residue helix iii the effect of this insertion on the structure of the native protein and its folding mechanism were studied using nmr and  value analysis respectively the results reveal a robust native structure that is not perturbed by the presence of the extended helix iii mutational analysis performed to probe the folding mechanism of the redesigned protein revealed a conserved mechanism involving the canonical three helical intermediate the results suggest that folding via a three helical species stabilised by both native and non native interactions is an essential feature of im folding independent of the helical propensity of helix iii
