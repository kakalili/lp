contractions and expansions of cag ctg trinucleotide repeats occur during ectopic gene conversion in yeast by a mus  independent mechanism
cag ctg trinucleotide repeat tracts expand and contract at a high rate during gene conversion in saccharomyces cerevisiae in order to characterize the mechanism responsible for such rearrangements we built an experimental system based on the use of the rare cutter endonuclease i  scei to study the fate of trinucleotide repeat tracts during meiotic or mitotic allelic or ectopic gene conversion after double strand break dsb induced meiotic recombination  cag  and cag   are rearranged in  and   of the gene conversions respectively with similar proportions of contractions and expansions no evidence of a meiotic hot spot activity associated with trinucleotide repeats could be found when gene conversion is induced by a dsb during mitotic growth of the cells no rearrangement of the repeat tracts is detected when the donor sequence is allelic to the recipient site of the dsb however when the donor sequence is at an ectopic location frequent contractions and expansions of the repeat tract are found no crossing over associated with gene conversion could be detected mutants for the mus  gene involved in the resolution of recombination intermediates show a frequency of rearrangements identical with that of the wild type strain we concluded that trinucleotide repeat rearrangements occur frequently during ectopic but not during allelic recombination by a mechanism that does not require crossover formation
