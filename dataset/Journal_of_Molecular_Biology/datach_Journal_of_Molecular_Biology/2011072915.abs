identification of critical motifs within hiv  integrase required for importin   interaction and viral cdna nuclear import
the viral cdna nuclear import is an important requirement for human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  replication in dividing and nondividing cells our recent study identified a specific interaction of importin   imp   with hiv  integrase in and its involvement in viral cdna nuclear import in this study we have performed a more detailed investigation on the molecular mechanism of how hiv  in interacts with imp   our results revealed a reduced interaction between the two in mutants inkk   aa in    and inrk   aa in    with imp   while an in double mutant in       was severely impaired for its imp  binding ability even though it was still found interacting with other cofactors in interactor i and transportin  immunostaining and fractionation analysis have shown that yfp in      failed to localize in the nucleus of transfected cells also we found that both major and minor nuclear localization signal binding grooves of imp  are involved in interaction with in all of these results suggest a cargo protein  import receptor type of interaction finally the effect of in      mutations on hiv  replication was evaluated and real time quantitative pcr analysis showed that while mutant virus v       had a slightly lowered total viral dna the  long terminal repeat dna a marker for nuclear import was greatly reduced during v      infection in both dividing and nondividing cells also by cell fractionation assay we found that a significant proportion of viral cdna was still retained in cytoplasmic fraction of v      infected cells overall our study provides strong evidence that  kelqkqitk and  rrkak regions of in c terminal domain are required for imp  interaction and hiv  cdna nuclear import
