structural and functional mechanisms of crac channel regulation
in many animal cells stimulation of cell surface receptors coupled to g proteins or tyrosine kinases mobilizes ca  influx through store operated ca  release activated ca  crac channels the ensuing ca  entry regulates a wide variety of effector cell responses including transcription motility and proliferation the physiological importance of crac channels for human health is underscored by studies indicating that mutations in crac channel genes produce a spectrum of devastating diseases including chronic inflammation muscle weakness and a severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome moreover from a basic science perspective crac channels exhibit a unique biophysical fingerprint characterized by exquisite ca  selectivity store operated gating and distinct pore properties and therefore serve as fascinating model ion channels for understanding the biophysical mechanisms of ca  selectivity and channel opening studies in the last two decades have revealed the cellular and molecular choreography of the crac channel activation process and it is now established that opening of crac channels is governed through direct interactions between the pore forming orai proteins and the endoplasmic reticulum ca  sensors stim and stim  in this review we summarize the functional and structural mechanisms of crac channel regulation focusing on recent advances in our understanding of the conformational and structural dynamics of crac channel gating
