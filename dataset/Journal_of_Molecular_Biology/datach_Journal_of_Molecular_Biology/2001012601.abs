molecular dynamics simulation reveals conformational switching of water mediated uracil cytosine base pairs in an rna duplex edited by i tinoco
a  ns molecular dynamics simulation of an rna duplex r ggacuucggucc in solution with na and cl  as counterions was performed the x ray structure of this duplex includes two water mediated uracil cytosine pairs in contrast to the other base pairs in the duplex the water mediated pairs switch between different conformations one conformation corresponds to the geometry of the water mediated uc pairs in the duplex x ray structure with water acting both as hydrogen bond donor and acceptor another conformation is close to that of a water mediated uc base pair found in the x ray structure of the  s rrna sarcin ricin domain in this case the oxygen of the water molecule is linked to two base donor sites for a very short time also a direct uc base pair and a further conformation that is similar to the one found in the rna duplex structure but exhibits an increased h u  n c distance is observed water molecules with unusually long residence times are involved in the water mediated conformations these results indicate that the dynamic behaviour of the water mediated uc base pairs differs from that of the duplex watson crick and non canonical guanine uracil pairs with two or three direct hydrogen bonds the conformational variability and increased flexibility has to be taken into account when considering these base pairs as rna building blocks and as recognition motifs
