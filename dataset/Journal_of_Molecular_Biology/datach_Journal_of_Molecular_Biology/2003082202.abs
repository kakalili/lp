different genome maintenance strategies in human and tobacco cells
in this work genome maintenance strategies of organisms belonging to different kingdoms animals versus plants but of similar genome size were investigated using a novel universal double strand break dsb repair assay different plasmids linearised with kpni acc i or ecorv yielding either   or   protruding or blunt dna termini respectively were transfected into hela cells and nicotiana plumbaginifolia protoplasts and assayed for the efficiency and fidelity of dsb repair we show that the mechanism of break sealing is similar but that drastic differences are seen in the fidelity of repair in hela cells      dsbs were repaired precisely compared to as little as     in tobacco cells moreover the dsb repair in plants resulted in     longer deletions and significantly shorter insertions combined these led to more than twofold larger net dna loss in tobacco cells our observations point to possible differences in the strategies of dsb repair and genome maintenance in plants and animals
