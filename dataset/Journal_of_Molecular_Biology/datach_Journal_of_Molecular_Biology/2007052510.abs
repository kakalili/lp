diversity of structural behavior in vertebrate conventional myosins complexed with actin
low resolution three dimensional structures of acto myosin subfragment  s  complexes were retrieved from x ray fiber diffraction patterns recorded either in the presence or absence of adp the s was obtained from various myosin ii isoforms from vertebrates including rabbit fast skeletal and cardiac chicken smooth and human non muscle iia and iib species and was diffused into an array of overstretched skinned skeletal muscle fibers the s attached to the exposed actin filaments according to their helical symmetry upon addition of adp the diffraction patterns from acto  s showed an increasing magnitude of response in the order as listed above with features of a lateral compression of the whole diffraction pattern indicative of increased radius of the acto  s complex and an enhancement of the fifth layer line reflection the structure retrieval indicates that these changes are mainly due to the swing of the light chain lc domain in the direction consistent with the cryo electron microscopic results in the non muscle isoforms the swing is large enough to affect the manner of quasi crystal packing of the s decorated actin filaments and their lattice dimension with a small change in the twist of actin filaments variations also exist in the behavior of the  k cleft which apparently opens upon addition of adp to the non muscle isoforms but not to other isoforms the fast skeletal s remains as the only isoform that does not clearly exhibit either of the structural changes the results indicate that the  conventional  myosin ii isoforms exhibit a wide variety of structural behavior possibly depending on their functions and or the history of molecular evolution
