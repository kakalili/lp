canonical structures for the hypervariable regions of t cell   receptors edited by j m thornton
t cell   receptors have binding sites for peptide mhc complexes formed by six hypervariable regions analysis of the six atomic structures known for v  and for v  domains shows that their first and second hypervariable regions have one of three or four different main chain conformations canonical structures  six of these canonical structures have the same conformation in complexes with peptide mhc complexes the free receptor and or in an isolated v domain thus for at least the first and second hypervariable regions in the currently known structures the conformation of the canonical structures is well defined in the free state and is conserved on formation of complexes with peptide mhc we identified the key residues that are mainly responsible for the conformation of each canonical structure the first and second hypervariable regions of v  and v  domains are encoded by the germline v segments humans have  functional v  segments and  v  segments and mice have  v  segments inspection of the size of their hypervariable regions and of sites that contain key residues indicates that close to   of v  segments and   of v  segments have hypervariable regions with a conformation of one of the known canonical structures the  and  v gene segments in both humans and mice have only a few combinations of different canonical structure in their first and second hypervariable regions in human v  domains the number of different sequences with these canonical structure combinations is larger than in mice whilst for v  domains it is probably smaller
