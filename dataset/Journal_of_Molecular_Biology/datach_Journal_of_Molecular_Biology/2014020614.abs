insights into eukaryotic primer synthesis from structures of the p  subunit of human dna primase
dna replication in all organisms requires polymerases to synthesize copies of the genome dna polymerases are unable to function on a bare template and require a primer primases are crucial rna polymerases that perform the initial de novo synthesis generating the first    nucleotides of the primer although structures of archaeal and bacterial primases have provided insights into general priming mechanisms these proteins are not well conserved with heterodimeric p  p  primases in eukaryotes here we present x ray crystal structures of the catalytic engine of a eukaryotic primase which is contained in the p  subunit the structures of p  reveal that eukaryotic primases maintain the conserved catalytic prim fold domain but with a unique subdomain not found in the archaeal and bacterial primases calorimetry experiments reveal that mn  but not mg  significantly enhances the binding of nucleotide to primase which correlates with higher catalytic efficiency in vitro the structure of p  with bound utp and mn  provides insights into the mechanism of nucleotide synthesis by primase substitution of conserved residues involved in either metal or nucleotide binding alter nucleotide binding affinities and yeast strains containing the corresponding pri p substitutions are not viable our results reveal that two residues s  and h   in direct contact with the nucleotide were previously unrecognized as critical to the human primase active site comparing p  structures to those of similar polymerases in different states of action suggests changes that would be required to attain a catalytically competent conformation capable of initiating dinucleotide synthesis
