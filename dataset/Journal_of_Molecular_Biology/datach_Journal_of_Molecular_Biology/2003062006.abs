mechanism of dna binding by the adr zinc finger transcription factor as determined by spr
the adr protein recognizes a six base pair consensus dna sequence using two zinc fingers and an adjacent accessory motif kinetic measurements were performed on the dna binding domain of adr using surface plasmon resonance binding by adr was characterized to two known native binding sequences from the adh and cta promoter regions which differ in two of the six consensus positions in addition non specific binding by adr to a random dna sequence was measured adr binds the native sites with nanomolar affinities remarkably adr binds non specific dna with affinities only approximately tenfold lower than the native sequences the specific and non specific binding affinities are conferred mainly by differences in the association phase of dna binding the association rate for the complex is strongly influenced by the proximal accessory region while the dissociation reaction and specificity of binding are controlled by the two zinc fingers binding kinetics of two adr mutants was also examined adr containing an r k mutation in the accessory region bound with similar affinity to wild type but with slightly less sequence specificity the r k mutation was observed to increase binding affinity to a suboptimal sequence by decreasing the complex dissociation rate l  h a change of specificity mutation at the  position of the second zinc finger bound its preferred sequence with a slightly higher affinity than wild type the l  h mutant indicates that beneficial protein  dna contacts provide similar levels of stabilization to the complex whether they are hydrogen bonding or van der waals interactions
