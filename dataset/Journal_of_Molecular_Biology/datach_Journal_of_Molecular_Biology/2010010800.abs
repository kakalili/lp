engineered cystine knot miniproteins as potent inhibitors of human mast cell tryptase
here we report the design chemical and recombinant synthesis and functional properties of a series of novel inhibitors of human mast cell tryptase   a protease of considerable interest as a therapeutic target for the treatment of allergic asthma and inflammatory disorders these inhibitors are derived from a linear variant of the cyclic cystine knot miniprotein mcoti ii originally isolated from the seeds of momordica cochinchinensis a synthetic cyclic miniprotein that bears additional positive charge in the loop connecting the n and c termini inhibits all monomers of the tryptase  tetramer with an overall equilibrium dissociation constant ki of  nm and thus is one of the most potent proteinaceous inhibitors of tryptase  described to date these cystine knot miniproteins may therefore become valuable scaffolds for the design of a new generation of tryptase inhibitors
