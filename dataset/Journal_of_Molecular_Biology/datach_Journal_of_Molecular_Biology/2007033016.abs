fully reduced ribonuclease a does not expand at high denaturant concentration or temperature
the dimensions of a denatured protein fully reduced ribonuclease a r rnase a  have been measured using synchrotron based small angle x ray scattering the radius of gyration        is unchanged from    m guanidinium chloride and from      c at ph   and agrees with the known scaling behavior for a multitude of chemically denatured states the polypeptide is behaving as a statistical coil in the non interacting high temperature limit
