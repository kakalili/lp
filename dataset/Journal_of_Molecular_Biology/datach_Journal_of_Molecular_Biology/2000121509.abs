multiple disordered loops function in corepressor induced dimerization of the biotin repressor
cooperative association of the escherichia coli biotin repressor with the biotin operator is allosterically activated by binding of the corepressor bio   amp the corepressor function of the adenylate is due in part to its ability to induce repressor dimerization since a high resolution structure of only the apo or unliganded repressor is currently available the location of the dimerization interface on the protein structure is not known here five mutants in the corepressor binding domain of the repressor have been analyzed with respect to their dna binding and self assembly properties results of these studies reveal that four of the mutant proteins exhibit defects in dna binding these same proteins are compromised in self assembly furthermore in the three dimensional structure of the apo protein the mutations all lie in partially disordered surface loops one of which is known to participate directly in corepressor binding these results suggest that multiple disordered surface loops function in the corepressor induced dimerization required for sequence specific dna binding by the biotin repressor
