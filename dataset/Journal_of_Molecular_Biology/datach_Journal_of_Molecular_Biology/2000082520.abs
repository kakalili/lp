membrane induced conformational change during the activation of hiv  gp  edited by a r fersht
the human immunodeficiency virus type  gp  ectodomain forms a three hairpin protease resistant core in the absence of membranes namely the putative gp  fusion active state here we show that recombinant proteins corresponding to the ectodomain of gp  but lacking the fusion peptide bind membranes and consequently undergo a major conformational change as a result the protease resistant core becomes susceptible to proteolytic digestion accordingly synthetic peptides corresponding to the segments that construct this core bind the membrane it is remarkable that the hetero oligomer formed by these peptides dissociates upon binding to the membrane these results are consistent with a model in which after the three hairpin conformation is formed membrane binding induces opening of the gp  core complex we speculate that binding of the segments that constructed the core to the viral and cellular membranes could bring the membranes closer together and facilitate their merging
