the four hydrophobic residues on the hsp  inter domain linker have two distinct roles
the ubiquitous molecular chaperone  kda heat shock proteins hsp  play key roles in maintaining protein homeostasis hsp s contain two functional domains a nucleotide binding domain and a substrate binding domain the two domains are connected by a highly conserved inter domain linker and allosteric coupling between the two domains is critical for chaperone function the auxiliary chaperone  kda heat shock proteins hsp  facilitate all the biological processes associated with hsp s by stimulating the atpase activity of hsp s although an overall essential role of the inter domain linker in both allosteric coupling and hsp  interaction has been suggested the molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown previously we reported a crystal structure of a full length hsp  homolog in which the inter domain linker forms a well ordered  strand four highly conserved hydrophobic residues reside on the inter domain linker in dnak a well studied hsp  these residues are v   l   l   and l   in this study we biochemically dissected their roles the inward facing side chains of v  and l  form extensive hydrophobic contacts with the nucleotide binding domain suggesting their essential roles in coupling the two functional domains a hypothesis confirmed by mutational analysis on the other hand l  and l  face outward on the surface mutation of either abolishes dnak s in vivo function yet intrinsic biochemical properties remain largely intact in contrast hsp  interaction is severely compromised thus for the first time we separated the two essential roles of the highly conserved hsp  inter domain linker coupling the two functional domains through v  and l  and mediating the interaction with hsp  through l  and l
