atypical binding of the swa p uba domain to ubiquitin
swa p is an auxilin like yeast protein that is involved in vesicular transport and required for uncoating of clathrin coated vesicles swa p contains a ubiquitin associated uba domain which is present in a variety of proteins involved in ubiquitin ub mediated processes we have determined a structural model of the swa p uba domain in complex with ub using nmr spectroscopy and molecular docking ub recognition occurs predominantly through an atypical interaction in which uba helix   and the n terminal part of helix   bind to ub mutation of ala   a key residue in helix   to polar residues greatly reduced the affinity of the uba domain for ub and revealed a second low affinity ub binding site located on the surface formed by helices   and   surface plasmon resonance showed that the swa p uba domain binds k  and k  linked di ub in a non linkage specific manner these results reveal convergent evolution of a ub binding site on helix   of uba domains involved in membrane protein trafficking
