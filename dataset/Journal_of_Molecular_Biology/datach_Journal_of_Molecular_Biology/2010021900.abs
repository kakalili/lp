cation selective pathway of ompf porin revealed by anomalous x ray diffraction
the ompf porin from the escherichia coli outer membrane folds into a trimer of  barrels each forming a wide aqueous pore allowing the passage of ions and small solutes a long loop l  carrying multiple acidic residues folds into the  barrel pore to form a narrow  constriction zone   a strong and highly conserved charge asymmetry is observed at the constriction zone with multiple basic residues attached to the wall of the  barrel lys  arg  arg  and arg   on one side and multiple acidic residues of l  asp   asp   glu   asp   asp   asp   on the other side several computational studies have suggested that a strong transverse electric field could exist at the constriction zone as a result of such charge asymmetry giving rise to separate permeation pathways for cations and anions to examine this question ompf was expressed purified and crystallized in the p  space group and two different data sets were obtained at     and     resolution with k and rb  respectively the rb soaked crystals were collected at the rubidium anomalous wavelength of      and cation positions were determined a peg molecule was observed in the pore region for both the k and rb soaked crystals where it interacts with loop l  the results reveal the separate pathways of anions and cations across the constriction zone of the ompf pore
