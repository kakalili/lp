identification of a unique  stability control region  that controls protein stability of tropomyosin a two stranded  helical coiled coil
nine recombinant chicken skeletal  tropomyosin proteins were prepared eight c terminal deletion constructs and the full length protein                                   and    and characterized by circular dichroism spectroscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation we identified for the first time a stability control region between residues  and   fragments of tropomyosin lacking this region         and     still fold into two stranded  helical coiled coils but are significantly less stable tm between       c than longer fragments containing this region              and     which show a large increase in their thermal midpoints tm      c for a  tm of      c between    and     we further investigated two additional fragments that ended between residues  and   that is fragments     and     these fragments were more stable than    and less stable than     and showed that there were three separate sites that synergistically contribute to the large jump in protein stability electrostatic clusters     and      and a hydrophobic interaction from leu    all the residues involved in these stabilizing interactions are located outside the hydrophobic core a and d positions that have been shown to be the major contributor to coiled coil stability our results show clearly that protein stability is more complex than previously thought and unique sites can synergistically control protein stability over long distances
