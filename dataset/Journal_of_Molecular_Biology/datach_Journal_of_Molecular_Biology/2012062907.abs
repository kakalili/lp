a three dimensional fret analysis to construct an atomic model of the actin  tropomyosin  troponin core domain complex on a muscle thin filament
it is essential to know the detailed structure of the thin filament to understand the regulation mechanism of striated muscle contraction fluorescence resonance energy transfer fret was used to construct an atomic model of the actin  tropomyosin tm  troponin tn core domain complex we generated single cysteine mutants in the      region of tm and in tnc tni and the  tnt  kda fragment and each was attached with an energy donor probe an energy acceptor probe was located at actin gln  actin cys   or the actin nucleotide binding site from these donor  acceptor pairs fret efficiencies were determined with and without ca  using the atomic coordinates for f actin tm and the tn core domain we searched all possible arrangements for tm or the tn core domain on f actin to calculate the fret efficiency for each donor  acceptor pair in each arrangement by minimizing the squared sum of deviations for the calculated fret efficiencies from the observed fret efficiencies we determined the location of tm segment      and the tn core domain on f actin with and without ca  the bulk of the tn core domain is located near actin subdomains  and  the central helix of tnc is nearly perpendicular to the f actin axis directing the n terminal domain of tnc toward the actin outer domain the c terminal region in the i  t arm forms a four helix bundle structure with the tm      region after ca  release the tn core domain moves toward the actin outer domain and closer to the center of the f actin axis
