measurements of single dna molecule packaging dynamics in bacteriophage  reveal high forces high motor processivity and capsid transformations
molecular motors drive genome packaging into preformed procapsids in many double stranded ds dna viruses here we present optical tweezers measurements of single dna molecule packaging in bacteriophage   dna  gpa  gpnu complexes were assembled with recombinant gpa and gpnu proteins and tethered to microspheres and procapsids were attached to separate microspheres dna binding and initiation of packaging were observed within a few seconds of bringing these microspheres into proximity in the presence of atp the motor was observed to generate greater than  piconewtons pn of force in the same range as observed with bacteriophage    suggesting that high force generation is a common property of viral packaging motors however at low capsid filling the packaging rate averaged     bp s which is   fold higher than    and the motor processivity was also threefold higher with less than one slip per genome length translocated the packaging rate slowed significantly with increasing capsid filling indicating a buildup of internal force reaching  pn at   packaging in good agreement with the force driving dna ejection measured in osmotic pressure experiments and calculated theoretically taken together these experiments show that the internal force that builds during packaging is largely available to drive subsequent dna ejection in addition we observed an   bp s dip in the average packaging rate at   packaging suggesting that procapsid expansion occurs at this point following the buildup of an average of  pn of internal force in experiments with a dna construct longer than the wild type genome a sudden acceleration in packaging rate was observed above   packaging and much greater than   of the genome length was translocated suggesting that internal force can rupture the immature procapsid which lacks an accessory protein gpd
