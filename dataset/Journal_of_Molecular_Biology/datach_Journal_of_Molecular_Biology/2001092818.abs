high affinity cooperative dna binding by the yeast mlh pms heterodimer edited by m belfort
we demonstrate here that the saccharomyces cerevisiae mlh pms heterodimer required for dna mismatch repair and other cellular processes is a dna binding protein binding was evaluated using a variety of single and double stranded dna molecules mlh pms bound short substrates with low affinity and showed a slight preference for single stranded dna in contrast mlh pms exhibited a much higher affinity for long dna molecules suggesting that binding is cooperative high affinity binding required a duplex dna length greater than   base pairs the rate of association with dna was rapid and dissociation of protein dna complexes following extensive dilution was very slow however in competition experiments we observed a rapid active transfer of mlh pms from labeled to unlabeled dna binding was non sequence specific and highly sensitive to salt type and concentration suggesting that mlh pms primarily interacts with the dna backbone via ionic contacts cooperative binding was observed visually by atomic force microscopy as long continuous tracts of mlh pms protein bound to duplex dna these images also showed that mlh pms simultaneously interacts with two different regions of duplex dna taken together the atomic force microscope images and dna binding assays provide strong evidence that mlh pms binds duplex dna with positive cooperativity and that there is more than one dna binding site on the heterodimer these dna binding properties of mlh pms may be relevant to its participation in dna mismatch repair recombination and cellular responses to dna damage
