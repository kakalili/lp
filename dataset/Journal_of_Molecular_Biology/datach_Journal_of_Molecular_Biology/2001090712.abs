computer aided design of  sheet peptides edited by j thornton
the design of  sheet proteins is still a challenge in the field of de novo protein design here we have tested the validity of automatic design methods to create and or improve  sheet peptides and proteins we chose betanova a three stranded  sheet peptide as target system and as an automatic design tool a protein design algorithm called perla protein engineering rotamer library algorithm  perla was used to define both stabilising and destabilising single and multiple residue mutations of betanova conformational analysis by nmr spectroscopy and far uv circular dichroism cd allowed us to evaluate population differences among the set of designed peptides some of the new mutants are approximately  kcal mol more stable than the wild type peptide comparison of the scale of predicted and observed stabilities demonstrates that they are in good agreement for most peptides studied our results show that automatic design algorithms can be successfully applied to the design of  sheet peptides
