novel ubiquitin fusion proteins ribosomal protein p and actin
ubiquitin is a small highly conserved protein found in all eukaryotic cells through its covalent attachment to other proteins ubiquitin regulates numerous important cellular processes including apoptosis transcription and the progression of the cell cycle ubiquitin expression is unusual it is encoded and expressed as multimeric head to tail repeats polyubiquitins that are post translationally cleaved into monomers or fused with ribosomal proteins l  and s a the ubiquitin moiety is removed from these fusion proteins but is thought to act as a chaperone in ribosome biogenesis prior to cleavage here we show that the chlorarachniophyte algae express several novel ubiquitin fusion proteins an expressed sequence tag est survey revealed ubiquitin fusions with an unidentified open reading frame orf  ribosomal protein p and most interestingly actin actin is an essential component of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton and is involved in a variety of cellular processes in other eukaryotes actin genes only exist as stand alone orfs but in all chlorarachniophytes examined actin is always encoded as a ubiquitin fusion protein the variety of ubiquitin fusion proteins in these organisms raises interesting questions about the evolutionary origins of ubiquitin fusions as well as their possible biochemical functions in other processes such as cytoskeletal regulation
