heterologous prion interactions are altered by mutations in the prion protein rnq p
prions in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae show a surprising degree of interdependence specifically the rate of appearance of the psi  prion which is thought to be an important mechanism to respond to changing environmental conditions is greatly increased by another prion  rnq  while the domains of the rnq protein important for formation of the rnq  prion have been defined the specific residues required remain unknown furthermore residues in rnq p that mediate the interaction between psi  and rnq  are unknown to identify residues important for prion protein interactions we created a mutant library of rnq p clones in the context of a chimera that serves as proxy for rnq  aggregates several of the mutant rnq p proteins showed structural differences in the aggregates they formed as revealed by semi denaturing detergent agarose gel electrophoresis additionally several of the mutants showed a striking defect in the ability to promote psi  induction these data indicate that the mutants formed strain variants of rnq  by dissecting the mutations in the isolated clones we found five single mutations that caused psi  induction defects s  p f  s q  r n  s and q  r these are the first specific mutations characterized in rnq p that alter psi  induction additionally we have identified a region important for the propagation of certain strain variants of rnq  deletion of this region amino acids      affected propagation of the high variant but not medium or low rnq  strain variants furthermore when the low rnq  strain variant was propagated by        psi  induction was greatly increased these data suggest that this region is important in defining the structure of the rnq  strain variants these data are consistent with a model of psi  induction caused by physical interactions between rnq p and sup p
