crystal structures of protein phosphatase  bound to nodularin r and tautomycin a novel scaffold for structure based drug design of serine threonine phosphatase inhibitors
protein phosphatase  occurs in all tissues and regulates many pathways ranging from cell cycle progression to carbohydrate metabolism many naturally occurring molecular toxins modulate pp activity though the exact mechanism of this differential regulation is not understood a detailed elucidation of these interactions is crucial for understanding the cellular basis of phosphatase function and signaling pathways but more importantly they can serve as the basis for highly specific therapeutics e g against cancer we report the crystal structures of pp in complex with nodularin r at     and tautomycin at     resolution the pp nodularin r complex was used to demonstrate the utility of our improved pp production technique which produces highly active soluble pp  tautomycin is one of the few toxins that reportedly preferentially binds pp gt pp a therefore the pp tautomycin structure is the first complex structure with a toxin with preferred pp specificity furthermore since tautomycin is a linear non peptide based toxin our reported structure will aid the design of lead compounds for novel pp specific pharmaceuticals
