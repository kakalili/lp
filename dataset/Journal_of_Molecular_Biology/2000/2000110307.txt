The core of Escherichia coli tRNACys is important for aminoacylation of the tRNA by cysteine-tRNA synthetase. This core differs from the common tRNA core by having a G15:G48, rather than a G15:C48 base-pair. Substitution of G15:G48 with G15:C48 decreases the catalytic efficiency of aminoacylation by two orders of magnitude. This indicates that the design of the core is not compatible with G15:C48. However, the core of E. coli tRNAGln, which contains G15:C48, is functional for cysteine-tRNA synthetase. Here, guided by the core of E. coli tRNAGln, we sought to test and identify alternative functional design of the tRNACys core that contains G15:C48. Although analysis of the crystal structure of tRNACys and tRNAGln implicated long-range tertiary base-pairs above and below G15:G48 as important for a functional core, we showed that this was not the case. The replacement of tertiary interactions involving 9, 21, and 59 in tRNACys with those in tRNAGln did not construct a functional core that contained G15:C48. In contrast, substitution of nucleotides in the variable loop adjacent to 48 of the 15:48 base-pair created functional cores. Modeling studies of a functional core suggests that the re-constructed core arose from enhanced stacking interactions that compensated for the disruption caused by the G15:C48 base-pair. The repacked tRNA core displayed features that were distinct from those of the wild-type and provided evidence that stacking interactions are alternative means than long-range tertiary base-pairs to a functional core for aminoacylation.
