interactions of an arg rich region of transcription elongation protein nusa with nut rna implications for the order of assembly of the  n antitermination complex in vivo edited by m gottesman
the e coli nusa transcription elongation protein nusaec  identified because of its requirement for transcription antitermination by the n protein has an arg rich s rna binding domain a complex of n and nusa with other host factors binding at nut sites in the rna renders rna polymerase termination resistant an e coli haploid for nusa   having nine different codons replacing four normally found in the arg rich region is defective in support of n action another variant haploid for the nusar  a allele with a change in a highly conserved arg codon in the s domain effectively supports n mediated antitermination however nusar  a is recessive to nusa   while nusaec is dominant to nusa  for support of n mediated antitermination suggesting a competition between nusa  and nusar  a during complex formation complex formation with the variant nusa proteins was assessed by mobility gel shifts nusar  a unlike nusaec and nusa   fails to form a complex with n and nut rna however while nusar  a like wild type nusa forms an enlarged complex with nut rna n rna polymerase and other host proteins required for efficient n mediated antitermination nusa  does not form this enlarged complex consistent with the in vivo results nusa  prevents nusar  a but not nusaec from forming the enlarged complex the simplest conclusion from these dominance studies is that in the formation of the complete active antitermination complex in vivo nusa and n binding to the newly synthesized nut rna precedes addition of the other factors alternative less effective routes to the active complex that allows bypass of this preferred pathway may also exist
