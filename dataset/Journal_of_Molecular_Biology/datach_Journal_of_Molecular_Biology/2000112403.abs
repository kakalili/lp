the effect of the acidic tail on the dna binding properties of the hmg  class of proteins insights from tail switching and tail removal edited by t richmond
the high mobility group hmg proteins hmg  hmg and hmg a are relatively abundant vertebrate dna binding and bending proteins that bind with structure specificity rather than sequence specificity and appear to play an architectural role in the assembly of nucleoprotein complexes they have two homologous  hmg box  dna binding domains which show about   homology connected by a short basic linker to an acidic carboxy terminal tail that differs in length between hmg and  to gain insights into the role of the acidic tail we examined the dna binding properties of hmg  hmg b and hmg a from chicken erythrocytes corresponding to hmg  hmg and hmg a in other vertebrates  hmg  with the longest acidic tail is less effective than hmg a and b at a given molar input ratio in supercoiling relaxed closed circular dna in inducing ligase mediated circularisation of an  bp dna fragment and in binding to four way dna junctions in a gel shift assay removal of the acidic tail increases the affinity of the hmg boxes for dna and largely abolishes the differences between the three species switching the acidic tail of hmg for that of hmg a or b gives hybrid proteins with essentially the same dna binding properties as hmg a  b the length and possibly sequence of the acidic tail thus appears to be the dominant factor in mediating the differences in properties between hmg  a and b and finely tunes the rather similar dna binding properties of the tandem hmg boxes presumably to fulfill different cellular roles the tail is essential for structure selective dna binding of the hmg boxes to dna minicircles in the presence of equimolar linear dna and has little effect on the affinity for this already highly distorted dna ligand in contrast to binding to linear and four way junction dna
