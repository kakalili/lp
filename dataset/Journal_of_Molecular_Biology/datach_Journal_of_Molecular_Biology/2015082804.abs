a regulated ubiquitin independent degron in i b
whereas ubiquitin dependent degrons have been characterized in some detail how proteins may be targeted to ubiquitin independent proteasomal degradation remains unclear here we show that i b  contains an ubiquitin independent degron whose activity is portable to heterologous proteins such as the globular protein gfp green fluorescent protein via a proteasome dependent ubiquitin independent non lysosomal pathway the ubiquitin independent degradation signal resides in an  amino acid sequence which is not only sufficient but also required for i b  s short half life finally we show that this degron s activity is regulated by the interaction with nf b which controls its solvent exposure and we demonstrate that this regulation of the degron s activity is critical for i b  s signaling functions
