lattice structure of cytoplasmic microtubules in a cultured mammalian cell
tubulin can polymerize in two distinct arrangements   b lattices   in which the  tubulins of one protofilament lie next to  tubulins in the neighboring protofilaments or the  a  configuration where  tubulins lie beside  tubulins microtubules mts in flagellar axonemes and those assembled from pure tubulin in vitro display only b lattices but recent work shows that a lattices are found when tubulin co polymerizes in vitro with an allele of end binding protein  that lacks c terminal sequences this observation suggests that cytoplasmic mts which form in the presence of this  tip associating protein   may have a lattices to test this hypothesis we have decorated interphase mts in t cells with monomeric motor domains from the kinesin like protein eg  these mts show only b lattices as confirmed by visual inspection of electron cryo tomograms and power spectra of single projection views imaged at higher electron dose this result is significant because  protofilament mts with b lattices must include a  seam   one lateral domain where adjacent dimers are in the a configuration it follows that cytoplasmic mts are not cylindrically symmetric they have two distinct faces which may influence the binding patterns of functionally significant mt interacting proteins
