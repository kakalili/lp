a novel  nm protein cage formed by vibrio cholerae acylphosphatase
here we show the formation of an  nm cage formed by the self assembly of acylphosphatase from vibrio cholerae o   vc acp  the  subunit cage structure forms spontaneously and is stabilized through binding of sulfate ions at its exterior face and interfacial regions crystal structure and studies in solutions illuminate the basis for the formation of the cage while a single cys   arg mutation vc acp c r transforms vc acp to a potent enzyme but disrupts the assembly into a trimer
