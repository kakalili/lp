the thermodynamics of protein  protein recognition as characterized by a combination of volumetric and calorimetric techniques the binding of turkey ovomucoid third domain to  chymotrypsin
we have used ultrasonic velocimetry high precision densimetry and fluorescence spectroscopy in conjunction with isothermal titration and differential scanning calorimetry to characterize the binding of turkey ovomucoid third domain omtky  to  chymotrypsin we report the changes in volume and adiabatic compressibility that accompany the association of these proteins at   c and ph   in addition we report the changes in free energy enthalpy entropy and heat capacity upon the binding of omtky to  chymotrypsin over a temperature range of     c our volume and compressibility data in conjunction with x ray crytsallographic data on the omtky    chymotrypsin complex suggest that      water molecules are released to the bulk state upon the binding of omtky to  chymotrypsin furthermore these volumetric data suggest that the intrinsic compressibility of the two proteins decreases by   at each temperature studied omtky association with  chymotrypsin is entropy driven with a large unfavorable enthalpy contribution the observed entropy of the binding reflects interplay between two very large favorable and unfavorable terms the favorable term reflects an increase in the hydrational entropy resulting from release to the bulk of   water molecules the unfavorable term is related to a decrease in the configurational entropy and consequently a decrease in the conformational dynamics of the two proteins in general we discuss the relationship between macroscopic and microscopic properties in particular identifying and quantifying the role of hydration in determining the thermodynamics of protein recognition as reflected in volumetric and calorimetric parameters
