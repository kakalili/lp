ligand entry and exit pathways in the   adrenergic receptor
the recently determined crystal structure of the human   adrenergic   ar g protein coupled receptor provides an excellent structural basis for exploring  ar  ligand binding and dissociation process based on this crystal structure we simulated ligand exit from the  ar receptor by applying the random acceleration molecular dynamics ramd simulation method the simulation results showed that the extracellular opening on the receptor surface was the most frequently observed egress point referred to as pathway a  and a few other pathways through interhelical clefts were also observed with significantly lower frequencies in the egress trajectories along pathway a the d   k  salt bridge between the extracellular loop  ecl  and the apex of the transmembrane helix  tm  was exclusively broken the spatial occupancy maps of the ligand computed from the   ramd simulation trajectories indicated that the receptor  ligand interactions that restrained the ligand in the binding pocket were the major resistance encountered by the ligand during exit and no second barrier was notable we next performed ramd simulations by using a putative ligand free conformation of the receptor as input structure this conformation was obtained in a standard molecular dynamics simulation in the absence of the ligand and it differed from the ligand bound conformation in a hydrophobic patch bridging ecl and tm due to the rotation of f  of ecl  results from the ramd simulations with this putative ligand free conformation suggest that the cleft formed by the hydrophobic bridge tm  tm  and tm on the extracellular surface likely serves as a more specific ligand entry site and the ecl  tm hydrophobic junction can be partially interrupted upon the entry of ligand that pushes f  to rotate resulting in a conformation as observed in the ligand bound crystal structure these results may help in the design of  ar targeting drugs with improved efficacy as well as in understanding the receptor subtype selectivity of ligand binding in the  family of the adrenergic receptors that share almost identical ligand binding pockets but show notable amino acid sequence divergence in the putative ligand entry site including ecl and the extracellular end of tm
