antirestriction protein ard type c encoded by incw plasmid psa has a high similarity to the  protein transport  domain of trac primase of promiscuous plasmid rp  edited by m gottesman
the incw plasmid psa contains the gene ard encoding an antirestriction function that is specific for type i restriction and modification systems the nucleotide sequence of ard was determined and an appropriate polypeptide of about  kda was identified in escherichia coli t expression system analysis of deduced amino acid sequence of ard encoded by psa revealed that this protein has no significant similarities with the known ard proteins arda and ardb types except the  antirestriction  motif   amino acid residues in length conserved for all known ard proteins this finding suggests that psa ard may be classified as a new type of ard proteins which we designated ardc the remarkable feature of ardc is that it has a high degree of similarity about   identity to the n terminal region of rp trac primase which includes about   amino acid residues and seems to be essential for binding to the single stranded dna and trac protein transport to the recipient cells during the conjugal transfer of plasmid dna ardc also binds to single stranded dna in addition this protein is able in vitro to protect the single stranded but not double stranded plasmid dna against the activity of type ii restriction endonuclease hhai that cleaves both single and double stranded dna we suggest that like trac  ardc would be transported as a result of their interaction with the single stranded dna of transferred plasmid strand during conjugative passage through the cell envelope to the recipient bacterium such properties of ardc protein might be useful to protect immediately the incoming single stranded dna from the host endonucleases
