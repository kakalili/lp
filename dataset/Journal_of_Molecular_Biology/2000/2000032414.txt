The interaction of collagen IV with cells is mediated mainly by the integrin α1β1. The recognition site has been located to a segment of the triple-helical domain 100 nm away from the N terminus of the collagen molecule. The three essential amino acid residues of the α1β1 binding site, arginine α2(IV)461 and the two aspartate residues α1(IV)461, are all located on different chains. Since the spatial array of the three residues depends on the stagger of the chains within the triple helix, the stagger has been elucidated using fluorescence resonance energy transfer with phenylalanine α1(IV)473 and tryptophan α2(IV)479 as the fluorescent donor/acceptor pair. The distance R between phenylalanine and tryptophan was determined by analysis of the energy transfer efficiency, E, and the orientation factor, κ2. In parallel, distance R and orientation factor, κ2were also calculated from the coordinates of the triple helix. Comparison of the calculated and empirically determined values unequivocally showed the stagger to be α1′α1α2. This arrangement of the three α chains describes the conformation of the α1β1 integrin recognition site, that is the distinct orientation of the side-chains of the essential residues aspartate and arginine in respect to the helix axis.
