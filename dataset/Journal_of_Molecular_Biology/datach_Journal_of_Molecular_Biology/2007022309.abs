a type iv modification dependent restriction nuclease that targets glucosylated hydroxymethyl cytosine modified dnas
the escherichia coli ct  prophage exclusion genes gmrs and gmrd were found to encode a novel type iv modification dependent restriction nuclease that targets and digests glucosylated glc hydroxymethylcytosine hmc dnas the protein products gmrs   kda and gmrd   kda were purified and found to be inactive separately but together degraded several different glc hmc modified dnas t  t and t  the gmr enzyme is able to degrade both   glucosy hmc t dna and   glucosyl hmc t dna whereas no activity was observed against non modified dnas including unmodified t cytosine c dna or non glucosylated t hmc dna enzyme activity requires ntp favors utp is stimulated by calcium and initially produces  kb dna fragments that are further degraded to low molecular mass products the enzyme is inhibited by the t phage internal protein i  ipi  to which it was found to bind overall activities of the purified gmrsd enzyme are in good agreement with the properties of the cloned gmr genes in vivo and suggest a restriction enzyme specific for sugar modified hmc dnas ipi thus represents a third generation bacteriophage defense against restriction nucleases of the gmr type
