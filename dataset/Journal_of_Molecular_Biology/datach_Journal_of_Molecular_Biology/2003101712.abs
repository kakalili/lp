three dimensional structure of the channel forming trans membrane domain of virus protein  u   vpu from hiv
the three dimensional structure of the channel forming trans membrane domain of virus protein  u   vpu of hiv  was determined by nmr spectroscopy in micelle and bilayer samples vpu    is a  residue polypeptide that consists of residues    from the n terminus of vpu and a six residue  solubility tag  at its c terminus that facilitates the isolation purification and sample preparation of this highly hydrophobic minimal channel forming domain nearly all of the resonances in the two dimensional h  n hsqc spectrum of uniformly  n labeled vpu    in micelles are superimposable on those from the corresponding residues in the spectrum of full length vpu which indicates that the structure of the trans membrane domain is not strongly affected by the presence of the cytoplasmic domain at its c terminus the two dimensional h  n pisema spectrum of vpu    in lipid bilayers aligned between glass plates has been fully resolved and assigned the  wheel like  pattern of resonances in the spectrum is characteristic of a slightly tilted membrane spanning helix experiments were also performed on weakly aligned micelle samples to measure residual dipolar couplings and chemical shift anisotropies the analysis of the pisa wheels and dipolar waves obtained from both weakly and completely aligned samples show that vpu    has a trans membrane  helix spanning residues    with an average tilt of    the helix is kinked slightly at ile  which results in tilts of   for residues    and   for residues     a structural fit to the experimental solid state nmr data results in a three dimensional structure with precision equivalent to an rmsd of    vpu    exists mainly as an oligomer on pfo page and forms ion channels a most frequent conductance of    ps in lipid bilayers the structural features of the trans membrane domain are determinants of the ion channel activity that may be associated with the protein s role in facilitating the budding of new virus particles from infected cells
