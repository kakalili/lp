structural and functional analyses of  glucosidase b from thermotoga neapolitana a thermostable three domain representative of glycoside hydrolase
based on sequence and phylogenetic analyses glycoside hydrolase gh family  can be divided into several clusters that differ in the length of their primary sequences however structural data on representatives of gh are still scarce since only three of their structures are known and only one of them has been thoroughly characterized  that of an exohydrolase from barley to allow a deeper structural understanding of the gh family we have determined the crystal structure of the thermostable  glucosidase from thermotoga neapolitana which has potentially important applications in environmentally friendly industrial biosynthesis at a resolution of      selected active site mutants have been characterized kinetically and the structure of the mutant d  a is presented at     resolution bgl b from th neapolitana is the first example of a gh glucosidase with a three domain structure it is composed of an     domain similar to a triose phosphate isomerase barrel a five stranded    sandwich domain both of which are important for active site organization  and a c terminal fibronectin type iii domain of unknown function remarkably the direction of the second  strand of the triose phosphate isomerase barrel domain is reversed which has implications for the active site shape the active site at the interface of domains  and  is much more open to solvent than the corresponding site in the structurally homologous enzyme from barley and only the   site is well defined the structures in combination with kinetic studies of active site variants allow the identification of essential catalytic residues the nucleophile d  and the acid base e   as well as other residues at the   subsite including d  and w   which by mutagenesis are shown to be important for substrate accommodation interaction the position of the fibronectin type iii domain excludes a direct participation of this domain in the recognition of small substrates although it may be involved in the anchoring of the enzyme on large polymeric substrates and in thermostability
