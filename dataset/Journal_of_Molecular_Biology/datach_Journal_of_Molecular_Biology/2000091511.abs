structures of thermolabile mutants of human glutathione transferase p   edited by r huber
an n capping box motif ser thr xaa xaa asp is strictly conserved at the beginning of helix   in the core of virtually all glutathione transferases gst and gst related proteins it has been demonstrated that this local motif is important in determining the  helical propensity of the isolated   peptide and plays a crucial role in the folding and stability of gsts its removal by site directed mutagenesis generated temperature sensitive folding mutants unable to refold at physiological temperature   c  in the present work variants of human gstp   s  a and d  a  in which the capping residues have been substituted by alanine have been generated and purified for structural analysis thus for the first time temperature sensitive folding mutants of an enzyme expressed at a permissive temperature have been crystallized and their three dimensional structures determined by x ray crystallography the crystal structures of human pi class gst temperature sensitive mutants provide a basis for understanding the structural origin of the dramatic effects observed on the overall stability of the enzyme at higher temperatures upon single substitution of a capping residue
