dealing with transcriptional outbursts during s phase to protect genomic integrity
transcription during s phase needs to be spatially and temporally regulated to prevent collisions between the transcription and replication machineries cells have evolved a number of mechanisms to make both processes compatible under normal growth conditions when conflict management fails the head on encounter between rna and dna polymerases results in genomic instability unless conflict resolution mechanisms are activated nevertheless there are specific situations in which cells need to dramatically change their transcriptional landscape to adapt to environmental challenges signal transduction pathways such as stress activated protein kinases sapks  serve to regulate gene expression in response to environmental insults prototypical members of sapks are the yeast hog and mammalian p  in response to stress p  hog sapks control transcription and also regulate cell cycle progression when yeast cells are stressed during s phase hog promotes gene induction and remarkably also delays replication by directly affecting early origin firing and fork progression therefore by delaying replication hog plays a key role in preventing conflicts between rna and dna polymerases in this review we focus on the genomic determinants and mechanisms that make compatible transcription with replication during s phase to prevent genomic instability especially in response to environmental changes
