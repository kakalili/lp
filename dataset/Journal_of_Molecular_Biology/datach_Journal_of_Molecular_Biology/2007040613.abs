propagation of dynamic changes in barnase upon binding of barstar an nmr and computational study
nmr spectroscopy and computer simulations were used to examine changes in chemical shifts and in dynamics of the ribonuclease barnase that result upon binding to its natural inhibitor barstar although the spatial structures of free and bound barnase are very similar binding results in changes of the dynamics of both fast side chains as revealed by h relaxation measurements and nmr chemical shifts in an extended  sheet that is located far from the binding interface both side chain dynamics and chemical shifts are sensitive to variations in the ensemble populations of the inter converting molecular states which can escape direct structural observation molecular dynamics simulations of free barnase and barnase in complex with barstar as well as a normal mode analysis of barnase using a gaussian network model reveal relatively rigid domains that are separated by the extended  sheet mentioned above the observed changes in nmr parameters upon ligation can thus be rationalized in terms of changes in inter domain dynamics and in populations of exchanging states without measurable structural changes this provides an alternative model for the propagation of a molecular response to ligand binding across a protein that is based exclusively on changes in dynamics
