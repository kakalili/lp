investigation of an anomalously accelerating substitution in the folding of a prototypical two state protein
the folding rates of two state single domain proteins are generally resistant to small scale changes in amino acid sequence for example having surveyed here over   single residue substitutions in  well characterized two state proteins we find that the majority    of these substitutions affect folding rates by less than a factor of  and that only  affect folding rates by more than a factor of  among those substitutions that significantly affect folding rates we find that accelerating substitutions are an order of magnitude less common than those that decelerate the process one of the most extreme outliers in this data set an arginine to phenylalanine substitution at position   r f of chymotrypsin inhibitor  ci  accelerates the protein s folding rate by a factor of  relative to that of the wild type protein and is the most accelerating substitution reported to date in a two state protein in order to better understand the origins of this anomalous behavior we have characterized the kinetics of multiple additional substitutions at this position we find that substitutions at position  in ci fall into two distinct classes the first comprising residues that ablate the charge of the wild type arginine but retain the hydrophobicity of its alkane chain accelerate folding by at least  fold the second class comprising all other residues produces folding rates within a factor of two of the wild type rate a significant positive correlation between hydrophobicity and folding rate across all of the residues we have characterized at this position suggests that the hydrophobic methylene units of the wild type arginine play a significant role in stabilizing the folding transition state likewise studies of the ph dependence of the histidine substitution indicate a strong correlation between folding rate and charge state thus mutations that ablate the arginine s positive charge while retaining the hydrophobic contacts of its methylene units tend to dramatically accelerate folding previous studies have suggested that arginine  plays an important functional role in ci  which may explain why it is highly conserved despite the anomalously large deceleration it produces in the folding of this protein
