new biological insights from better structure models
structure validation is a key component of all steps in the structure determination process from structure building refinement deposition and evaluation all the way to post deposition optimisation of structures in the protein data bank pdb by re refinement and re building today many aspects of protein structures are understood better than  years ago and combined with improved software and more computing power the automated pdb redo procedure can significantly improve about   of all x ray structures ever deposited in the pdb we review structure validation structure improvement and a series of validation resources and facilities that give access to improved pdb files and to reports on the quality of the original and the improved structures post deposition optimisation generally leads to improved protein structures and a series of examples will illustrate how that in turn leads to improved or even novel biological insights
