crystal structure of the vertebrate nadp h dependent alcohol dehydrogenase adh
the amphibian enzyme adh  previously named class iv like is the only known vertebrate alcohol dehydrogenase adh with specificity towards nadp h  the three dimensional structures of adh and of the binary complex adh  nadp have been now determined and refined to resolutions of    and    respectively the coenzyme and substrate specificity of adh  that has     sequence identity with vertebrate nad h dependent adhs suggest a role in aldehyde reduction probably as a retinal reductase the large volume of the substrate binding pocket can explain both the high catalytic efficiency of adh with retinoids and the high km value for ethanol preference of nadp h appears to be achieved by the presence in adh of the triad gly  thr  his  and the recruitment of conserved lys   which define a binding pocket for the terminal phosphate group of the cofactor nadp h binds to adh in an extended conformation that superimposes well with the nad h molecules found in nad h dependent adh complexes no additional reshaping of the dinucleotide binding site is observed which explains why nad h can also be used as a cofactor by adh  the structural features support the classification of adh as an independent adh class
