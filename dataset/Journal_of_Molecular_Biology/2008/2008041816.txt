The bacterial AAA+ protein ClpB and its eukaryotic homologue Hsp104 ensure thermotolerance of their respective organisms by reactivating aggregated proteins in cooperation with the Hsp70/Hsp40 chaperone system. Like many members of the AAA+ superfamily, the ClpB protomers form ringlike homohexameric complexes. The mechanical energy necessary to disentangle protein aggregates is provided by ATP hydrolysis at the two nucleotide-binding domains of each monomer. Previous studies on ClpB and Hsp104 show a complex interplay of domains and subunits resulting in homotypic and heterotypic cooperativity. Using mutations in the Walker A and Walker B nucleotide-binding motifs in combination with mixing experiments we investigated the degree of inter-subunit coupling with respect to different aspects of the ClpB working cycle. We find that subunits are tightly coupled with regard to ATPase and chaperone activity, but no coupling can be observed for ADP binding. Comparison of the data with statistical calculations suggests that for double Walker mutants, approximately two in six subunits are sufficient to abolish chaperone and ATPase activity completely. In further experiments, we determined the dynamics of subunit reshuffling. Our results show that ClpB forms a very dynamic complex, reshuffling subunits on a timescale comparable to steady-state ATP hydrolysis. We propose that this could be a protection mechanism to prevent very stable aggregates from becoming suicide inhibitors for ClpB.
