genetic interaction between yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae release factors and the decoding region of  s rrna edited by d draper
functional and structural similarities between trna and eukaryotic class  release factors erf  described previously provide evidence for the molecular mimicry concept this concept is supported here by the demonstration of a genetic interaction between erf and the decoding region of the ribosomal rna the site of trna mrna interaction we show that the conditional lethality caused by a mutation in domain  of yeast erf  p a  that mimics the trna anticodon stem loop is rescued by compensatory mutations a  g rdn  and u  c hyg  in helix  of the decoding region and by u  c rdn  and g  a rdn  mutations in helix  of the  s rrna the rdn  mutation creates a c   g   base pair in yeast rrna that is analogous to that in prokaryotic rrna known to be important for high affinity paromomycin binding to the ribosome indeed rdn makes yeast cells extremely sensitive to paromomycin indicating that the natural high resistance of the yeast ribosome to paromomycin is in large part due to the absence of the      base pair the rdn  and hyg mutations also partially compensate for inactivation of the eukaryotic release factor  erf  resulting from the formation of the psi  prion a self reproducible termination deficient conformation of erf  however rdn  but not hyg  rescues the conditional cell lethality caused by a gtpase domain mutation r  g in erf  other antisuppressor rrna mutations rdn g  a  rdn t c  t and rdn a c  a  strongly inhibit psi  mediated stop codon read through but do not cure cells of the psi  prion interestingly cells bearing hyg seem to enable psi  strains to accumulate larger sup p aggregates upon sup p overproduction suggesting a lower toxicity of overproduced sup p when the termination defect caused by psi  is partly relieved
