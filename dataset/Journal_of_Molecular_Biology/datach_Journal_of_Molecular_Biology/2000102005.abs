recognition of structurally diverse substrates by type ii  hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenase hadh ii amyloid  binding alcohol dehydrogenase abad  edited by i a wilson
human type ii hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenase amyloid  binding alcohol dehydrogenase hadh ii abad is an oxidoreductase whose salient features include broad substrate specificity encompassing  hydroxyacyl coa derivatives hydroxysteroids alcohols and  hydroxybutyrate and the capacity to bind amyloid  peptide leading to propagation of amyloid induced cell stress in this study we examine the structure and enzymatic activity of the homologous rat hadh ii abad enzyme we report the crystal structure of rat hadh ii abad as a binary complex with its nadh cofactor to    resolution as a ternary complex with nad and  ketobutyrate acetoacetate to    resolution and as a ternary complex with nadh and   estradiol to    resolution this first crystal structure of an hadh ii confirms these enzymes are closely related to the short chain hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases and differ substantially from the classic type i  hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenases binding of the ketobutyrate substrate is accompanied by closure of the active site specificity loop whereas the steroid substrate does not appear to require closure for binding despite the different chemical nature of the two bound substrates the presentation of chemical groups within the active site of each complex is remarkably similar allowing a general mechanism for catalytic activity to be proposed there is a characteristic extension to the active site that is likely to accommodate the coa moiety of  hydroxyacyl coa substrates rat hadh ii abad also binds amyloid       peptide with a kd of  nm which is similar to the interaction exhibited between this peptide and human hadh ii abad these studies provide the first structural insights into hadh ii abad interaction with its substrates and indicate the relevance of the rodent enzyme and associated rodent models for analysis of hadh ii abad  s physiologic and pathophysiologic properties
