transcription factors gata elt  and forkhead hnf  pha  regulate the tropomyosin gene expression in the pharynx and intestine of caenorhabditis elegans
gene regulation during development is an important biological activity that leads to synthesis of biomolecules at specific locations and specific times the single tropomyosin gene of caenorhabditis elegans tmy  lev   produces four isoforms of protein two from the external promoter and two from the internal promoter we investigated the internal promoter of tropomyosin to identify sequences that regulate expression of tmy  in the pharynx and intestine by promoter deletion of tmy  reporters as well as by database analyses a   bp fragment that contained binding sequences for a gata factor for a chicken cdxa homolog and for a forkhead factor was identified both the forkhead and cdxa binding sequences contributed to pharyngeal and intestinal expression in addition the gata site also influenced intestinal expression of tmy  reporter we showed that elt  and pha  proteins interact directly with the gata and forkhead binding sequences respectively in gel mobility shift assays rna interference knockdown of elt  diminished tmy   gfp expression in the intestine in contrast to rna interference knockdown of pha  expression of tmy   gfp in pha  smg  mutants was slightly weaker than that of the wild type ectopic expression of pha  and elt  by heat shock was sufficient to elicit widespread expression of tmy   lacz reporter in embryos we found no indication of a synergistic relation between elt  and pha  based on our data pha  and cdxa function as general transcription factors for pharyngeal and intestinal regulation of tmy  we present models by which elt  pha  and cdxa orchestrate expression from the internal promoter of tmy
