characterization of the reactivity determinants of a novel hairpin substrate of yeast rnase iii
rnase iii enzymes form a conserved family of proteins that specifically cleave double stranded dsrna  these proteins are involved in a variety of cellular functions including the processing of many non coding rnas mrna decay and rna interference yeast rnase iii rnt p selects its substrate by recognizing the structure generated by a conserved ngnn tetraloop g loop  mutations of the invariant guanosine stringently inhibit binding and cleavage of all known rnt p substrates surprisingly we have found that the   end of small nucleolar rna  is processed by rnt p in the absence of a g loop instead biochemical and structural analyses revealed that cleavage in this case is directed by a hairpin capped with an aagu tetraloop with a preferred adenosine in the first position a loop  chemical probing indicated that a loops adopt a distinct structure that varies at the   end where rnt p interacts with g loops consistently chemical footprinting and chemical interference assays indicate that rnt p binds to g and a loops using different sets of nucleotides also cleavage and binding assays showed that the n terminal domain of rnt p aids selection of a capped hairpins together the results suggest that rnt p recognizes at least two distinct classes of tetraloops using flexible protein rna interactions this underscores the capacity of double stranded rna binding proteins to use several recognition motifs for substrate identification
