mitochondrial genome maintenance  mgm  protein alters membrane topology and promotes local membrane bending
large gtpases of the dynamin superfamily promote membrane fusion and division processes that are crucial for intracellular trafficking and organellar dynamics to promote membrane scission dynamin proteins polymerize wrap around and constrict the membrane however the mechanism underlying their role in membrane fusion remains unclear we previously reported that the mitochondrial dynamin related protein mitochondrial genome maintenance  mgm  mediates fusion by first tethering opposing membranes and then undergoing a nucleotide dependent structural transition however it is still unclear how mgm directly affects the membrane to drive fusion of tethered membranes here we show that mgm association with the membrane alters the topography of the membrane promoting local membrane bending we also demonstrate that mgm creates membrane ruffles resulting in the formation of tubular structures on both supported lipid bilayers and liposomes these data suggest that mgm membrane interactions impose a mechanical force on the membrane to overcome the hydrophilic repulsion of the phospholipid head groups and initiate the fusion reaction the work reported here provides new insights into a possible mechanism of mgm driven mitochondrial membrane fusion and sheds light into how members of the dynamin superfamily function as fusion molecules
