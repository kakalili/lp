think twice understanding the high potency of bis phenyl methane inhibitors of thrombin
successful design of potent and selective protein inhibitors in terms of structure based drug design strongly relies on the correct understanding of the molecular features determining the ligand binding to the target protein we present a case study of serine protease inhibitors with a bis phenyl methane moiety binding into the s pocket these inhibitors bind with remarkable potency to the active site of thrombin the blood coagulation factor iia a combination of x ray crystallography and isothermal titration calorimetry provides conclusive insights into the driving forces responsible for the surprisingly high potency of these inhibitors analysis of six well resolved crystal structures resolution         along with the thermodynamic data allows an explanation of the tight binding of the bis phenyl methane inhibitors interestingly the two phenyl rings contribute to binding affinity for very different reasons   a fact that can only be elucidated by a structure based approach the first phenyl moiety occupies the hydrophobic s pocket resulting in a mainly entropic advantage of binding this observation is based on the displacement of structural water molecules from the s pocket that are observed in complexes with inhibitors that do not bind in the s pocket the same classic hydrophobic effect cannot explain the enhanced binding affinity resulting from the attachment of the second more solvent exposed phenyl ring for the bis phenyl methane inhibitors an observed adaptive rotation of a glutamate residue adjacent to the s binding pocket attracted our attention the rotation of this glutamate into salt bridging distance with a lysine moiety correlates with an enhanced enthalpic contribution to binding for these highly potent thrombin binders this explanation for the magnitude of the attractive force is confirmed by data retrieved by a relibase search of several thrombin  inhibitor complexes deposited in the protein data bank exhibiting similar molecular features special attention was attributed to putative changes in the protonation states of the interaction partners for this purpose two analogous inhibitors differing mainly in their potential to change the protonation state of a hydrogen bond donor functionality were compared buffer dependencies of the binding enthalpy associated with complex formation could be traced by isothermal titration calorimetry which revealed along with analysis of the crystal structures resolution   and      that a virtually compensating proton interchange between enzyme inhibitor and buffer is responsible for the observed buffer independent thermodynamic signatures
