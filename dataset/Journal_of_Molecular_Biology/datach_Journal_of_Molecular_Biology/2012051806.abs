rescue of the transcription factors sp and nfi in human skin keratinocytes through a feeder layer dependent suppression of the proteasome activity
co culturing human skin keratinocytes along with a feeder layer has proven to considerably improve their proliferative properties by delaying massive induction of terminal differentiation through a yet unclear mechanism we recently reported that irradiated t  i t  fibroblasts used as a feeder layer increase the nuclear content of sp  a positive transcription factor tf that plays a critical role in many cellular functions including cell proliferation into both adult skin keratinocytes and newborn skin keratinocytes in this study we examined the influence of i t on the expression and dna binding of nfi another tf important for cell proliferation and cell cycle progression and attempted to decipher the mechanism by which the feeder layer contributes at maintaining higher levels of these tfs in skin keratinocytes our results indicate that co culturing both adult skin keratinocytes and newborn skin keratinocytes along with a feeder layer dramatically increases glycosylation of nfi and may prevent it from being degraded by the proteasome
