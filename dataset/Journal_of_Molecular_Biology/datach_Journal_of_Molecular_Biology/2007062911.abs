identification of a single hnh active site in type iis restriction endonuclease eco i
type iis restriction endonuclease eco i is a  short distance cutter   which cleaves dna strands close to its recognition sequence    ggtctc    previously it has been proposed that related endonucleases recognizing a common sequence core gtctc possess two active sites for cleavage of both strands in the dna substrate here we present bioinformatic identification and experimental evidence for a single nuclease active site we identified a short region of homology between eco i and hnh nucleases constructed a three dimensional model of the putative catalytic domain and validated our predictions by random and site specific mutagenesis the restriction mechanism of eco i is suggested by analogy to the mechanisms of phage t endonuclease vii and homing endonuclease i ppoi we propose that residues d  and n  coordinate the cofactor h  acts as a general base activating water molecule for the nucleophilic attack k  together with r  and d  are located in close proximity to the active center and are essential for correct folding of catalytic motif while d  together with r  and d  could be directly involved in dna binding we also predict that the eco i catalytic domain contains a putative zn binding site which is essential for its structural integrity our results suggest that the hnh like active site is involved in the cleavage of both strands in the dna substrate on the other hand analysis of site specific mutants in the region previously suggested to harbor the second active site revealed its irrelevance to the nuclease activity thus our data argue against the earlier prediction and indicate the presence of a single conserved active site in type iis restriction endonucleases that recognize common sequence core gtctc
