distinct features of cap binding by eif e b proteins
eif e b closely related to the canonical translation initiation factor e eif e a  cap binding protein is highly expressed in mouse xenopus and zebrafish oocytes we have previously characterized eif e b as a component of the cpeb mrnp translation repressor complex along with the eif e binding protein e transporter the xp  ddx rna helicase and additional rna binding proteins eif e b exhibited only very weak interactions with m gtp sepharose and rather than binding eif g interacted with e t here we undertook a detailed examination of both xenopus and human eif e b interactions with cap analogues using fluorescence titration and homology modeling the predicted structure of eif e b maintains the    fold characteristic of eif e proteins and its cap binding pocket is similarly arranged by critical amino acids trp  trp   glu   trp   arg   arg  and lys  and residues of the c terminal loop however we demonstrate that eif e b is  fold less well able to bind the cap than eif e a both proteins being highly stimulated by methylation at n of guanine moreover eif e b proteins are distinguishable from eif e a by a set of conserved amino acid substitutions several of which are located near to cap binding residues indeed eif e b possesses several distinct features namely enhancement of cap binding by a benzyl group at n position of guanine a reduced response to increasing length of the phosphate chain and increased binding to a cap separated by a linker from sepharose suggesting differences in the arrangement of the protein s core in agreement mutagenesis of the amino acids differentiating eif e b from eif e a reduces cap binding by eif e a  fold demonstrating their role in modulating cap binding
