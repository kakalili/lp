molecular cloning characterisation and ligand bound structure of an azoreductase from pseudomonas aeruginosa
the gene pa   from pseudomonas aeruginosa strain pao  which is annotated as a probable acyl carrier protein phosphodiesterase acpd  has been cloned and heterologously overexpressed in escherichia coli the purified recombinant enzyme exhibits activity corresponding to that of azoreductase but not acpd each recombinant protein molecule has an estimated molecular mass of    da and one non covalently bound fmn as co factor this enzyme now identified as azoreductase  from pseudomonas aeruginosa paazor  is a flavodoxin like protein with an apparent molecular mass of   kda as determined by gel filtration chromatography indicating that the protein is likely to be tetrameric in solution the three dimensional structure of paazor  in complex with the substrate methyl red was solved at a resolution of     by x ray crystallography the protein exists as a dimer of dimers in the crystal lattice with two spatially separated active sites per dimer and the active site of paazor was shown to be a well conserved hydrophobic pocket formed between two monomers the paazor enzyme is able to reduce different classes of azo dyes and activate several azo pro drugs used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease ibd  during azo reduction fmn serves as a redox centre in the electron transferring system by mediating the electron transfer from nad p h to the azo substrate the spectral properties of paazor demonstrate the hydrophobic interaction between fmn and the active site in the protein the structure of the ligand bound protein also highlights the  stacking interactions between fmn and the azo substrate
