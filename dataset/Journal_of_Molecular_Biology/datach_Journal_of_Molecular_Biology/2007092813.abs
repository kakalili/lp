mutation of a conserved active site residue converts tyrosyl dna phosphodiesterase i into a dna topoisomerase i dependent poison
tyrosyl dna phosphodiesterase  tdp  catalyzes the resolution of   and   phospho dna adducts a defective mutant associated with the recessive neurodegenerative disease scan  accumulates tdp  dna complexes in vitro to assess the conservation of enzyme architecture a     crystal structure of yeast tdp was determined that is very similar to human tdp  poorly conserved regions of primary structure are peripheral to an essentially identical catalytic core enzyme mechanism was also conserved because the yeast scan mutant h  r enhanced cell sensitivity to the dna topoisomerase i top  poison camptothecin a more severe top dependent lethality of tdp h  n was drug independent coinciding with increased covalent top  dna and tdp  dna complex formation in vivo however both h  mutants were recessive to wild type tdp  thus yeast h  acts in the general acid base catalytic mechanism of tdp to resolve   phosphotyrosyl and   phosphoamide linkages however the distinct pattern of mutant tdp activity evident in yeast cells suggests a more severe defect in tdp h  n catalyzed resolution of   phospho adducts
