non proteolytic functions of calpain  in sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscles
mutations in capn capn  which codes for skeletal muscle specific calpain  p  protease are responsible for limb girdle muscular dystrophy type a using  knock in   referred to as capn cs cs mice in which the endogenous calpain  is replaced with a mutant calpain  c  s which is a proteolytically inactive but structurally intact calpain  we demonstrated in our previous studies that loss of calpain  protease activity causes muscular dystrophy ojima k et al     j clin invest           however compared to capn null capn     mice capn cs cs mice showed less severe dystrophic symptoms this suggests that calpain  also has a non proteolytic function this study aimed to elucidate the non proteolytic functions of calpain  through comparison of capn cs cs mice with capn     mice we found that calpain  is a component of the sarcoplasmic reticulum sr  and that calpain  interacts with but does not proteolyze typical sr components such as ryanodine receptor and calsequestrin furthermore capn cs cs mice showed that the nonenzymatic role of calpain  is required for proper ca  efflux from the sr to cytosol during muscle contraction these results indicate that calpain  functions as a nonenzymatic element for the ca  efflux machinery in the sr rather than as a protease thus defects in the nonenzymatic function of calpain  must also be involved in the pathogenesis of limb girdle muscular dystrophy type a
