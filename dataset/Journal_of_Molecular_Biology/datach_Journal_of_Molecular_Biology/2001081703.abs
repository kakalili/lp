solution structures by h nmr of the novel cyclic trypsin inhibitor sfti  from sunflower seeds and an acyclic permutant edited by m f summers
sfti  is a recently discovered cyclic peptide trypsin inhibitor from sunflower seeds comprising  amino acid residues it is the most potent known bowman birk inhibitor and the only naturally occurring cyclic one the solution structure of sfti  has been determined by h nmr spectroscopy and compared with a synthetic acyclic permutant the solution structures of both are remarkably similar the lowest energy structures from each family of  structures of cyclic and acyclic sfti  have an rmsd over the backbone and heavy atoms of     and     respectively the structures consist of two short antiparallel  strands joined by an extended loop containing the active site at one end cyclic sfti  also has a hairpin turn completing the cycle both molecules contain particularly stable arrangements of cross linking hydrogen bonds between the  strands and a single disulfide bridge making them rigid and well defined in solution these stable arrangements allow both the cyclic and acyclic variants of sfti  to inhibit trypsin with very high potencies   nm and   nm respectively  the cyclic nature of sfti  appears to have evolved to provide higher trypsin inhibition as well as higher stability the solution structures are similar to the crystal structure of the cyclic inhibitor in complex with trypsin the lack of a major conformational change upon binding suggests that the structure of sfti  is rigid and already pre organized for maximal binding due to minimization of entropic losses compared to a more flexible ligand these properties make sfti  an ideal platform for the design of small peptidic pharmaceuticals or pesticides
