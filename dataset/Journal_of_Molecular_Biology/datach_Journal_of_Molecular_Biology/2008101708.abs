molecular basis of recognition of human osteopontin by  c  a potential therapeutic antibody for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis
osteopontin plays an important role in the development and perpetuation of rheumatoid arthritis ra  antibodies targeting osteopontin have shown promising therapeutic benefits against this disease we have previously reported a novel anti ra monoclonal antibody namely  c  and shown it capable of alleviating the symptoms of ra in a murine collagen induced arthritis model restoring the cytokine production profile in joint tissues and reducing t cell recall responses to collagen type ii we describe here the crystal structure of  c in complex with its epitope peptide analyses of the complex structure reveal the molecular mechanism of osteopontin recognition by  c  the peptide folds into two tandem  turns and two key residues of the peptide are identified to be critical for the recognition by  c  trpp  is deeply embedded into a hydrophobic pocket formed by alal  tyrl  leul  tyrl  phel  and meth  and therefore has extensive hydrophobic interactions with  c  while aspp  has a network of hydrophilic interactions with residues argh  argh  serh  and asnh  of the antibody besides the complementarity determining region loops the framework region l of  c is also shown to interact with the epitope peptide which is not common in the antibody  antigen interactions and thus could be exploited in the engineering of  c  these results not only provide valuable information for further improvement of  c such as chimerization or humanization for its therapeutic application but also reveal the features of this specific epitope of osteopontin that may be useful for the development of new antibody drugs against ra
