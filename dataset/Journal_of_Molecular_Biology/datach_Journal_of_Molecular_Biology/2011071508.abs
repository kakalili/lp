symmetry and asymmetry of the ring  ring dimer of rad
the human ubiquitin conjugating enzyme rad  e  with ubiquitin ligase enzyme rad  ring e  monoubiquitinates proliferating cell nuclear antigen at stalled replication forks in dna translesion synthesis here we determine the structure of the homodimeric rad  ring domains by x ray crystallography and classify it to ring  ring dimers that dimerize through helices adjacent to the ring domains and through the canonical ring domains using nmr spectroscopy and site directed mutagenesis we demonstrate that the rad b binding site for the rad  ring domain strongly resembles that of other e e ring u box complexes we show that the homodimeric rad  ring domain can recruit two rad b e enzymes whereas the full length rad  homodimer binds only to a single rad b molecule such asymmetry is a common feature of ring  ring heterodimers and has been observed for the chip u box homodimer we propose that asymmetry may be a common feature of dimeric ring e ligases
