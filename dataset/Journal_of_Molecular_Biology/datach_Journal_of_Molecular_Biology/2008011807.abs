two structures of a  cro variant highlight dimer flexibility but disfavor major dimer distortions upon specific binding of cognate dna
previously reported crystal structures of free and dna bound dimers of  cro differ strongly about    backbone rmsd  suggesting both flexibility of the dimer interface and induced fit protein structure changes caused by sequence specific dna binding here we present two crystal structures in space groups p   and c at   and     resolution respectively of a variant of  cro with three mutations in its recognition helix q p a s k q or psq for short  one dimer structure p   psq form  resembles the dna bound wild type cro dimer     backbone rmsd  while the other c  psq form  resembles neither unbound      nor bound      wild type cro both psq form  and unbound wild type dimer crystals have a similar interdimer  sheet interaction between the   strands at the edges of the dimer in the former an infinite open  structure along one crystal axis results while in the latter a closed tetrameric barrel is formed neither the dna bound wild type structure nor psq form  contains these interdimer interactions we propose that  sheet superstructures resulting from crystal contact interactions distort cro dimers from their preferred solution conformation which actually resembles the dna bound structure these results highlight the remarkable flexibility of  cro but also suggest that sequence specific dna binding may not induce large changes in the protein structure
