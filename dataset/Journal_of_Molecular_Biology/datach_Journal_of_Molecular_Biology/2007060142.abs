on itinerant water molecules and detectability of protein  protein interfaces through comparative analysis of homologues
we discuss the question of which residues are sufficiently important for protein  protein interaction to be under notable evolutionary pressure its interest stems from the applicability of this knowledge in the reverse direction to detect a protein  protein interface on a single protomer starting from the rate of mutation of participating residues using the analysis of trajectories produced by the molecular dynamics simulations we suggest that in the case of water soluble proteins a large fraction of evolutionarily privileged residues can be found by considering the dynamic behavior of the protein interface and by looking for residues which exchange water molecules with the bulk of the solvent outstandingly slowly tentatively termed  dry residues   we show that the dry interface residues are better conserved across homologues than the generic  geometric footprint  and can be quite reliably detected through comparative analysis of protein homologues without strong dependence on the choice of method furthermore we show that dry residues distinguish themselves through a set of biophysical properties consistent with the known mechanisms of protein oligomerization their compositional shift toward nonpolar overlap and co location with residues exhibiting low mobility their two to threefold increased propensity over the rest of the geometric footprint to form hydrogen bonds and four to almost tenfold increased likelihood to participate in formation of salt bridges these properties consistently help understand the observed increase in the evolutionary pressure that dry residues experience
