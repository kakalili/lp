dynamic requirements for a functional protein hinge
the enzyme triosephosphate isomerase tim is a model of catalytic efficiency the  residue loop  at the tim active site plays a major role in this enzymatic prowess the loop moves between open and closed states which facilitate substrate access and catalysis respectively the n and c terminal hinges of loop  control this motion here we detail flexibility requirements for hinges in a comparative solution nmr study of wild type wt tim and a quintuple mutant pgg ggg  the latter contained glycine substitutions in the n terminal hinge at val  and trp   which follow the essential pro   and in the c terminal hinge at lys   thr   and ala   previous work demonstrated that pgg ggg has a tenfold higher km value and   fold reduced kcat relative to wt with either d glyceraldehyde  phosphate or dihyrdroxyacetone phosphate as substrate our nmr results explain this in terms of altered loop  dynamics in pgg ggg in the mutant loop  exhibits conformational heterogeneity with corresponding motional rates lt   s   that are an order of magnitude slower than the natural wt loop  motion at the same time nanosecond timescale motions of loop  are greatly enhanced in the mutant relative to wt these differences from wt behavior occur in both apo pgg ggg and in the form bound to the reaction intermediate analog  phosphoglycolate  pga  in addition as indicated by h  n and  co chemical shifts the glycine substitutions diminished the enzyme s response to ligand and induced structural perturbations in apo and  pga bound forms of tim that are atypical of wt these data show that pgg ggg exists in multiple conformations that are not fully competent for ligand binding or catalysis these experiments elucidate an important principle of catalytic hinge design in proteins structural rigidity is essential for focused motional freedom of active site loops
