arrestin mobilizes signaling proteins to the cytoskeleton and redirects their activity
arrestins regulate the activity and subcellular localization of g protein coupled receptors and other signaling molecules here we demonstrate that arrestins bind microtubules mts in vitro and in vivo the mt binding site on arrestins overlaps significantly with the receptor binding site but the conformations of mt bound and receptor bound arrestin are different arrestins recruit erk  and the e ubiquitin ligase mdm to mts in cells similar to the arrestin dependent mobilization of these proteins to the receptor arrestin mediated sequestration of erk to mts reduces the level of erk activation in contrast recruitment of mdm to mts by arrestin channels mdm activity toward cytoskeleton associated proteins increasing their ubiquitination dramatically the mobilization of signaling molecules to mts is a novel biological function of arrestin proteins
