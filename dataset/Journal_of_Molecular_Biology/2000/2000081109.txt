The crystal structure of glycosyltrehalose trehalohydrolase from the hyperthermophilic archaeum Sulfolobus solfataricus KM1 has been solved by multiple isomorphous replacement. The enzyme is an α-amylase (family 13) with unique exo-amylolytic activity for glycosyltrehalosides. It cleaves the α-1,4 glycosidic bond adjacent to the trehalose moiety to release trehalose and maltooligo saccharide. Unlike most other family 13 glycosidases, the enzyme does not require Ca2+ for activity, and it contains an N-terminal extension of ∼100 amino acid residues that is homologous to N-terminal domains found in many glycosidases that recognize branched oligosaccharides. Crystallography revealed the enzyme to exist as a homodimer covalently linked by an intermolecular disulfide bond at residue C298. The existence of the intermolecular disulfide bond was confirmed by biochemical analysis and mutagenesis. The N-terminal extension forms an independent domain connected to the catalytic domain by an extended linker. The functionally essential Ca2+ binding site found in the B domain of α-amylases and many other family 13 glycosidases was found to be replaced by hydrophobic packing interactions. The enzyme also contains a very unusual excursion in the (β/α)8 barrel structure of the catalytic domain. This excursion originates from the bottom of the (β/α)8 barrel between helix 6 and strand 7, but folds upward in a distorted α-hairpin structure to form a part of the substrate binding cleft wall that is possibly critical for the enzyme’s unique substrate selectivity. Participation of an α-β loop in the formation of the substrate binding cleft is a novel feature that is not observed in other known (β/α)8 enzymes.
