The crystal structure of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) integrase that contains in a single polypeptide the core and the C-terminal deoxyoligonucleotide binding domain has been determined at 3 Å resolution with an R-value of 0.203 in the space group P212121. Four integrase core domains and one C-terminal domain are found to be well defined in the asymmetric unit. The segment extending from residues 114 to 121 assumes the same position as seen in the integrase core domain of avian sarcoma virus as well as human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) crystallized in the absence of sodium cacodylate. The flexible loop in the active site, composed of residues 141-151, remains incompletely defined, but the location of the essential Glu152 residue is unambiguous. The residues from 210-218 that link the core and C-terminal domains can be traced as an extension from the core with a short gap at residues 214-215. The Cα folding of the C-terminal domain is similar to the solution structure of this domain from HIV-1 integrase. However, the dimeric form seen in the NMR structure cannot exist as related by the non-crystallographic symmetry in the SIV integrase crystal. The two flexible loops of the C-terminal domain, residues 228-236 and residues 244-249, are much better fixed in the crystal structure than in the NMR structure with the former in the immediate vicinity of the flexible loop of the core domain. The interface between the two domains encompasses a solvent-exclusion area of 1500 Å2. Residues from both domains purportedly involved in DNA binding are narrowly distributed on the same face of the molecule. They include Asp64, Asp116, Glu152 and Lys159 from the core and Arg231, Leu234, Arg262, Arg263 and Lys264 from the C-terminal domain. A model for DNA binding is proposed to bridge the two domains by tethering the 228-236 loop of the C-terminal domain and the flexible loop of the core.
