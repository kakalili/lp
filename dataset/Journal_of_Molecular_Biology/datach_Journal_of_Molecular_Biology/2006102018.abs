engineering biophysical characterisation and binding properties of a soluble mutant form of annexin a domain iv that adopts a partially folded conformation
the four    residue domains repeats that constitute the annexin core structure all possess an identical five  helix bundle topology but the physico chemical properties of the isolated domains are different domain iv of the annexins has previously been expressed only as inclusion bodies resistant to solubilisation analysis of the conserved exposed hydrophobic residues of the four annexin domains reveals that domain iv contains the largest number of hydrophobic residues involved in interfacial contacts with the other domains we designed five constructs of domain iv of annexin a in which several interfacial hydrophobic residues were substituted by hydrophilic residues the mutant domain in which all fully exposed hydrophobic interfacial residues were substituted was isolated as a soluble protein circular dichroism measurements indicate that it harbours a high content of  helical secondary structure and some tertiary structure the cd monitored     nm thermal melting profile suggests a weak cooperative transition nuclear magnetic resonance  h  n correlation spectroscopy reveals heterogeneous line broadening and an intermediate spectral dispersion these properties are indicative of a partially folded protein in which some residues are in a fairly structured conformation whereas others are in an unfolded state this conclusion is corroborated by  anilinonaphthalene  sulfonate fluorescence ans analyses surface plasmon resonance measurements also indicate that this domain binds heparin a known ligand of domain iv in the full length annexin a  although with lower affinity
