assembly of the small outer capsid protein soc on bacteriophage t  a novel system for high density display of multiple large anthrax toxins and foreign proteins on phage capsid
bacteriophage t capsid is a prolate icosahedron composed of the major capsid protein gp   the vertex protein gp   and the portal protein gp  assembled on its surface are   molecules of the non essential small outer capsid protein soc   kda  and   molecules of the highly antigenic outer capsid protein hoc   kda  in this study soc a  triplex  protein that stabilizes t capsid is targeted for molecular engineering of t particle surface using a defined in vitro assembly system anthrax toxins protective antigen lethal factor and their domains fused to soc were efficiently displayed on the capsid both the n and c termini of the  amino acid soc polypeptide can be simultaneously used to display antigens proteins as large as   kda can be stably anchored on the capsid through soc  capsid interactions using both soc and hoc up to   anthrax toxin molecules are assembled on the phage t capsid under controlled conditions we infer from the binding data that a relatively high affinity capsid binding site is located in the middle of the rod shaped soc with the n and c termini facing the  and  fold symmetry axes of the capsid respectively soc subunits interact at these interfaces gluing the adjacent capsid protein hexamers and generating a cage like outer scaffold antigen fusion does interfere with the inter subunit interactions but these interactions are not essential for capsid binding and antigen display these features make the t  soc platform the most robust phage display system reported to date the study offers insights into the architectural design of bacteriophage t virion one of the most stable viruses known and how its capsid surface can be engineered for novel applications in basic molecular biology and biotechnology
