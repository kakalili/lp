mutations that reduce aggregation of the alzheimer s a   peptide an unbiased search for the sequence determinants of a  amyloidogenesis
the primary component of amyloid plaque in the brains of alzheimer s patients is the  residue amyloid  peptide a    although the amino acid residue sequence of a   is known the molecular determinants of a  amyloidogenesis have not been elucidated to facilitate an unbiased search for the sequence determinants of a  aggregation we developed a genetic screen that couples a readily observable phenotype in e coli to the ability of a mutation in a   to reduce aggregation the screen is based on our finding that fusions of the wild type a   sequence to green fluorescent protein gfp form insoluble aggregates in which gfp is inactive cells expressing such fusions do not fluoresce to isolate variants of a   with reduced tendencies to aggregate we constructed and screened libraries of a    gfp fusions in which the sequence of a   was mutated randomly cells expressing gfp fusions to soluble non aggregating variants of a   exhibit green fluorescence implementation of this screen enabled the isolation of  variants of a   with reduced tendencies to aggregate the sequences of most of these variants are consistent with previous models implicating hydrophobic regions as determinants of a   aggregation some of the variants however contain amino acid substitutions not implicated in pre existing models of a  amyloidogenesis
