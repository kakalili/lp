discovery of improved egf agonists using a novel in vitro screening platform
directed evolution is a powerful strategy for protein engineering however evolution of pharmaceutical proteins has been limited by the reliance of current screens on binding interactions here we present a method that identifies protein mutants with improved overall cellular efficacy an objective not feasible with previous approaches mutated protein libraries were produced in soluble active form by means of cell free protein synthesis the efficacy of each individual protein was determined at a uniform dosage with a high throughput protein product assay followed by a cell based functional assay without requiring protein purification we validated our platform by first screening mock libraries of epidermal growth factor egf for stimulation of cell proliferation we then demonstrated its effectiveness by identifying egf mutants with significantly enhanced mitogenic activity at low concentrations compared to that of wild type egf this is the first report of egf mutants with improved biological efficacy despite much previous effort our platform can be extended to engineer a broad range of proteins offering a general method to evolve proteins for improved biological efficacy
