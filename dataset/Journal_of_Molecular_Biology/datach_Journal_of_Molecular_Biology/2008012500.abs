probing protein fold space with a simplified model
we probe the stability and near native energy landscape of protein fold space using powerful conformational sampling methods together with simple reduced models and statistical potentials fold space is represented by a set of   protein domains spanning all topological classes and having a wide range of lengths      residues amino acid composition and number of secondary structural elements the degrees of freedom are taken as the loop torsion angles this choice preserves the native secondary structure but allows the tertiary structure to change the proteins are represented by three point per residue three dimensional models with statistical potentials derived from a knowledge based study of known protein structures when this space is sampled by a combination of parallel tempering and equi energy monte carlo we find that the three point model captures the known stability of protein native structures with stable energy basins that are near native all        all                        on average and within    for            and    for all   all      and    classes respectively  denatured structures also occur and these have interesting structural properties that shed light on the different landscape characteristics of  and  folds we find that    proteins with alternating  and  segments such as the  barrel are more stable than proteins in other fold classes
