mechanistic asymmetry in hsp  dimers
hsp  is a molecular chaperone that facilitates the maturation of signaling proteins including many kinases and steroid hormone receptors through these client proteins hsp  is a key mediator of many physiological processes and has emerged as a promising drug target in cancer additionally hsp  can mask or potentiate the impact of mutations in clients with remarkable influence on evolutionary adaptations the influential roles of hsp  in biology and disease have stimulated extensive research into the molecular mechanism of this chaperone these studies have shown that hsp  is a homodimeric protein that requires atp hydrolysis and a host of accessory proteins termed co chaperones to facilitate the maturation of clients to their active states flexible hinge regions between its three structured domains enable hsp  to sample dramatically distinct conformations that are influenced by nucleotide client and co chaperone binding while it is clear that hsp  can exist in symmetrical conformations recent studies have indicated that this homodimeric chaperone can also assume a variety of asymmetric conformations and complexes that are important for client maturation the visualization of hsp  client complexes at high resolution together with tools to independently manipulate each subunit in the hsp  dimer are providing new insights into the asymmetric function of each subunit during client maturation
