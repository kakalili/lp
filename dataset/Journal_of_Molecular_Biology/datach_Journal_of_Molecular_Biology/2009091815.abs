syncytin  plays an important role in the fusion of human trophoblast cells
human endogenous retrovirus herv encoded syncytin  has been suggested to play a major role in trophoblast cell fusion and thereby placenta development however recent studies have strongly suggested that other herv envelope proteins could also be implicated in this process based on this premise herein we compared the expression and functional implication of syncytin  with the more recently described syncytin  protein in various trophoblast cells real time reverse transcription pcr and western blot analyses in differentiating primary trophoblast cells first indicated a direct correlation between mrna and protein levels of syncytin  and cell fusion while an inverse correlation for syncytin  was noted similar reverse transcription pcr experiments and promoter studies showed that cell fusion inducing agents in the trophoblastic bewo cell line increased the expression of syncytin  but more importantly augmented syncytin  expression confocal microscopy experiments further revealed that in bewo cells and in freshly isolated primary human trophoblast cells syncytin  was present as a cytoplasmic punctuated structure in proximity to regions of cell to cell contact on the other hand syncytin  presented an inducible signal which mainly localized to the cytoplasmic membrane experiments with sirna small interfering rna transfected bewo and primary human trophoblast cells demonstrated an important diminution in the number of cell fusion events upon repression of syncytin  expression whereas transfection experiments with syncytin  specific sirna resulted in a more modest effect overall these results highlight the importance of syncytin  in bewo and primary human trophoblast cell fusion
