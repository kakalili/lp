snapshots of protein folding a study on the multiple transition state pathway of cytochrome c  from pseudomonas aeruginosa edited by c r matthews
cytochrome c   cyt c   from pseudomonas aeruginosa is a small protein   residues that folds via a three state pathway with the accumulation in the microsecond time range of a compact collapsed intermediate the presence of a single his residue at position   permits the study of the refolding at ph   in the absence of miscoordination events here we report on folding kinetics in the millisecond time range as a function of urea under different ph conditions analysis of this process over and above proline cis trans isomerization at ph   suggests the existence of a multiple transition state pathway in which we postulate three transition states taking advantage of site directed mutagenesis we propose that the first  unfolded like  transition state t  originates from the electrostatic properties of the collapsed state while the second transition state t  involves the interaction between the n and c terminal helices and is stabilized by the salt bridge between lys  and glu     kcal mol    our results suggest that contrary to other cytochromes c the roll over effect observed for cyt c  at low denaturant concentration can be interpreted in terms of a broad energy barrier without population of any intermediates the third and more  native like  transition state m can be associated with the breaking formation of the fe  met  bond this strong interaction is stabilized by the hydrogen bond between trp  and heme propionate   hp   as suggested by the increase in the unfolding rate at high denaturant concentration of the trp phe site directed mutant
