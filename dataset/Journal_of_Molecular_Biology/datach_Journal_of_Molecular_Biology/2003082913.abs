dna polymerase  can incorporate ribonucleotides during dna synthesis of undamaged and cpd damaged dna
overexpression of the error prone dna polymerase   pol   has been found to increase spontaneous mutagenesis by competing with the replicative polymerases during dna replication here we investigate an additional mechanism potentially used by pol  to enhance genetic instability via its ability to incorporate ribonucleotides into dna by using an in vitro primer extension assay we show that purified human and calf thymus pol  can synthesize up to  mer long rna moreover pol  can efficiently incorporate rctp opposite g in the absence of dctp and to a lesser extent ratp opposite t in the absence of datp and rgtp opposite c in the absence of dgtp recently pol  was shown to catalyze in vitro translesion replication of a thymine cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer cpd  here we investigate if ribonucleotides could be incorporated opposite the cpd damage and modulate the efficiency of the bypass process we find that all four rntps can be incorporated opposite the cpd lesion and that this process affects translesion synthesis we discuss how incorporation of ribonucleotides into dna may contribute to the high frequency of mutagenesis observed in pol  up regulating cells
