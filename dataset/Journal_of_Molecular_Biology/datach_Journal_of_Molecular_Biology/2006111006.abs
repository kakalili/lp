mutational analysis of   region  needed for appropriation by the bacteriophage t transcription factors asia and mota
transcriptional activation of bacteriophage t middle promoters requires   containing escherichia coli rna polymerase the t activator mota and the t co activator asia t middle promoters contain the      dna element however these promoters lack the      element having instead a mota box centered at    which is bound by mota previous work has indicated that asia and mota interact with region  of    the c terminal portion that normally contacts    dna and the  flap structure in core asia binding prevents the     flap and      dna interactions inhibiting transcription from promoters that require a    element to test the importance of residues within   region  for mota and asia function we investigated how   region  mutants interact with asia mota and the  flap and function in transcription assays in vitro we find that alanine substitutions at residues      region   do not impair the interaction of region  with the  flap or mota but they eliminate the interaction with asia and prevent asia inhibition and mota asia activation in contrast alanine substitutions at          region   eliminate the region   flap interaction significantly impair the asia   interaction and eliminate asia inhibition however the   mutant   is still fully competent for activation if both mota and asia are present a previous nmr structure shows asia binding to   region  dramatically distorting regions   and   and indirectly changing the conformation of the mota interaction site at the   c terminus our analyses provide biochemical relevance for the   residues identified in the structure indicate that the interaction of asia with   region   is crucial for activation and support the idea that asia binding facilitates an interaction between mota and the far c terminus of
