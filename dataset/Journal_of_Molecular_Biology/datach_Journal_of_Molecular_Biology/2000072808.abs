human genome search in celiac disease using gliadin cdna as probe edited by j karn
celiac disease is a wheat gliadin promoted disorder that displays a complex genetic susceptibility associated with hla dq  and one or more unknown factor s  possibly gliadin like the presence of mammalian proteins with partial gliadin similarity was suggested by transglutaminase independent multi tissue reactivity of gliadin immunopurified antibodies from celiac patients no non plant sequence however was identified in gliadin peptide epitope searches of non redundant and est databanks via tblastn blastp and fasta even at e values as high as   therefore an  gliadin cdna screen of human cdna and genomic libraries was undertaken an approach in keeping with positive human northern and southern analyses with the same probe four distinct cdna clones were obtained the most stringent of which   and   kb were novel and featured potential open reading frames with high gliadin domain ii and domain iv homologies bestfit quality scores    and   respectively versus random value      both were also homologous to ests an additional   gliadin oligonucleotide screen identified the widely distributed cytoplasmic protein acyl coa hydrolase whose homology was restricted to the oligonucleotide probe bestfit quality   versus   for random  and achaete scute homologous protein which displays particularly high gliadin domain ii homology bestfit quality   versus   for random  genomic screening uncovered  positives one of which was the alr gene whose similarity to three of gliadin  s five domains i ii and iv bestfit quality     versus     for random was remarkable more extensive was novel genomic clone  with fragments hybridizing to cdna probes approximating gliadin domains i ii iv v and the gliadin   untranslated region and mapping by fish to  q       two fragments were sequenced one was exonic as predicted by four different programs and test oligonucleotides suggested widespread  and or  kb mrna expression even at high stringency tm    deg c  taken together it is apparent that several genes with partial gliadin homology exist in the human genome many bear gliadin like t cell epitopes are expressed in intestine and like transglutaminase are cytoplasmic glutamine to glutamic acid or other mutation within such epitopes followed by injury or infection related release could explain enhanced disease susceptibility in affected families
