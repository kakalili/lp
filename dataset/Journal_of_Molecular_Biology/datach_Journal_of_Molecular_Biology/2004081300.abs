crystal structure of the   kda homotetrameric lignin degrading enzyme pyranose  oxidase
pyranose  oxidase p ox is a   kda homotetramer localized preferentially in the hyphal periplasmic space of lignocellulolytic fungi and has a proposed role in lignocellulose degradation to produce the essential co substrate hydrogen peroxide for lignin peroxidases p ox oxidizes d glucose and other aldopyranoses regioselectively at c to the corresponding  keto sugars however for some substrates the enzyme also displays specificity for oxidation at c  the crystal structure of p ox from trametes multicolor has been determined using single anomalous dispersion with mercury as anomalous scatterer the model was refined at    resolution to r and rfree values of    and    respectively the overall fold of the p ox subunit resembles that of members of the glucose  methanol  choline family of long chain oxidoreductases featuring a flavin binding rossmann domain of class    and a substrate binding subdomain with a six stranded central  sheet and three  helices the homotetramer buries a large internal cavity of roughly      from which the four active sites are accessible four solvent channels lead from the surface into the cavity through which substrate must enter before accessing the active site the present structure shows an acetate molecule bound in the active site with the carboxylate group positioned immediately below the flavin n atom and with one carboxylate oxygen atom interacting with the catalytic residues his  and asn   the entrance to the active site is blocked by a loop residues   to   with excellent electron density but elevated temperature factors we predict that this loop is dynamic and opens to allow substrate entry and exit in silico docking of d glucose in the p ox active site shows that with the active site loop in the closed conformation monosaccharides cannot be accommodated however after removing the loop from the model a tentative set of protein  substrate interactions for  d glucose have been outlined
