the bipolar filaments formed by herpes simplex virus type  ssb recombination protein icp  suggest a mechanism for dna annealing
herpes simplex virus type  encodes a multifunctional protein icp  which serves both as a single strand binding protein and as a recombinase catalyzing reactions involved in replication and recombination of the viral genome in the presence of divalent ions and at low temperature previous electron microscopic studies showed that icp will form long left handed helical filaments here electron microscopic image reconstruction reveals that the filaments are bipolar with an asymmetric unit containing two subunits of icp that constitute a symmetrical dimer this organization of the filament has been confirmed using scanning transmission electron microscopy the pitch of the filaments is       with    dimers per turn docking of a crystal structure of icp into the reconstructed filament shows that the c terminal domain of icp  attached to the body of the subunit by a flexible linker containing    residues is packed into a pocket in the body of a neighboring subunit in the crystal in a similar manner as in the filament however the interactions between the large n terminal domains are quite different in the filament from that observed in the crystal a previously proposed model for icp binding single stranded dna ssdna  based upon the crystal structure leads to a model for a continuous strand of ssdna near the filament axis the bipolar nature of the icp filaments means that a second strand of ssdna would be running through this filament in the opposite orientation and this provides a potential mechanism for how icp anneals complementary ssdna into double stranded dna where each strand runs in opposite directions
