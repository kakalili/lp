solution state nmr structure and dynamics of kpompa a   residue transmembrane domain possessing a high potential for immunological applications
the three dimensional structure of the outer membrane protein a from klebsiella pneumoniae transmembrane domain was determined by nmr this protein induces specific humoral and cytotoxic responses and is a potent carrier protein this is one of the largest integral membrane proteins   residues for which nearly complete resonance assignment including side chains has been achieved so far the methodology rested on the use of   mhz d and d trosy experiments recorded on a uniformly  n  c h labeled sample and on a perdeuterated methyl protonated sample the structure was refined from   experimental constraints giving an ensemble of  best structures with an r m s deviation of     for the main chain atoms in the core eight stranded  barrel the protein dynamics was assessed in a residue specific manner by h  n noes pico to nanosecond timescale  exchange broadening millisecond to second and h h chemical exchange hour weeks
