the effect of increasing the stability of non native interactions on the folding landscape of the bacterial immunity protein im
how stabilising non native interactions influence protein folding energy landscapes is currently not well understood such interactions could speed folding by reducing the conformational search to the native state or could slow folding by increasing ruggedness here we examine the influence of non native interactions in the folding process of the bacterial immunity protein im  by exploiting our ability to manipulate the stability of the intermediate and rate limiting transition state ts in the folding of this protein by minor alteration of its sequence or changes in solvent conditions by analysing the properties of these species using  value analysis and exploration of the structural properties of the ts ensemble using molecular dynamics simulations we demonstrate the importance of non native interactions in immunity protein folding and demonstrate that the rate limiting step involves partial reorganisation of these interactions as the ts ensemble is traversed moreover we show that increasing the contribution to stability made by non native interactions results in an increase in  values of the ts ensemble without altering its structural properties or solvent accessible surface area the data suggest that the immunity proteins fold on multiple but closely related micropathways resulting in a heterogeneous ts ensemble that responds subtly to mutation or changes in the solvent conditions thus altering the relative strength of native and non native interactions influences the search to the native state by restricting the pathways through the folding energy landscape
