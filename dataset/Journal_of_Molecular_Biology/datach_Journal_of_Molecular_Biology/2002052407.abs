mechanisms of metal ion action in tn  transposition
tn  is  transposition involves assembly of a synaptic complex or transpososome in which two transposon ends are paired followed by four distinct chemical steps at each transposon end the chemical steps are dependent on the presence of a suitable divalent metal cation me   transpososome assembly and structure are also affected by me  to gain further insight into the mechanisms of me  action in tn  is  transposition we have investigated the effects of substituting mn  for mg  the physiologic me  in transposition we have also investigated the significance of an me  assisted conformational change in transpososome structure we show that mn  has two previously unrecognized effects on the tn  donor cleavage reaction it accelerates the rates of hairpin formation and hairpin resolution without significantly affecting the rate of the first chemical step first strand nicking mn  also relaxes the specificity of first strand nicking we also show that me  assisted transpososome unfolding coincides with a structural transition in the transposon  donor junction that may be necessary for hairpin formation possible mechanisms for these observations are considered
