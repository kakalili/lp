structure and dynamics of a stabilized coiled coil domain in the p tefb regulator hexim
the positive transcription elongation factor p tefb mediates the transition from transcription initiation to productive elongation by phosphorylation of the c terminal domain of rna polymerase ii p tefb is negatively regulated by the cellular protein hexim  hexamethylene bisacetamide inducible protein   which is highly conserved in higher eukaryotes the c terminal coiled coil domain of hexim recognizes the cyclin t subunit of p tefb whereas a central pynt motif is required to inhibit the cyclin dependent kinase cdk by a yet unknown mechanism here the crystal structure of the cyclin t binding domain tbd of human hexim was determined at     resolution using a deletion mutant of three residues in its central stammer motif the structure showed a continuous parallel coiled coil domain of nine hepta repeats with a preceding helix encompassing up to  residues two uncommon residues at heptad a positions in the n terminal part of the coiled coil structure lys  and tyr   stabilize the preceding helix by a tight intermolecular hydrogen bond network with residues of the opposing chain these interactions delineate a characteristic turn between both helices that is supposed to mediate binding to cyclin t  stabilization of the coiled coil domain by deletion of the stammer region was confirmed by nmr spectroscopic and backbone dynamic analyses analyzing wild type tbd and three mutant variants this study thus provides structural insights into the recognition of the regulator protein hexim by p tefb and the modulation of coiled coil dynamics by specific discontinuities
