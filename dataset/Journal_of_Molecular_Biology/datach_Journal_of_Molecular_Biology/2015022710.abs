filament assembly by spire key residues and concerted actin binding
the most recently identified class of actin nucleators wasp homology domain  wh  nucleators use tandem repeats of monomeric actin binding wh domains to facilitate actin nucleation wh domains are involved in a wide variety of actin regulatory activities structurally they are expected to clash with interprotomer contacts within the actin filament thus the discovery of their role in nucleation was surprising here we use drosophila spire spir as a model system to investigate both how tandem wh domains can nucleate actin and what differentiates nucleating wh containing proteins from their non nucleating counterparts we found that the third wh domain in spir spir c or sc plays a unique role in the context of a short nucleation construct containing only two wh domains  placement of sc in the n terminal position was required for the most potent nucleation we found that the native organization of the wh domains with respect to each other is necessary for binding to actin with positive cooperativity we identified two residues within sc that are critical for its activity using this information we were able to convert a weak synthetic nucleator into one with activity equal to a native spir construct lastly we found evidence that sc binds actin filaments in addition to monomers
