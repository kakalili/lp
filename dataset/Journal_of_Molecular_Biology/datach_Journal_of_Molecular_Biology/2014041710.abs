molecular insights into the recognition of n terminal histone modifications by the brpf bromodomain
the monocytic leukemic zinc finger moz histone acetyltransferase hat acetylates free histones h  h  h a and h b in vitro and is associated with up regulation of gene transcription the moz hat functions as a quaternary complex with the bromodomain phd finger protein  brpf  inhibitor of growth  ing  and heaf subunits brpf links the moz catalytic subunit to the ing and heaf subunits thereby promoting moz hat activity human brpf contains multiple effector domains with known roles in gene transcription as well as chromatin binding and remodeling however the biological function of the brpf bromodomain remains unknown our findings reveal novel interactions of the brpf bromodomain with multiple acetyllysine residues on the n terminus of histones and show that it preferentially selects for h ak ac h k ac and h k ac we used chemical shift perturbation data from nmr titration experiments to map the brpf bromodomain ligand binding pocket and identified key residues responsible for coordination of the post translationally modified histones extensive molecular dynamics simulations were used to generate structural models of bromodomain  histone ligand complexes to analyze hydrogen bonding and other interactions and to calculate the binding free energies our results outline the molecular mechanism driving binding specificity of the brpf bromodomain for discrete acetyllysine residues on the n terminal histone tails together these data provide insights into how histone recognition by the bromodomain directs the biological function of brpf  ultimately targeting the moz hat complex to chromatin substrates
