regulator of calcineurin rcan  regulates thermotaxis behavior in caenorhabditiselegans
regulator of calcineurin rcan is a calcineurin interacting protein that inhibits calcineurin phosphatase when overexpressed often upregulated under neuropathological conditions with impaired learning and memory processes such as down syndrome or alzheimer s disease thermotactic behavior in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans is a form of memory in which calcineurin signaling plays a pivotal role in the thermosensation of afd neurons in this study we found that rcan  deletion mutants exhibited cryophilic behavior dependent on tax  which was rescued by expressing rcan  in afd neurons interaction between rcan  and tax  requires the conserved pxixit motif of rcan  without which thermotactic behavior could not be fully rescued in addition the loss of crh  creb suppressed the thermotaxis phenotypes of rcan  and tax  mutants indicating that crh  is crucial in thermotaxis memory in these mutants taken together our results suggest that rcan  is an inhibitory regulator of tax  and that it acts in the formation of thermosensory behavioral memory in c elegans
