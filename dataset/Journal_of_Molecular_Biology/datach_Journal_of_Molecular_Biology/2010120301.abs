alternative oligomeric states of the yeast rvb rvb complex induced by histidine tags
rvb and rvb are essential aaa  atpases associated with diverse cellular activities helicases which are important components of critical complexes such as chromatin remodeling and telomerase complexes the oligomeric state of the rvb proteins has been controversial independent studies from several groups have described the yeast and human rvb rvb complex both as a single and as a double hexameric ring complex we found that histidine tagged constructs of yeast rvb proteins employed in some of these studies induced the assembly of double hexameric ring rvb rvb complexes instead untagged versions of these proteins assemble into single hexameric rings furthermore purified endogenous untagged rvb rvb complexes from saccharomyces cerevisiae were also found as single hexameric rings similar to the complexes assembled in vitro from the purified untagged components these results demonstrate that some of the differences between the reported structures are caused by histidine tags and imply that further studies on the purified proteins should be carried out using untagged constructs
