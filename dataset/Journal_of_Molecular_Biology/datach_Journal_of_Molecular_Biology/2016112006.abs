crystal structure of a complex of the intracellular domain of interferon  receptor  ifnlr  and the ferm sh domains of human jak
the crystal structure of a construct consisting of the ferm and sh like domains of the human janus kinase  jak  bound to a fragment of the intracellular domain of the interferon  receptor  ifnlr  has been determined at the nominal resolution of    in this structure the receptor peptide forms an    long extended chain in which both the previously identified box and box regions bind simultaneously to the ferm and sh like domains of jak  both domains of jak are generally well ordered with regions not seen in the crystal structure limited to loops located away from the receptor binding regions the structure provides a much more complete and accurate picture of the interactions between jak and ifnlr than those given in earlier reports illuminating the molecular basis of the jak  cytokine receptor association a glutamate residue adjacent to the box region in ifnlr mimics the mode of binding of a phosphotyrosine in classical sh domains it was shown here that a deletion of residues within the box region of the receptor abolishes stable interactions with jak  although it was previously shown that box alone is sufficient to stabilize a similar complex of the interferon  receptor and tyk
