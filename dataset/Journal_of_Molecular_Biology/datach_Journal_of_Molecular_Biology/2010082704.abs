biophysical characterisation of fibulin  proteins associated with disease
fbln encodes fibulin  an extracellular matrix calcium binding glycoprotein that is essential for elastic fibre formation fbln mutations are associated with two distinct human diseases age related macular degeneration amd and cutis laxa cl  but the biochemical basis for the pathogenic effects of these mutations is poorly understood two missense mutations found in amd patients i  t and g  s and two missense mutations found in cl patients g  r and s  p were analysed in a native like context in recombinant fibulin  fragments limited proteolysis nmr spectroscopy and chromophoric calcium chelation experiments showed that the g  s and s  p substitutions cause long range structural effects consistent with protein misfolding cellular studies using fibroblast cells further demonstrated that these recombinant forms of mutant fibulin  were not present in the extracellular medium consistent with retention in contrast no significant effects of i  t and g  r substitutions on protein fold and secretion were identified these data establish protein misfolding as a causative basis for the effects of g  s and s  p substitutions in amd and cl respectively and raise the possibility that the i  t and g  r substitutions may be polymorphisms or may increase susceptibility to disease
