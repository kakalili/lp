structure guided directed evolution of highly selective p  based magnetic resonance imaging sensors for dopamine and serotonin
new tools that allow dynamic visualization of molecular neural events are important for studying the basis of brain activity and disease sensors that permit ligand sensitive magnetic resonance imaging mri are useful reagents due to the noninvasive nature and good temporal and spatial resolution of mr methods paramagnetic metalloproteins can be effective mri sensors due to the selectivity imparted by the protein active site and the ability to tune protein properties using techniques such as directed evolution here we show that structure guided directed evolution of the active site of the cytochrome p   bm heme domain produces highly selective mri probes with submicromolar affinities for small molecules we report a new high  affinity dopamine sensor as well as the first mri reporter for serotonin with which we demonstrate quantification of neurotransmitter release in vitro we also present a detailed structural analysis of evolved cytochrome p   bm heme domain lineages to systematically dissect the molecular basis of neurotransmitter binding affinity selectivity and enhanced mri contrast activity in these engineered proteins
