stable binding of human xpc complex to irradiated dna confers strong discrimination for damaged sites edited by m yaniv
nucleotide excision repair ner of dna damage requires an efficient means of discrimination between damaged and non damaged dna cells from humans with xeroderma pigmentosum group c do not perform ner in the bulk of the genome and are corrected by xpc protein which forms a complex with hhr b protein this complex preferentially binds to some types of damaged dna but the extent of discrimination in comparison to other ner proteins has not been clear recombinant xpc hhr b and xpc hhr b complex were purified in a reconstituted repair system hhr b stimulated xpc activity tenfold electrophoretic mobility shift competition measurements revealed a   fold preference for binding of xpc hhr b to uv damaged over non damaged dna this damage preference is much greater than displayed by the xpa protein the discrimination power is similar to that determined here in parallel for the xp e factor uv ddb despite the considerably greater molar affinity of uv ddb for dna binding of xpc hhr b to uv damaged dna was very fast damaged dna xpc hhr b complexes were stable with half of the complexes remaining four hours after challenge with excess uv damaged dna at   c xpc hhr b had a higher level of affinity for    photoproducts than cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and some affinity for dna treated with cisplatin and alkylating agents xpc hhr b could bind to single stranded m  dna but only poorly to single stranded homopolymers the strong preference of xpc complex for structures in damaged duplex dna indicates its importance as a primary damage recognition factor in non transcribed dna during human ner
