crystallographic and energetic analysis of binding of selected anions to the yellow variants of green fluorescent protein edited by d c rees
the fluorescence emission of yellow fluorescent proteins yfps has been shown to respond rapidly and reversibly to changes in the concentration of some small anions such as halides this allows for the use of yfps as genetically encodable cl  sensors that may be targeted to specific organelles in living cells fluorescence is suppressed due to protonation of the chromophore upon anion binding with a stronger level of interaction at low ph values at ph   the apparent dissociation constant kapp for cl  is  mm for yfp and  mm for yfp h  q whereas at ph   kapp is   mm and   mm respectively in the cytosol yfp h  q appears most promising as a halide sensor due to its high degree of sensitivity towards i   kapp   mm at ph    to aid in the design of variants with improved levels of specificity and affinity for cl   we solved apo and i  bound crystal structures of yfp h  q to    resolution the halide binding site is found near van der waals contact with the chromophore imidazolinone oxygen atom in a small buried cavity adjacent to arg  which provides electrostatic stabilization the halide ion is hydrogen bonded to the phenol group of t  y consistent with a mutational analysis that indicates that t  y is indispensible for tight binding a series of conformational changes occurs in the amphiphilic site upon anion binding which appear to be propagated to the  bulge region around residue   on the protein surface anion binding raises the chromophore pka values since delocalization of the phenolate negative charge over the chromophore skeleton is suppressed extraction of microscopic binding constants for the linked equilibrium between anion and proton binding indicates that anion selectivity by yfp is related to hydration forces specific suggestions to improve cl  binding to yfp h  q based on size and hydration energy are proposed
