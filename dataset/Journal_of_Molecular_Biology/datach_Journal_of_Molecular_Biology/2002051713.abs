structural mimicry of proline kinks tertiary packing interactions support local structural distortions
proline residues in the helical segments of soluble and transmembrane proteins have received special attention from both a structural and functional perspective a feature of these helices is the structural distortion termed  proline kink   which has been associated with the presence of the proline residue however a recent report on the yeast heat shock transcription factor of kluyveromyces lactis hsf kl suggests that these proline associated deformations can be achieved in the absence of proline residues thus raising the question of the mechanisms responsible for the structural mimicry of proline related features in this study the specific interactions responsible for the distortion were characterized by comparative analysis of the atomic details of the packing interactions that surround the evolutionarily conserved proline kink in the   helix of hsf kl and a set of  structurally related proteins that lacked the distortion the mechanistic details inferred from this analysis were confirmed with molecular dynamics simulations the study shows that the packing interactions between the   and   helices in hsf kl are responsible for the stabilization of the conserved kink whether a proline residue that divides the helix into segments is present or not the proline kink can facilitate the formation of tertiary packing interactions that would otherwise not be possible however it is the ability to establish differential packing interactions for the helix segments rather than the structural properties of the proline kink itself that emerges as the key factor for the characteristic distortion
