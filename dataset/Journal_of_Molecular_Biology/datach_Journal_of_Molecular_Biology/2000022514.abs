solution structure of an  mer duplex containing the  n ethenocytosine adduct opposite   deoxycytidine implications for the recognition of exocyclic lesions by dna glycosylases edited by i tinoco
lipid peroxidation products as well as the metabolic products of vinyl chloride react with cellular dna producing the mutagenic adduct  n etheno   deoxycytidine  dc  along with several other exocyclic derivatives high resolution nmr spectroscopy and restrained molecular dynamics simulations were used to establish the solution structure of an  mer duplex containing an  dc dc base pair at its center the nmr data suggested a regular right handed helical structure having all residues in the anti orientation around the glycosydic torsion angle and watson crick alignments for all canonical base pairs of the duplex restrained molecular dynamics generated a three dimensional model in excellent agreement with the spectroscopic data the  dc dc duplex structure is a regular right handed helix with a slight bend at the lesion site and no severe distortions of the sugar phosphate backbone the  dc adduct and its partner dc were displaced towards opposite grooves of the helix resulting in a lesion containing base pair that was highly sheared but stabilized to some degree by the formation of a single hydrogen bond such a sheared base pair alignment at the lesion site was previously observed for  dc dg and  dc t duplexes and was also present in the crystal structures of duplexes containing dg t and dg u mismatches these observations suggest the existence of a substrate structural motif that may be recognized by specific dna glycosylases during the process of base excision repair
