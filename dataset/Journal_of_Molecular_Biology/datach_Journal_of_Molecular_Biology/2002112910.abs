specific damage induced by x ray radiation and structural changes in the primary photoreaction of bacteriorhodopsin
bacteriorhodopsin the sole membrane protein of the purple membrane of halobacterium salinarum functions as a light driven proton pump a  d crystal of bacteriorhodopsin which was prepared by the membrane fusion method was used to investigate structural changes in the primary photoreaction it was observed that when a frozen crystal was exposed to a low flux of x ray radiation     photonsmm    nearly half of the protein was converted into an orange species exhibiting absorption peaks at  nm   nm and  nm the remainder retained the normal photochemical activity until asp  in the active site was decarboxlyated by a higher flux of x ray radiation   photonsmm    the procedure of diffraction measurement was improved so as to minimize the effects of the radiation damage and determine the true structural change associated with the primary photoreaction our structural model of the k intermediate indicates that the schiff base linkage and the adjacent bonds in the polyene chain of retinal are largely twisted so that the schiff base nitrogen atom still interacts with a water molecule located near asp  with respect to the other part of the protein no appreciable displacement is induced in the primary photoreaction
