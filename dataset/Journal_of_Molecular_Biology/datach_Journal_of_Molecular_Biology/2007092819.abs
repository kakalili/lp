reconstitution of the mitochondrial prxiii antioxidant defence pathway general properties and factors affecting prxiii activity and oligomeric state
the mitochondrial  cys peroxiredoxin prxiii serves as a thioredoxin dependent peroxidase operating in tandem with its cognate partners an organelle specific thioredoxin trx  and nadp linked thioredoxin reductase trr  this prxiii pathway is emerging as a primary regulator of intracellular h o levels with dual roles in antioxidant defence and h o mediated signalling here we describe the reconstitution of the mammalian prxiii pathway in vitro from its purified recombinant components and investigate some of its overall properties employing the site directed prxiii mutants c s c s and c  s the putative n and c terminal catalytic cysteine residues are shown to be essential for function whereas the c s mutant retains full activity the pathway attains maximal capacity at low h o concentrations  lt    m and is progressively inhibited in the range   mm to   mm peroxide damage to prxiii caused by over oxidation is confirmed by the appearance of abnormal oxidised species of prxiii on sds  page at elevated h o levels the presence of an n terminal his tag on prxiii markedly enhances dodecamer stability particularly apparent in its oxidised state its removal promotes oxidised prxiii dissociation into dimers and leads to a      fold stimulation in peroxidase activity the unusual concatenated crystal structure of prxiii consisting of two interlocked dodecameric rings is also evident in dilute solution employing transmission electron microscopy however it represents only    of the population with most molecules present as single toroids moreover concatenated prxiii c  s reverts to single toroids on crystal dissolution indicating that these higher order structures are produced dynamically during the crystallisation process
