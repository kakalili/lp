kinetic and mechanistic analysis of the rna polymerase ii transcription reaction at the human interleukin  promoter edited by k yamamoto
interleukin  il  is a cytokine critical for the proper stimulation of t cells during the mammalian immune response shortly after t cell stimulation transcription of the il  gene is upregulated here we studied the kinetic mechanism of basal transcription at the il  promoter using a human in vitro rna polymerase ii transcription system we experimentally divided the transcription reaction into discrete steps including preinitiation complex formation initiation escape commitment and promoter escape using pre steady state approaches we measured the rate at which each of these steps occurs we found that the rate of functional preinitiation complex formation limits the overall rate of transcription at the il  promoter under the conditions described here furthermore we found that the recruitment of tfiif and rna polymerase ii to a tfiid tfiia tfiib promoter complex dictates the rate of preinitiation complex formation the rate of synthesis of  nt rna from preinitiation complexes was rapid compared to the rate of preinitiation complex formation moreover we found that the synthesis of a four nucleotide rna was necessary and sufficient to rapidly complete the escape commitment step of transcription at the il  promoter comparative experiments with the adenovirus major late promoter revealed that while the overall mechanism of transcription is the same at the two promoters promoter sequence and or architecture dictate the rate of promoter escape we present a kinetic model for a single round of basal transcription at the il  promoter that provides insight into mechanisms by which the il  gene is transcriptionally regulated
