factors influencing compact  extended structure equilibrium in oligomers of a     peptide  an ion mobility mass spectrometry study
oligomers formed by amyloid   a  peptide are widely believed to be the main neurotoxic agent in alzheimer s disease studies discovered a broad variety of oligomeric forms which display different levels of toxicity some of these forms may further assemble into mature fibrils while other might be off pathway from conversion to fibrils and assemble into alternative forms to better understand a relationship between the structure and toxicity of a  oligomers we require systematic characterization and classification of all possible forms facilitating rational design of the beneficial modifiers of their activity in previous ion mobility analysis of a     oligomers we have detected the coexistence of two alternative structural forms compact and extended in a pool of low order a     oligomers these forms may represent two pathways of the oligomer evolution leading either to fibrils or to off pathway oligomers which are potential candidates for the neurotoxic species here we have analyzed the impact of incubation time the presence of selected metal ions and the effect of a series of point mutations on mutual population of alternative forms we have shown that a salt bridge d k  provides stabilization of the compact form whereas g  is required for the existence of the extended form we have found that binding of metal ions also stabilizes the compact form these results improve our understanding of the possible molecular mechanism of the bifurcation of structural evolution of non monomeric a  species into an off fibril pathway ultimately leading to the formation of potentially neurotoxic species
