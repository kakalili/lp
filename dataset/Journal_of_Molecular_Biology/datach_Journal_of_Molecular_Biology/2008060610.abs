dissection of the bacteriophage t late promoter complex
activated transcription of the bacteriophage t late genes is generated by a mechanism that stands apart from the common modalities of transcriptional regulation the activator is gp  the viral replisome s sliding clamp two sliding clamp binding proteins gp  and gp  replace the host rna polymerase rnap   subunit we have mutagenized reconfigured and selectively disrupted individual interactions of the sliding clamp with gp  and gp  and have monitored effects on transcription the c terminal sliding clamp binding epitopes of gp  and gp  are perfectly interchangeable but the functions of these two rnap  sliding clamp connections differ only the gp   gp  linkage is essential for activation while loss of the gp   gp  linkage impairs but does not abolish activation formation of transcription ready promoter complexes by the sliding clamp activated wild type t rnap resists competition by high concentrations of the polyanion heparin this avid formation of promoter complexes requires both linkages of the t late rnap to the sliding clamp preopening the promoter compensates for loss of the gp   gp  but not the gp   gp  linkage we interpret the relationship of these findings and our prior analysis to the common model of transcriptional initiation in bacteria in terms of two parallel pathways with two rnap holoenzymes and two dna templates   gp   rnap and the t late promoter execute basal transcription   gp   gp   rnap and the t late promoter with its mobile enhancer the t sliding clamp execute activated transcription gp  and gp  perform  like functions gp  in promoter recognition and gp  as well as gp  in enhancer recognition gp  operates the switch between these two pathways by repressing basal transcription
