crystal structure of lactose synthase reveals a large conformational change in its catalytic component the    galactosyltransferase i edited by r huber
the lactose synthase ls enzyme is a   complex of a catalytic component    galactosyltransferse   gal t  and a regulatory component   lactalbumin la  a mammary gland specific protein la promotes the binding of glucose glc to  gal t  thereby altering its sugar acceptor specificity from n acetylglucosamine glcnac to glucose which enables ls to synthesize lactose the major carbohydrate component of milk the crystal structures of ls bound with various substrates were solved at   resolution these structures reveal that upon substrate binding to  gal t  a large conformational change occurs in the region comprising residues   to   this repositions his  in such a way that it can participate in the coordination of a metal ion and creates a sugar and la binding site at the sugar acceptor binding site a hydrophobic n acetyl group binding pocket is found formed by residues arg   phe  and ile   in the glc bound structure this hydrophobic pocket is absent for the binding of glc to ls a reorientation of the arg  side chain occurs which blocks the hydrophobic pocket and maximizes the interactions with the glc molecule thus the role of la is to hold glc by hydrogen bonding with the o  hydroxyl group in the acceptor binding site on  gal t  while the n acetyl group binding pocket in  gal t adjusts to maximize the interactions with the glc molecule this study provides details of a structural basis for the partially ordered kinetic mechanism proposed for lactose synthase
