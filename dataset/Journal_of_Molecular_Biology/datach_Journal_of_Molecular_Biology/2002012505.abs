determining the differences in actin binding by human adf and cofilin edited by j karn
the actin depolymerizing factor adf cofilin family of proteins play an essential role in actin dynamics and cytoskeletal re organization human tissues express two isoforms in the same cells adf and cofilin and these two proteins are more than   identical in amino acid sequence we show that adf is a much more potent actin depolymerizing agent than cofilin the maximum level of depolymerization at ph  by adf is about   m compared to   m for cofilin but little depolymerization occurs at ph   with either protein however we find little difference between the two proteins in their binding to filaments their severing activities or their activation of subunit release from the pointed ends of filaments likewise they show no significant differences in their affinities for monomeric actin both bind  fold more tightly to actin adp than to actin atp complexes between actin adp and adf or cofilin associate with both barbed and pointed ends of filaments at similar rates close to those of actin atp and much higher than those of actin adp  this explains why high concentrations of both proteins reverse the activation of subunit release at pointed ends the major difference between the two proteins is that the nucleating activity of cofilin actin adp complexes is twice that of adf actin adp complexes and this in turn is twice that of actin atp alone it is this weaker nucleating potential of adf actin adp that accounts for the much higher steady state depolymerizing activity the ph sensitivity is due to the nucleating activity of complexes being greater at ph   than at ph  sequence analysis of mammalian and avian isoforms shows a consistent pattern of charge differences in regions of the protein associated with f actin binding that may account for the differences in activity between adf and cofilin
