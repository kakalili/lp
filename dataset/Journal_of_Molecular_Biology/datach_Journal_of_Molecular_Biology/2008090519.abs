a mechanistic insight into smac peptide interference with xiap bir inhibition of executioner caspases
x linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein xiap inhibits apoptosis mainly through inhibition of caspase  and executioner caspases of  and   the inhibition of the former protease is implemented through the bacculoviral inhibitory repeat  bir  domain while the inhibition of the latter is accomplished by the interaction of the linker region located between the bir and the bir domains with their active sites both modes of inhibition are antagonized by smac which is released from mitochondria during the initiation of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway although the mechanism of smac interference in bir inhibition of caspase  is clearly established the mechanism by which smac interferes with the inhibition of the executioner caspases by xiap remains largely unknown to address this issue we performed a limited proteolysis of glutathione s transferase gst tagged xiap bir by trypsin in the presence and in the absence of smac peptide under these conditions the proteolysis of the linker region was diminished considerably furthermore the rate of association of caspase  and  with xiap in the presence of the smac peptide was reduced drastically suggesting that smac peptide restricts the exposure of the linker region a limited proteolysis of caspase  in the presence of gst bir and gst nbir  the bir domain of human naip as negative controls was also performed matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight analysis of the fragments revealed the identity of protected sites suggesting that the bir domain makes numerous contacts with the large subunit of caspase  these combined with the results from far western experiments strongly suggest that the groove for the inhibitor s of apoptosis protein binding motif on the bir favors binding to the n terminus of the large subunit rather than to the small subunit of caspase  our results further show that the active site pocket of caspase  is first occupied by the linker region followed by the interaction of the n terminus of the enzyme with the smac binding site of the bir domain
