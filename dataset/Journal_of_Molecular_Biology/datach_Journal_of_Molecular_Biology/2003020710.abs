structural analysis of the rate limiting transition states in the folding of im and im  similarities and differences in the folding of homologous proteins
the bacterial immunity proteins im and im fold with mechanisms of different kinetic complexity whilst im folds in a two state transition at ph   and   c im populates an on pathway intermediate under these conditions in order to assess the role of sequence versus topology in the folding of these proteins and to analyse the effect of populating an intermediate on the landscape for folding we have determined the conformational properties of the rate limiting transition state for im folding unfolding using  f value analysis and have compared the results with similar data obtained previously for im  the data show that the rate limiting transition states for im and im folding unfolding are similar both are compact  t   and    respectively and contain three of the four native helices docked around a specific hydrophobic core significant differences are observed however in the magnitude of the  f values obtained for the two proteins of the  residues studied in both proteins ten have  f values in im that exceed those in im by more than   and of these five differ by more than   the data suggest that the population of an intermediate in im results in folding via a transition state ensemble that is conformationally restricted relative to that of im  the data are consistent with the view that topology is an important determinant of folding importantly however they also demonstrate that while the folding transition state may be conserved in homologous proteins that fold with two and three state kinetics the population of an intermediate can have a significant effect on the breadth of the transition state ensemble
