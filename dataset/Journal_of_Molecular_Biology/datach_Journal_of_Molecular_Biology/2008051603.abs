lupinus luteus pathogenesis related protein as a reservoir for cytokinin
plant pathogenesis related pr proteins of class   pr   are small and cytosolic the main feature of their three dimensional structure is a large cavity between a seven stranded antiparallel  sheet and a long c terminal  helix although pr  proteins are abundant in plants their physiological role remains unknown recent data have indicated ligand binding as their possible biological function the article describes the structure of a complex between a classic pr  protein yellow lupine llpr   b and the plant hormone trans zeatin previously trans zeatin binding has been reported in a structurally related cytokinin specific binding protein which has a distant sequence relation with classic pr  proteins in the present     resolution crystallographic model three perfectly ordered zeatin molecules are found in the binding cavity of the protein the fact that three zeatin molecules are bound by the protein when only a fourfold molar excess of the ligand was used indicates an unusual type of affinity for this ligand and suggests that llpr   b and perhaps other pr  proteins as well acts as a reservoir of cytokinin molecules in the aqueous environment of the cell
