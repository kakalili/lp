Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are responsible for recognition of particular pathogens during the innate immune response and cytoplasmic Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain responsible for downstream signaling. TLR6 working with TLR2 can detect bacterial lipoprotein leading signal for nuclear factor-kappaB activation for immune response. To better understand TLR-mediated signaling event in the innate immune system, in this study, we report the first crystal structure of the TIR domain of TLR6 at 2.2Å resolution. Our structure reveals novel homo-dimerization interfaces, which might be a critical for the interaction with TIR-containing adaptor proteins and itself. We also report structural similarities and differences of TLR6 with those of other TIR domains, which may be functionally relevant.
