crystal structure and biochemical properties of the d arabinose dehydrogenase from sulfolobus solfataricus
sulfolobus solfataricus metabolizes the five carbon sugar d arabinose to  oxoglutarate by an inducible pathway consisting of dehydrogenases and dehydratases here we report the crystal structure and biochemical properties of the first enzyme of this pathway the d arabinose dehydrogenase the aradh structure was solved to a resolution of     by single wavelength anomalous diffraction and phased using the two endogenous zinc ions per subunit the structure revealed a catalytic and cofactor binding domain typically present in mesophilic and thermophilic alcohol dehydrogenases cofactor modeling showed the presence of a phosphate binding pocket sequence motif srs x h  which is likely to be responsible for the enzyme s preference for nadp  the homo tetrameric enzyme is specific for d arabinose l fucose l galactose and d ribose which could be explained by the hydrogen bonding patterns of the c and c hydroxyl groups observed in substrate docking simulations the enzyme optimally converts sugars at ph   and    c and displays a half life of  and   min at  and    c respectively indicating that the enzyme is thermostable at physiological operating temperatures of    c the structure represents the first crystal structure of an nadp dependent member of the medium chain dehydrogenase reductase mdr superfamily from archaea
