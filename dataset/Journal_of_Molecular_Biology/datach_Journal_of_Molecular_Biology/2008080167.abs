a new protein architecture for processing alkylation damaged dna the crystal structure of dna glycosylase alkd
dna glycosylases safeguard the genome by locating and excising chemically modified bases from dna alkd is a recently discovered bacterial dna glycosylase that removes positively charged methylpurines from dna and was predicted to adopt a protein fold distinct from from those of other dna repair proteins the crystal structure of bacillus cereus alkd presented here shows that the protein is composed exclusively of helical heat like repeats which form a solenoid perfectly shaped to accommodate a dna duplex on the concave surface structural analysis of the variant heat repeats in alkd provides a rationale for how this protein scaffolding motif has been modified to bind dna we report mg excision and dna binding activities of alkd mutants along with a comparison of alkylpurine dna glycosylase structures together these data provide important insight into the requirements for alkylation repair within dna and suggest that alkd utilizes a novel strategy to manipulate dna in its search for alkylpurine bases
