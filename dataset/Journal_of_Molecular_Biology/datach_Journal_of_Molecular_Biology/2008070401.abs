crystal structures of escherichia coli  glutamyltranspeptidase in complex with azaserine and acivicin novel mechanistic implication for inhibition by glutamine antagonists
glutamyltranspeptidase ggt catalyzes the cleavage of such  glutamyl compounds as glutathione and the transfer of their  glutamyl group to water or to other amino acids and peptides ggt is involved in a number of biological phenomena such as drug resistance and metastasis of cancer cells by detoxification of xenobiotics azaserine and acivicin are classical and irreversible inhibitors of ggt but their binding sites and the inhibition mechanisms remain to be defined we have determined the crystal structures of ggt from escherichia coli in complex with azaserine and acivicin at     resolution both inhibitors are bound to ggt at its substrate binding pocket in a manner similar to that observed previously with the  glutamyl enzyme intermediate they form a covalent bond with the o  atom of thr   the catalytic residue of ggt their  carboxy and  amino groups are recognized by extensive hydrogen bonding and charge interactions with the residues that are conserved among ggt orthologs the two amido nitrogen atoms of gly  and gly   which form the oxyanion hole interact with the inhibitors directly or via a water molecule notably in the azaserine complex the carbon atom that forms a covalent bond with thr  is sp hybridized suggesting that the carbonyl of azaserine is attacked by thr  to form a tetrahedral intermediate which is stabilized by the oxyanion hole furthermore when acivicin is bound to ggt a migration of the single and double bonds occurs in its dihydroisoxazole ring the structural characteristics presented here imply that the unprecedented binding modes of azaserine and acivicin are conserved in all ggts from bacteria to mammals and give a new insight into the inhibition mechanism of glutamine amidotransferases by these glutamine antagonists
