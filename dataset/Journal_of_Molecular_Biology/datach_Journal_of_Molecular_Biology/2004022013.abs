commitment and nucleation in the protein g transition state
an accurate characterization of the transition state ensemble tse is central to furthering our understanding of the protein folding reaction we have extensively tested a recently reported method for studying a protein s tse utilizing  value data from protein engineering experiments and computational studies as restraints in all atom monte carlo mc simulations the validity of interpreting experimental  values as the fraction of native contacts made by a residue in the tse was explored revealing that this definition is unable to uniquely specify a tse the identification of protein g s second hairpin in both pre and post transition conformations demonstrates that high experimental  values do not guarantee a residue s importance in the tse an analysis of simulations based on structures restrained by experimental  values is necessary to yield this result which is not obvious from a simplistic interpretation of individual  values the tse that we obtain corresponds to a single specific nucleation event characterized by six residues common to all three observed convergent folding pathways the same specific nucleus was independently identified from computational and experimental data and  conservation of conservation  analysis in the protein g fold when associated strictly with complete nucleus formation and concomitant chain collapse folding is a well defined two state event once the nucleus has formed the folding reaction enters a slow relaxation process associated with side chain packing and small local backbone rearrangements a detailed analysis of  values and their relationship to the transition state ensemble allows us to construct a unified theoretical model of protein g folding
