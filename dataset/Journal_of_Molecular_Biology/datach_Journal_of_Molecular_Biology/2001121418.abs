family  cellobiohydrolases from phanerochaete chrysosporium crystal structure of the catalytic module of cel d cbh  at     resolution and homology models of the isozymes edited by r huber
cellobiohydrolase   cel d is the major cellulase produced by the white rot fungus phanerochaete chrysosporium constituting approximately   of the total secreted protein in liquid culture on cellulose the enzyme is classified into family  of the glycosyl hydrolases together with cellobiohydrolase i cel a and endoglucanase i cel b from trichoderma reesei like those enzymes it catalyses cellulose hydrolysis with net retention of the anomeric carbon configuration the structure of the catalytic module   residues of cel d was determined at    resolution using the structure of cel a from t reesei as a search model in molecular replacement and ultimately refined at     resolution the core structure is a  sandwich composed of two large and mainly antiparallel  sheets packed onto each other a long cellulose binding groove is formed by loops on one face of the sandwich the catalytic residues are conserved and the mechanism is expected to be the same as for other family members the phanerochaete cel d binding site is more open than that of the t reesei cellobiohydrolase as a result of deletions and other changes in the loop regions which may explain observed differences in catalytic properties the binding site is not however as open as the groove of the corresponding endoglucanase a tyrosine residue at the entrance of the tunnel may be part of an additional subsite not present in the t reesei cellobiohydrolase the cel d structure was used to model the products of the five other family  genes found in p chrysosporium the results suggest that at least two of these will have differences in specificity and possibly catalytic mechanism thus offering some explanation for the presence of cel isozymes in this species which are differentially expressed in response to various growth conditions
