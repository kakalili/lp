dna double strand break formation upon uv induced replication stress activates atm and dna pkcs kinases
the phosphatidylinositol  kinase like protein kinases including atm ataxia telangiectasia mutated  atr ataxia telangiectasia and rad related  and dna pkcs dna dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit  are the main kinases activated following various assaults on dna although atm and dna pkcs kinases are activated upon dna double strand breaks evidence suggests that these kinases are rapidly phosphorylated by atr kinase upon uv irradiation thus these kinases may also participate in the response to replication stress using uv induced replication stress we further characterize whether atm and dna pkcs kinase activities are also involved in the cellular response contrary to the rapid activation of the atr dependent pathway atm dependent chk and kap  phosphorylations as well as dna pkcs ser   autophosphorylation reach their peak level at  to  h after uv irradiation the delayed kinetics of atm and dna pkcs dependent phosphorylations also correlated with a surge in h ax phosphorylation suggesting that double strand break formation resulting from collapse of replication forks is responsible for the activation of atm and dna pkcs kinases in addition we observed that some phosphorylation events initiated by atr kinase in the response to uv were mediated by atm at a later phase of the response furthermore the s phase checkpoint after uv irradiation was defective in atm deficient cells these results suggest that the late increase of atm activity is needed to complement the decreasing atr activity for maintaining a vigilant checkpoint regulation upon replication stress
