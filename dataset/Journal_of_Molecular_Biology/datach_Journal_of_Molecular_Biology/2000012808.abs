x ray structure of yeast hal p a major target of lithium and sodium toxicity and identification of framework interactions determining cation sensitivity edited by r huber
the product of the yeast hal gene hal p is an in vivo target of sodium and lithium toxicity and its overexpression improves salt tolerance in yeast and plants hal p is a metabolic phosphatase which catalyses the hydrolysis of   phosphoadenosine   phosphate pap to amp it is the prototype of an evolutionarily conserved family of pap phosphatases and the engineering of sodium insensitive enzymes of this group may contribute to the generation of salt tolerant crops we have solved the crystal structure of hal p in complex with magnesium lithium and the two products of pap hydrolysis amp and pi at    resolution a functional screening of random mutations of the hal gene in growing yeast generated forms of the enzyme with reduced cation sensitivity analysis of these mutants defined a salt bridge glu    arg   and a hydrophobic bond va    trp   as important framework interactions determining cation sensitivity hal p belongs to a larger superfamily of lithium sensitive phosphatases which includes inositol monophosphatase the hydrophobic interaction mutated in hal p is conserved in this superfamily and its disruption in human inositol monophosphatase also resulted in reduced cation sensitivity
