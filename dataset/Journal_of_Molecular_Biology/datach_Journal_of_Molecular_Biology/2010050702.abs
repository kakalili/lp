crystal structures of the cbs and drtgg domains of the regulatory region of clostridiumperfringens pyrophosphatase complexed with the inhibitor amp and activator diadenosine tetraphosphate
nucleotide binding cystathionine  synthase cbs domains serve as regulatory units in numerous proteins distributed in all kingdoms of life however the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain to be established recently we described a subfamily of cbs domain containing pyrophosphatases ppases within family ii ppases here we express a novel cbs ppase from clostridium perfringens cpe   and show that the enzyme is inhibited by amp and activated by a novel effector diadenosine    p p tetraphosphate ap a  the structures of the amp and ap a complexes of the regulatory region of c perfringens ppase cpcbs  comprising a pair of cbs domains interlinked by a drtgg domain were determined at     resolution using x ray crystallography the structures obtained are the first structures of a drtgg domain as part of a larger protein structure the amp complex contains two amp molecules per cpcbs dimer each bound to a single monomer whereas in the activator bound complex one ap a molecule bridges two monomers in the nucleotide bound structures activator binding induces significant opening of the cbs domain interface compared with the inhibitor complex these results provide structural insight into the mechanism of cbs ppase regulation by nucleotides
