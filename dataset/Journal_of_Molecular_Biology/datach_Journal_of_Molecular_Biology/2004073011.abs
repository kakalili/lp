moment based prediction of dna binding proteins
net charge electric dipole moment and quadrupole moment tensors were calculated for  amino acid sequences from  representative dna binding proteins with known structures it was found that the magnitudes of the moments of electric charge distribution in these chains differ significantly from those of a non binding control data set net charge net dipole moment and quadrupole moment could each distinguish binding and non binding proteins with       and    accuracy by single variable predictors without cross validation using hybrid predictors with information of charge and both moments the best predictions were    without cross validation and    for the cross validated data sets this level of prediction accuracy obtained with these simple descriptors competes with the results obtained using more complex models including many descriptors the coarse graining of atomic charges onto c  atoms did not reduce the prediction accuracy significantly this result suggests that we can use c  coordinates derived from homology modeling to predict dna binding proteins the speed and accuracy of this method in combination with homology based methods of structure prediction should enhance genome wide recognition of dna binding proteins
