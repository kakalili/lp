directional phosphorylation and nuclear transport of the splicing factor srsf is regulated by an rna recognition motif
multisite phosphorylation is required for the biological function of serine  arginine sr proteins a family of essential regulators of mrna splicing these modifications are catalyzed by serine  arginine protein kinases srpks that phosphorylate numerous serines in arginine  serine rich rs domains of sr proteins using a directional c to n terminal mechanism the present studies explore how srpks govern this highly biased phosphorylation reaction and investigate biological roles of the observed directional phosphorylation mechanism using nmr spectroscopy with two separately expressed domains of srsf  we showed that several residues in the rna binding motif  interact with the n terminal region of the rs domain rs  these contacts provide a structural framework that balances the activities of srpk and the protein phosphatase pp  thereby regulating the phosphoryl content of the rs domain disruption of the implicated intramolecular rna binding motif   rs domain interaction impairs both the directional phosphorylation mechanism and the nuclear translocation of srsf demonstrating that the intrinsic phosphorylation bias is obligatory for sr protein biological function
