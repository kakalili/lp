Ribosomal protein S15 binds specifically to the central domain of 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) and directs the assembly of four additional proteins to this domain. The central domain of 16S rRNA along with these five proteins form the platform of the 30S subunit. Previously, directed hydroxyl radical probing from Fe(II)-S15 in small ribonucleoprotein complexes was used to study assembly of the central domain of 16S rRNA. Here, this same approach was used to understand the 16S rRNA environment of Fe(II)-S15 in 30S subunits and to determine the ribosomal proteins that are involved in forming the mature S15-16S rRNA environment. We have identified additional sites of Fe(II)-S15-directed cleavage in 30S subunits compared to the binary complex of Fe(II)-S15/16S rRNA. Along with novel targets in the central domain, sites within the 5′ and 3′ minor domains are also cleaved. This suggests that during the course of 30S subunit assembly these elements are positioned in the vicinity of S15. Besides the previously determined role for S8, roles for S5, S6+S18, and S16 in altering the 16S rRNA environment of S15 were established. These studies reveal that ribosomal proteins can alter the assembly of regions of the 30S subunit from a considerable distance and influence the overall conformation of this ribonucleoprotein particle.
