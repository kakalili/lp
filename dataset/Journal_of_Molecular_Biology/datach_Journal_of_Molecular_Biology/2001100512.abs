self assembly of the amphipathic helix vhlppp  a mechanism for zein protein body formation edited by w baumeister
zein a maize storage protein with an n terminal proline rich repetitive domain   znprd  is located at the periphery of protein bodies this domain appears to be indispensable for the aggregation of the protein on the surface of the organelle the peptide vhlppp  spanning the  znprd adopts a polyproline ii ppii conformation that gives an amphipathic helix different from the  helix we used atomic force microscopy to study the surface organisation of the octamer and transmission electron microscopy to visualise aggregates of the peptide in aqueous solution we consider two self assembly patterns that take account of the observed features the micellar one fits best with the experimental results presented moreover we found that this peptide has properties associated with surfactants and form micelles in solution this spontaneous amphipathic arrangement of the  znprd suggests a mechanism of  zein deposition inside maize protein bodies
