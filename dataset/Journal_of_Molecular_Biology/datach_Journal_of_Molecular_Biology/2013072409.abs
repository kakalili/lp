structural and functional analysis of the human nuclear xenobiotic receptor pxr in complex with rxr
the human nuclear xenobiotic receptor pxr recognizes a range of potentially harmful drugs and endobiotic chemicals but must complex with the nuclear receptor rxr  to control the expression of numerous drug metabolism genes to date the structural basis and functional consequences of this interaction have remained unclear here we present    resolution crystal structures of the heterodimeric complex formed between the ligand binding domains of human pxr and rxr  these structures establish that pxr and rxr  form a heterotetramer unprecedented in the nuclear receptor family of ligand regulated transcription factors we further show that both pxr and rxr  bind to the transcriptional coregulator src  with higher affinity when they are part of the pxr rxr  heterotetramer complex than they do when each ligand binding domain is examined alone furthermore we purify the full length forms of each receptor from recombinant bacterial expression systems and characterize their interactions with a range of direct and everted repeat dna elements taken together these data advance our understanding of pxr the master regulator of drug metabolism gene expression in humans in its functional partnership with rxr
