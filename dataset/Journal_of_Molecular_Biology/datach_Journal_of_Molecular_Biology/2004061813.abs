the roles of glu  and glu  in the catalytic reaction of soybean  amylase
it has previously been suggested that the glutamic acid residues glu  and glu  of soybean  amylase play critical roles as a general acid and a general base catalyst respectively in order to confirm the roles of glu  and glu   each residue was mutated to a glutamine residue and the crystal structures of the substrate e  q maltopentaose and product e  q maltose complexes were determined at resolutions of    and    respectively both mutant enzymes exhibited     and    fold decreased activity relative to that of the wild type enzyme the crystal structure of the e  q maltopentaose complex revealed an unambiguous five glucose unit at subsites   to   two maltose molecules bind on subsites   to   and  to  in the e  q maltose complex whereas they bind in tandem to   to   and  to  in the wild type maltose complex the conformation of the glucose residue at subsite   was identified as a stable c   anomer in the e  q maltose complex whereas a distorted ring conformation was observed in the wild type maltose complex the side chain movement of gln  to the position of a putative attacking water molecule seen in the wild type enzyme caused the inactivation of the e  q mutant and an altered binding pattern of maltose molecules these results confirm the critical roles played by glu  in the donation of a proton to the glycosidic oxygen of the substrate and by glu  in the activation of an attacking water molecule the observed difference between the backbones of e  q maltopentaose and e  q maltose in terms of thr  suggests that the side chain of thr  may stabilize the deprotonated form of glu  after the cleavage of the glycosidic bond
