Human serum albumin is the most abundant protein in the circulatory system, and one of its principal functions is to transport fatty acids. Binding of octanoate, decanoate, laurate and myristate was studied by a rate-of-dialysis technique. The primary association constants increased, but not linearly, with chain length. The number of high-affinity sites also increased with chain length; octanoate and decanoate bind to one such site, whereas laurate and myristate most probably bind to two sites. Albumin is composed of three homologous helical domains (Iâ€“III), which can be subdivided into two subdomains (A and B). For getting information about the positions of the high-affinity sites we produced 13 recombinant isoforms mutated in four different subdomains. Results obtained with these albumins are in accordance with the following model: octanoate and decanoate bind to a single site in subdomain IIIA, laurate binds to sites in subdomains IIIA and IIIB, whereas myristate binds in subdomains IB and IIIB. The results also showed that primary fatty acid binding is sensitive to amino acid substitutions in other parts of the protein. This is in contrast to the effect of amino acid substitutions of genetic albumin variants (alloalbumins). Usually these substitutions, which are situated at the surface of the protein, have no effect on fatty acid binding. Binding of fatty acid anions to different high-affinity sites and the sensitivity of these sites to amino acid substitutions elsewhere in the protein (and perhaps also to other types of modifications) are important factors that could effect simultaneous binding of other ligands, e.g. in patients treated with albumin-binding drugs.
