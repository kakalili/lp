heat shock protein  regulates development in dictyostelium discoideum
cytosolic heat shock protein   hsp  has been implicated in diverse biological processes such as protein folding cell cycle control signal transduction development and morphological evolution model systems available for studying hsp  function either allow ease of manipulation for biochemical studies or facilitate a phenomenological study of its role in influencing phenotype in this work we have explored the use of the cellular slime mold dictyostelium discoideum to examine cellular functions of hsp  in relation to its multicellular development in addition to cloning purification biochemical characterization and examination of its crystal structure our studies using a pharmacological inhibitor of hsp  demonstrate a role for the cytoplasmic isoform hspd in d discoideum development inhibition of hspd function using geldanamycin ga resulted in delayed aggregation and arrest of d discoideum development at the  mound  stage crystal structure of the amino terminal domain of hspd showed a binding pocket similar to that described for yeast hsp  fluorescence spectroscopy as well as ga coupled beads affinity pulldown confirmed a specific interaction between hspd and ga the results presented here provide an important insight into the function of hspd in d discoideum development and emphasize the potential of the cellular slime mold to serve as an effective model for studying the many roles of hsp  at cellular and organismal levels
