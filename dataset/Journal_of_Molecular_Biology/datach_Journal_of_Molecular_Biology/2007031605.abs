mutation in the vp ldv motif of the murine polyomavirus affects viral infectivity and conditions virus tissue tropism in vivo
the first contact of a virus with the host cell surface and further entry are important steps for a successful outcome of the infection process and for the virus associated pathogenicity we have previously shown that the entry of the murine polyomavirus py into fibroblasts is a multi step process involving at least the attachment to primary sialic acids sa containing cell receptors followed by post binding interaction with secondary receptors such as the    integrin likely through the vp ldv motif here we report on the functional role of the vp ldv motif in py infectivity and in vivo virus tissue tropism for this purpose we have characterized a recombinant virus mutant pylnv harboring a single aa substitution in this motif d  n  although not critical for virus viability the d  n substitution abrogates the post attachment py     interaction rendering the pylnv mutant virus twofold less infectious than the py wild type wt in    positive fibroblasts to study the putative role of the vp ldv motif in vivo newborn c bl  mice were inoculated with pywt or pylnv and after six days organs were analyzed for the presence of viral dna intriguingly pylnv showed an altered spectrum of in vivo replication compared with pywt particularly in the skin and in the kidney the implication of py     integrin interaction in conditioning tissue specificity of virus replication is discussed
