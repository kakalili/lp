negatively charged phospholipid membranes induce amyloid formation of medin via an  helical intermediate
medin a recently discovered   kda peptide is associated with amyloid deposits in the medial layer of human arteries and the prevalence is nearly   within individuals above  years presently not much is known about its biochemical and biophysical properties or its pathway from soluble peptide to insoluble amyloid here we have characterized the behavior of medin in the presence of lipid membranes using circular dichroism isothermal titration calorimetry differential scanning calorimetry size exclusion chromatography and atomic force microscopy afm  medin was shown to exist as a monomer in solution with a predominantly random coil structure it binds lipid vesicles that have either a neutral or a negative surface potential upon association to membranes containing acidic lipids it undergoes an electrostatically driven conformational change towards a mainly  helical state prolonged incubation converts medin from an  helical structure into an amyloid  sheet fibrillar state as confirmed by afm based on these findings we propose a mechanism of medin amyloid formation where medin electrostatically associates in its monomeric form to biological interfaces displaying a negative potential this process both increases the local peptide concentration and induces an aggregation prone  helical fold
