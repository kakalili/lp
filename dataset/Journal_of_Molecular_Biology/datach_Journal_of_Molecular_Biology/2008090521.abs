inferred motions of the s a helix during voltage dependent k channel gating
the gating of voltage dependent potassium channels is controlled by conformational changes in voltage sensor domains previous studies have shown that the s and the s helices of the voltage sensor are static with respect to motion across the membrane while the voltage sensor paddle consisting of the c terminal half of s  s b and the charge bearing s is mobile the mobile component is attached to s and s via the s  s turn and the n terminal half of s  s a  in this study we analyze kvap an archaebacterial voltage dependent potassium channel to study the mobility with respect to translation across the membrane of s a we utilize an assay based on attachment of tethered biotin and its site specific accessibility to avidin our results reveal that the s a helix does not move appreciably across the membrane in association with gating the static behavior of s a constrains the conformations available to the voltage sensor when it closes and suggests that a set of negative countercharges within the membrane s inner leaflet remains intact in the closed conformation
