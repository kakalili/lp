sec is a highly efficient exchange factor for the rab protein sec
sec is a reversibly membrane associated multi domain protein with guanine nucleotide exchange activity towards the yeast rab protein sec  both proteins are localized to secretory vesicles destined for exocytosis we have used transient kinetic methods to show that sec is a highly active exchange factor in contrast to other proteins previously characterized as rab exchange factors with a kd value for the sec sec gdp interaction of ca    m and a maximal rate of gdp displacement of ca  s   it is      fold more effective than other proteins showing exchange activity towards rabs mss  dss  vps  and ca tenfold faster than cdc  as a ras specific exchanger although still   fold slower than the fastest systems studied so far ef tu ef ts and ran rcc  a comparison with other proteins showing rab exchange activity shows that maximal rates of gdp dissociation catalyzed by sec are orders of magnitude faster when comparing sec with dss  which also acts on sec  the difference was particularly dramatic another difference is seen in the kinetics of association of gtp with the sec sec complex a process which is extremely slow for dss mss complexes with cognate rabs but in the range observed for other gtpase exchanger complexes for sec sec  it is suggested that systems such as ef tu ef ts and ran rcc have evolved for maximal possible activity for the interaction between two soluble proteins whereas other evolutionary constraints which are connected to the spatial and temporal coordination of events in vesicular transport and other regulatory networks have determined the detailed kinetic properties of the other systems
