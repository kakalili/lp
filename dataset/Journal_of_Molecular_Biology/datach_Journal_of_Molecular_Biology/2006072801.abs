crystal structure of the catalytic domain of human map kinase phosphatase  structural insight into constitutively active phosphatase
map kinase phosphatase  mkp  is a member of the mitogen activated protein kinase phosphatase mkp family and selectively dephosphorylates jnk and p  we have determined the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of human mkp  mkp c to     in previously reported mkp c structures the residues that constitute the active site are seriously deviated from the active conformation of protein tyrosine phosphatases ptps  which are accompanied by low catalytic activity high activities of mkps are achieved by binding their cognate substrates representing substrate induced activation however the mkp c structure adopts an active conformation of ptp even in the absence of its substrate binding which is consistent with the previous results that mkp solely possesses the intrinsic activity further we identify a sequence motif common to the members of mkps having low catalytic activity by comparing structures and sequences of other mkps our structural information provides an explanation of constitutive activity of mkp as well as the structural insight into substrate induced activation occurred in other mkps
