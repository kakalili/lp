Coiled coils serve as dimerization domains for a wide variety of proteins, including the medically important oligomeric tumor suppressor protein, APC. Mutations in the APC gene are associated with an inherited susceptibility to colon cancer and with ∼75 % of sporadic colorectal tumors. To define the basis for APC pairing and to explore the anatomy of dimeric coiled coils, we determined the 2.4 Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of the N-terminal dimerization domain of APC. The peptide APC-55, encompassing the heptad repeats in APC residues 2–55, primarily forms an α-helical, coiled-coil dimer with newly observed core packing features. Correlated asymmetric packing of four core residues in distinct, standard rotamers is associated with a small shift in the helix register. At the C terminus, the helices splay apart and interact with a symmetry-related dimer in the crystal to form a short, anti-parallel, four-helix bundle. N-terminal fraying and C-terminal splaying of the helices, as well as the asymmetry and helix register shift describe unprecedented dynamic excursions of coiled coils. The low stability of APC-55 and divergence from the expected coiled-coil fold support the suggestion that the APC dimerization domain may extend beyond the first 55 residues.
