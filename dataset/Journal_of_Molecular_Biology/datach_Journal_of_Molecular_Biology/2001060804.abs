protein chemistry at membrane interfaces non additivity of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions
non specific binding of proteins and peptides to charged membrane interfaces depends upon the combined contributions of hydrophobic  gh  and electrostatic  ges free energies if these are simply additive then the observed free energy of binding  gobs will be given by  gobs  gh   ges where  gh    npanp and  ges zf  in these expressions anp is the non polar accessible area  np the non polar solvation parameter z the formal peptide valence f the faraday constant and  the membrane surface potential but several lines of evidence suggest that hydrophobic and electrostatic binding free energies of proteins at membrane interfaces such as those associated with cell signaling are not simply additive in order to explore this issue systematically we have determined the interfacial partitioning free energies of variants of indolicidin a cationic proline rich antimicrobial peptide the synthesized variants of the  residue peptide covered a wide range of hydrophobic free energies which allowed us to examine the effect of hydrophobicity on electrostatic binding to membranes formed from mixtures of neutral and anionic lipids although  gobs was always a linear function of  gh  the slope depended upon anionic lipid content the slope was   for pure zwitterionic phosphocholine bilayers and   for pure phosphoglycerol membranes  gobs also varied linearly with surface potential but the slope was smaller than the expected value zf as observed by others this suggests an effective peptide valence zeff that is smaller than the formal valence z because of our systematic approach we were able to establish a useful rule of thumb zeff is reduced relative to z by about   for each kcal mol    kcal   kj favorable increase in  gh  for neutral phosphocholine interfaces we found that  gobs could be predicted with remarkable accuracy using the wimley white experiment based interfacial hydrophobicity scale
