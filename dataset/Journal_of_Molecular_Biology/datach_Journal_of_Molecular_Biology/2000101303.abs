crystal structures of recombinant histones hmfa and hmfb from the hyperthermophilic archaeon methanothermus fervidus edited by k nagai
the hyperthermophilic archaeon methanothermus fervidus contains two small basic proteins hmfa   amino acid residues and hmfb   residues that share a common ancestry with the eukaryal nucleosome core histones h a h b h  and h  hmfa and hmfb have sequences that differ at  locations they have different structural stabilities and the complexes that they form with dna have different electrophoretic mobilities here crystal structures are documented for recombinant r hmfa at a resolution of     refined to a crystallographic r value of     tetragonal form and at     refined to a r value of     orthorhombic form  and for rhmfb at    refined to a r value of     the rhmfa and rhmfb monomers have structures that are just histone folds in which a long central  helix     residues is separated from shorter n terminal     residues and c terminal     residues   helices by two loops l and l  both  residues  within l and l  three adjacent residues are in extended   conformation rhmfa and rhmfb assemble into homodimers with the   helices anti parallel aligned and crossing at an angle of close to    and with hydrogen bonds formed between the extended parallel regions of l and l resulting in short  ladders dimerization creates a novel n terminal structure that contains four proline residues two from each monomer as prolines are present at these positions in all archaeal histone sequences this proline tetrad structure is likely to be a common feature of all archaeal histone dimers almost all residues that participate in monomer monomer interactions are conserved in hmfa and hmfb consistent with the ability of these monomers to form both homodimers and hmfa hmfb heterodimers differences in side chain interactions that result from non conservative residue differences in hmfa and hmfb are identified and the structure of a rhmfa  dna complex is presented based on the structures documented here and modeled by homology to histone dna interactions in the eukaryal nucleosome
