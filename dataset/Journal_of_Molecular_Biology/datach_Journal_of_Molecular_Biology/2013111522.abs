hsp  inhibits  synuclein aggregation by interacting with soluble oligomers
aggregated  synuclein is one of the main components of the pathological lewy bodies associated with parkinson s disease pd  many other proteins including chaperones such as hsp  and hsp  have been found co localized with lewy bodies and the expression levels of hsp  have been found to be increased in brains of pd patients although the role of hsp  in the aggregation of  synuclein has been extensively studied relatively little is known about the effect of hsp  on this process here we have investigated if hsp  can prevent the aggregation of the a t pathological mutant of  synuclein in vitro a detailed study using many biophysical methods has revealed that hsp  prevents  synuclein from aggregating in an atp independent manner and that it forms a strong complex with the transiently populated toxic oligomeric  synuclein species formed along the aggregation pathway we have also shown that upon forming a complex with hsp  the oligomers are rendered harmless and nontoxic to cells thus we have clear evidence that hsp  is likely to play an important role on these processes in vivo
