the high risk hpv  e oncoprotein mediates interaction between the transcriptional coactivator cbp and the retinoblastoma protein prb
the oncoprotein e from human papillomavirus hpv strains that confer high cancer risk mediates cell transformation by deregulating host cellular processes and activating viral gene expression through recruitment of cellular proteins such as the retinoblastoma protein prb and the cyclic amp response element binding binding protein cbp and its paralog p   here we show that the intrinsically disordered n terminal region of e from high risk hpv  binds the taz domain of cbp with greater affinity than e from low risk hpv b hpv e and the tumor suppressor p  compete for binding to taz  the taz binding site in e overlaps the lxcxe motif that is crucial for interaction with prb while taz and prb compete for binding to a monomeric e polypeptide the full length e dimer mediates an interaction between taz and prb by promoting formation of a ternary complex cell based assays show that expression of full length hpv  e promotes increased prb acetylation and that this response depends both on the presence of cbp p  and on the ability of e to form a dimer these observations suggest a model for the oncogenic effect of high risk hpv  e  the disordered region of one e molecule in the homodimer interacts with the pocket domain of prb while the same region of the other e molecule binds the taz domain of cbp p   through its ability to dimerize e recruits cbp p  and prb into a ternary complex bringing the histone acetyltransferase domain of cbp p  into proximity to prb and promoting acetylation leading to disruption of cell cycle control
