direct visualisation of the  sheet structure of synthetic alzheimer  s amyloid edited by f e cohen
amyloid fibrils are a major pathological feature of alzheimer  s disease as well as other amyloidoses including the prion diseases they are an unusual phenomenon being made up of different normally soluble proteins which undergo a profound conformational change and assemble to form very stable insoluble fibrils which accumulate in the extracellular spaces in alzheimer  s disease the amyloid fibrils are composed of the a  protein knowledge of the structure of amyloid is essential for understanding the abnormal assembly and deposition of these fibrils and could lead to the rational design of therapeutic agents for their prevention or disaggregation here we reveal the core structure of an alzheimer  s amyloid fibril by direct visualisation using cryo electron microscopy synthetic amyloid fibrils composed of a  residues  to  and  to  were examined the a     fibrils are clearly composed of  sheet structure that is observable as striations across the fibres the  strands run perpendicular to the fibre axis and the projections show that the fibres are composed of  sheets with the strands in direct register this observation has implications not only for the further understanding of amyloid but also for the development of cryo electron microscopy for direct visualisation of secondary structure
