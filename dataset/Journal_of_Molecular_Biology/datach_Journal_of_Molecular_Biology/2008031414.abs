the crystal structure of plant specific calcium binding protein atcbl in complex with the regulatory domain of atcipk
calcium signals mediate a multitude of plant responses to external stimuli calcineurin b like cbl proteins and their target kinases cbl interacting protein kinases cipks  represent important relays in plant calcium signaling cbl interacts with cipk through a conserved motif naf fisl motif within the c terminal regulatory domain to better understand the functional role of the cbl  cipk system we determined the crystal structure of atcbl in complex with the regulatory domain of atcipk  at     resolution the naf fisl motif is inserted into a hydrophobic crevice within atcbl  accompanied by a large displacement of the helices and loop on the opposite side of the naf fisl motif from the c terminal region which shields the hydrophobic crevice in free form ca  are coordinated within four ef hands in atcbl in bound form this calcium coordination pattern differs from that in the structure of the sos  sos complex previously reported structural comparison of the two structures shows that the recognition of cbl by cipk is performed in a similar manner but inherent interactions confer binding affinity and specificity
