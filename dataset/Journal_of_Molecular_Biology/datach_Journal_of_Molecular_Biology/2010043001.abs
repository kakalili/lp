systematic mutational analysis of peptide inhibition of the p   mdm mdmx interactions
inhibition of the interaction between the tumor suppressor protein p  and its negative regulators mdm and mdmx is of great interest in cancer biology and drug design we previously reported a potent duodecimal peptide inhibitor termed pmi tsfaeywnllsp  of the p   mdm and  mdmx interactions pmi competes with p  for mdm and mdmx binding at an affinity roughly  orders of magnitude higher than that of    p  etfsdlwkllpe of the same length both peptides adopt nearly identical  helical conformations in the complexes where the three highlighted hydrophobic residues phe trp and leu dominate pmi or    p  binding to mdm and mdmx to elucidate the molecular determinants for pmi activity and specificity we performed a systematic ala scanning mutational analysis of pmi and    p  the binding affinities for mdm and mdmx of a total of  peptides including  truncation analogs were quantified affording a complete dissection of energetic contributions of individual residues of pmi and    p  to mdm and mdmx association importantly the n a mutation turned pmi into the most potent dual specific antagonist of mdm and mdmx reported to date registering respective kd values of   pm and   nm the co crystal structure of n a  pmi      mdm was determined at      affirming that high affinity peptide binding to mdm mdmx necessitates in addition to optimized intermolecular interactions enhanced helix stability or propensity contributed by non contact residues the powerful empirical binding data and crystal structures present a unique opportunity for computational studies of peptide inhibition of the p   mdm mdmx interactions
