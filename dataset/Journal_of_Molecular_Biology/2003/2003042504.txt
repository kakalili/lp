Many mitochondrial matrix and inner-membrane proteins are synthesized in the cytosol as precursor proteins with an N-terminal presequence, and are imported into the mitochondria. Although no distinct sequence homology has been found among mitochondrial presequences, Tom20, a general import receptor in the outer mitohcondrial membrane, binds to presequences, and distinguishes mitochondrial proteins from non-mitochonrial proteins. The recently determined structure of the cytosolic domain of Tom20 (ΔTom20) in a complex with the presequence of rat aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) showed that a short stretch of the presequence forms an amphiphilic helix, and its hydrophobic surface interacts with the hydrophobic-binding groove of Tom20. The following NMR analyses revealed a common five-residue pattern for Tom20 binding in five different presequences. To refine the common amino acid motif for the recognition by Tom20, we introduced a new peptide library approach in this study: we prepared a mixture of ALDH presequence variants, tethered these peptides to ΔTom20 in a competitive manner by an intermolecular disulfide bond, and determined the relative affinities by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. We successfully deduced a refined, common motif for the recognition by Tom20, and found that the segment consisting of residues 14–20 of the ALDH presequence was locally optimized in the sequence space, with respect to Tom20 binding.
