unexpected distinct roles of the related histone h lysine  methyltransferases g a and g a like protein in myoblasts
lysine methyltransferases g a and glp g a like protein are highly homologous and form functional heterodimeric complexes that establish mono and dimethylation on histone h lysine  h k me  h k me  in euchromatin here we describe unexpected distinct roles for g a and glp in skeletal muscle terminal differentiation indeed gain or loss of function assays in myoblasts showed in agreement with previous reports that g a inhibits terminal differentiation while glp plays a more intricate role in muscle differentiation in one hand both glp gain and loss of function inhibit late steps of differentiation on the other hand in contrast to g a glp overexpression promotes abnormal precocious expression of muscle differentiation specific genes already in proliferating myoblasts in agreement transcriptomic analysis indicates that g a and glp regulate different sets of genes thus glp but not g a inhibits proteasome subunit encoding genes expression resulting in an inhibition of the proteasome activities subsequently glp but not g a overexpression stabilizes myod that is likely to be responsible for muscle markers expression in proliferating myoblasts
