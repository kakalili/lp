amino acids in the second transmembrane helix of the lhca subunit are important for formation of stable heterodimeric light harvesting complex lhci
photosynthetic light harvesting complexes lhcs are assembled from apoproteins lhc proteins and non covalently attached pigments despite a considerable amino acid sequence identity these proteins differ in their oligomerization behavior to identify the amino acid residues determining the heterodimerization of lhca and lhca to form lhci   we mutated the poorly conserved second transmembrane helix of the two subunits mutated genes were expressed in escherichia coli and the resultant proteins were refolded in vitro and subsequently analyzed by gel electrophoresis replacement of the entire second helix in lhca by the one of lhca abolished heterodimerization whereas it had no effect in lhca  individual replacement of three amino acid clusters in lhca that deviate from the corresponding sequence of lhca  demonstrated their contribution to lhca lhca dimerization further dissection by mutation of individual amino acid residues in lhca showed the importance of a serine phenylalanine and histidine s  f  h  for lhci   assembly alignment of consensus sequences of the lhc proteins demonstrated that these amino acids are predominantly unique in lhca at the relevant positions construction of a homology model based on the high resolution structure of lhcii and superimposing these models onto the photosystem i structure suggested an orientation of s  f  and h  toward the third transmembrane helix of lhca  since some of the amino acids are too far apart from their nearest neighbors in lhca for a direct interaction different modes of interaction are discussed finally by quantifying chlorophylls bound to monomeric lhc obtained with the h  mutant we identified this amino acid as a further chlorophyll binding site
