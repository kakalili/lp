the high resolution structures of free and inhibitor bound trypanosoma rangeli sialidase and its comparison with t cruzitrans sialidase
the structure of the recombinant trypanosoma rangeli sialidase trsa has been determined at    resolution and the structures of its complexes with the transition state analog inhibitor  deoxy   dehydro n acetyl neuraminic acid dana  neu  ac thio     galactoside natg and n acetylneuraminic acid nana have been determined at        and     respectively the d structure of trsa is essentially identical to that of the natural enzyme except for the absence of covalently attached sugar at five distinct n glycosylation sites the protein exhibits a topologically rigid active site architecture that is unaffected by ligand binding the overall binding of dana to the active site cleft is similar to that observed for other viral and bacterial sialidases dominated by the interactions of the inhibitor carboxylate with the conserved arginine triad however the interactions of the other pyranoside ring substituents hydroxyl n acetyl and glycerol moieties differ between trypanosomal bacterial and viral sialidases providing a structural basis for specific inhibitor design sialic acid is found to bind the enzyme with the sugar ring in a distorted half chair or boat conformation and the  oh hydroxyl group at hydrogen bonding distance of the carboxylate of asp  substantiating a direct catalytic role for this residue a detailed comparison of trsa with the closely related structure of t cruzitrans sialidase tcts reveals a highly conserved catalytic center where subtle structural differences account for strikingly different enzymatic activities and inhibition properties the structure of trsa in complex with natg shows the active site cleft occupied by a smaller compound which could be identified as dana probably the product of a hydrolytic side reaction indeed trsa but not tcts was found to cleave o and s linked sialylated substrates further stressing the functional differences between trypanosomal sialidases and trans sialidases
