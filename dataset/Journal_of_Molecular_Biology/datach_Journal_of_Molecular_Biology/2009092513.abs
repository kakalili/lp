insights into the biosynthesis of the vibrio cholerae major autoinducer cai  from the crystal structure of the plp dependent enzyme cqsa
cqsa is an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of cholerae autoinducer  cai   the major vibrio cholerae autoinducer engaged in quorum sensing the amino acid sequence of cqsa suggests that it belongs to the family of  oxoamine synthases that catalyse the condensation of an amino acid to an acyl coa substrate here we present the apo and plp bound crystal structures of cqsa and confirm that it shares structural homology with the dimeric  oxoamine synthases including a conserved plp binding site the chemical structure of cai  suggests that decanoyl coa may be one substrate of cqsa and that another substrate may be l threonine or l  aminobutyric acid a crystal structure of cqsa at    resolution obtained in the presence of plp and l threonine reveals an external aldimine that has lost the l threonine side chain similarly a    resolution crystal structure of cqsa in the presence of plp l threonine and decanoyl coa shows a trapped external aldimine intermediate suggesting that the condensation and decarboxylation steps have occurred again with loss of the l threonine side chain it is suggested that this side chain loss an observation supported by mass spectrometry is due to a retro aldol reaction although no structural data have been obtained on cqsa using l  aminobutyric acid and decanoyl coa as substrates mass spectrometry confirms the expected product of the enzyme reaction it is proposed that a region of structure that is disordered in the apo structure is involved in the release of product while not confirming if cqsa alone is able to synthesize cai  these results suggest possible synthetic routes
