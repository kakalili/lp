shigella flexneri spa  crystal structure verified in solution by double electron electron resonance
shigella flexneri spa  is a chaperone of the type  secretion system which binds a number of effectors to ensure their stabilization prior to secretion one of these effectors is ipgb  a mimic of the human ras like rho guanosine triphosphatase rhog in this study spa  alone and in complex with ipgb has been studied by double electron electron resonance an experiment that gives distance information showing the spacial separation of attached spin labels this distance is explained by determining the crystal structure of the spin labeled spa  where labels are seen to be buried in hydrophobic pockets the double electron electron resonance experiment on the spa  complex with ipgb shows that ipgb does not bind spa  in the same way as is seen in the homologous salmonella sp chaperone effector complex invb sipa
