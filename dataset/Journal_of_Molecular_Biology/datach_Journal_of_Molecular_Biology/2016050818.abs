evolution and characterization of a new reversibly photoswitching chromogenic protein dathail
we report the engineering of a new reversibly switching chromogenic protein dathail dathail was evolved from the extremely thermostable fluorescent proteins thermal green protein tgp and ecgp  using directed evolution and ratiometric sorting dathail has two spectrally distinct chromogenic states with low quantum yields corresponding to absorbance in a ground state with a maximum at  nm and a photo induced metastable state with a maximum at  nm in contrast to all previously described photoswitchable proteins both spectral states of dathail are non fluorescent the photo induced chromogenic state of dathail has a lifetime of  min at  k and ph  as measured by uv  vis spectrophotometry returning to the ground state through thermal relaxation x ray crystallography provided structural insights supporting a change in conformation and coordination in the chromophore pocket as being responsible for dathail s photoswitching neutron crystallography carried out for the first time on a protein from the green fluorescent protein family showed a distribution of hydrogen atoms revealing protonation of the chromophore  hydroxybenzyl group in the ground state the neutron structure also supports the hypothesis that the photo induced proton transfer from the chromophore occurs through water mediated proton relay into the bulk solvent beyond its spectroscopic curiosity dathail has several characteristics that are improvements for applications including low background fluorescence large spectral separation rapid switching time and the ability to switch many times therefore dathail is likely to be extremely useful in the quickly developing fields of imaging and biosensors including photochromic f rster resonance energy transfer high resolution microscopy and live tracking within the cell
