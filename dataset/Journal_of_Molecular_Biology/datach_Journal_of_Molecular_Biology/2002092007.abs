structure and stability of wild type and mutant rna internal loops from the sl  domain of the hiv  packaging signal
the packaging signal   of the human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  enables encapsidation of the full length genomic rna against a background of a vast excess of cellular mrnas the core hiv   is approximately   nucleotides and contains sequences critical for viral genomic dimerisation and splicing in addition to the packaging signal it consists of a series of stem loops termed sl  to sl   which can be arranged in a cloverleaf secondary structure using a combination of nmr spectroscopy uv melting experiments molecular modeling and phylogenetic analyses we have explored the structure of two conserved internal loops proximal to the palindromic sequence of sl  internal loop a composed of six purines forms a flexible structure that is strikingly similar to the rev responsive element motif when bound to rev protein this result suggests that it may function as a protein binding site the absolutely conserved four purine internal loop b is instead conformationally and thermodynamically unstable and exhibits multiple conformations in solution by introducing a double agg to gga mutation within this loop its conformation is stabilised to form a new intra molecular g a g base triplet the structure of the gga mutant explains the relative instability of the wild type loop in a manner analogous to sl  we propose that conformational flexibility at this site may facilitate melting of the structure during gag protein capture or genomic rna dimerisation
