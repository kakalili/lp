two targets in pcf  dna for prgx binding their role in production of qa and prgx mrna and in regulation of pheromone inducible conjugation edited by m gottesman
prgx is the primary cytoplasmic protein involved in negative control of pheromone inducible conjugation functions of the enterococcus faecalis plasmid pcf  prgx is believed to act in concert with an antisense rna called qa to inhibit readthrough of transcription from the prgq promoter into the pcf  genes mediating conjugation functions prgx also positively regulates its own expression as well as that of qa we found two dna target sites for prgx binding in the intergenic region between the prgx and prgq genes of pcf  the primary binding site near prgx includes an  bp palindromic sequence and showed relatively high affinity for his tagged prgx his prgx  the secondary binding site is between the    and    regions of the prgq promoter and contains only a half of the palindromic sequence this binding site showed weaker affinity a region of pcf  including the prgq promoter and the secondary binding site reduced qa rna levels greatly and this reduction was overcome by the presence of the primary binding site and prgx in constructs where the binding sites were mutated individually or in combination the intracellular levels of prgx protein and qa rna were reduced significantly on the basis of these results we propose that both dna binding sites are required for the autoregulation of prgx expression and for positive regulation of qa rna
