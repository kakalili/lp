the expression level of the chromatin associated hmgb protein influences growth stress tolerance and transcriptome in arabidopsis
high mobility group hmg proteins of the hmgb family are small and relatively abundant chromatin associated proteins as architectural factors the hmgb proteins are involved in the regulation of transcription and other dna dependent processes we have examined arabidopsis mutant plants lacking the hmgb protein which is a typical representative of the plant hmgb family in addition our analyses included transgenic plants overexpressing hmgb and mutant plants that were transformed with the hmgb genomic region complementation plants  as well as control plants both the absence and overexpression of hmgb caused shorter primary roots and affected the sensitivity towards the genotoxic agent methyl methanesulfonate the overexpression of hmgb decreased the seed germination rate in the presence of elevated concentrations of nacl the complementation plants that expressed hmgb at wild type levels did not show phenotypic differences compared to the control plants transcript profiling by microarray hybridization revealed that a remarkably large number of genes were differentially expressed up and down regulated in plants lacking hmgb compared to control plants among the down regulated genes the gene ontology category of stress responsive genes was overrepresented neither microscopic analyses nor micrococcal nuclease digestion experiments revealed notable differences in overall chromatin structure when comparing chromatin from hmgb deficient and control plants collectively our results show that despite the presence of several other hmgb proteins the lack and overexpression of hmgb affect certain aspects of plant growth and stress tolerance and it has a marked impact on the transcriptome suggesting that hmgb has partially specialized functions in arabidopsis
