distinct requirements for heparin and  dystroglycan binding revealed by structure based mutagenesis of the laminin   lg  lg domain pair
laminin        is found in basement membranes surrounding muscle and peripheral nerve cells several types of cellular receptors bind to the laminin g like lg domains at the c terminus of the   chain the interaction with  dystroglycan   dg being particularly important in muscle we have used site directed mutagenesis and in vitro binding assays to map the binding sites on the laminin   chain lg  lg domain pair for  dg heparin and sulfatides calcium dependent  dg recognition requires the calcium ion in lg  but not the one in lg  as well as basic residues in both lg domains heparin and sulfatides also bind to basic residues in both lg domains but there is little overlap in the binding sites for  dg and heparin sulfatides the results should prove useful for the molecular dissection of laminin  receptor interactions in vivo
