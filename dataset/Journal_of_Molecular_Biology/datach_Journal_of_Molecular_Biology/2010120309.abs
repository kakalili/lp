gradual adaptive changes of a protein facing high salt concentrations
several experimental techniques were applied to unravel fine molecular details of protein adaptation to high salinity we compared four homologous enzymes which suggested a new halo adaptive state in the process of molecular adaptation to high salt conditions together with comparative functional studies the structure of malate dehydrogenase from the eubacterium salinibacter ruber shows that the enzyme shares characteristics of a halo adapted archaea bacterial enzyme and of non halo adapted enzymes from other eubacterial species the s ruber enzyme is active at the high physiological concentrations of kcl but unlike typical halo adapted enzymes remains folded and active at low salt concentrations structural aspects of the protein including acidic residues at the surface solvent exposed hydrophobic surface and buried hydrophobic surface place it between the typical halo adapted and non halo adapted proteins the enzyme lacks inter subunit ion binding sites often seen in halo adapted enzymes these observations permit us to suggest an evolutionary pathway that is highlighted by subtle trade offs to achieve an optimal compromise among solubility stability and catalytic activity
