specific interaction of the potassium channel  subunit mink with the sarcomeric protein t cap suggests a t tubule myofibril linking system edited by j karn
ion channel  subunits are ancillary proteins that co assemble with  subunits to modulate gating kinetics and enhance stability of multimeric channel complexes they provide binding sites for other regulatory proteins and are medically important as the targets of many pharmacological compounds mink is the  subunit of the slow activating component of the delayed rectifier potassium current iks channel and associates with the  subunit kvlqt  we report here that mink specifically interacts with the sarcomeric z line component t cap also called telethonin  in vitro interaction studies indicated that the cytoplasmic domain of mink specifically binds to the sixteen c terminal residues of t cap these residues are sufficient for its interaction with mink consistent with our in vitro studies immunofluorescence staining followed by confocal analysis revealed that both mink and t cap are localized within the z line region in cardiac muscle striated staining of mink was observed in non washed membrane intact cardiac myofibrils but not in well washed membrane removed cardiac myofibrils suggesting that mink localizes on t tubular membranes surrounding the z line in the inner ventricular myocardium together with our previous data on the colocalization and interaction of t cap with the n terminus of the giant protein titin in the periphery of the z line these data suggest that t cap functions as an adapter protein to link together myofibrillar components with the membranous  subunit of the iks channel we speculate that this interaction may contribute to a stretch dependent regulation of potassium flux in cardiac muscle providing a  mechano electrical feedback  system
