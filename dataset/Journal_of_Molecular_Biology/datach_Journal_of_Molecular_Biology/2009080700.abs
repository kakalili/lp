structural and functional analysis of the globular head domain of p  provides insight into membrane tethering
molecular tethers have a central role in the organization of the complex membrane architecture of eukaryotic cells p  is a ubiquitous essential tether involved in vesicle transport and the structural organization of the exocytic pathway we describe two crystal structures of the n terminal domain of p  at     resolution the p  structures show a novel  solenoid architecture constructed of  armadillo like tether repeat   helical tripod motifs we find that the h tr binds the rab gtpase involved in endoplasmic reticulum to golgi transport mutation of the h motif results in the dominant negative inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum to golgi trafficking we propose that the h helical tripod contributes to the assembly of rab dependent complexes responsible for the tether and snare dependent fusion of membranes
