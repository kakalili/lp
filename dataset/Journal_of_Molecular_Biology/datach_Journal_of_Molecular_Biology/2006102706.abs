the structure of apo wild type cellular retinoic acid binding protein ii at     and its relationship to ligand binding and nuclear translocation
crabpii is a small cytosolic protein that solubilizes and transfers retinoic acid ra to the nucleus while also enhancing its transcriptional activity we have determined the first high resolution structure of apo wild type wt crabpii at      using three different data sets collected on apo wt crabpii we have shown that apo and holo crabpii share very similar structures binding of ra appears to increase the overall rigidity of the structure although the induced structural changes are not as pronounced as previously thought the enhanced structural rigidity may be an important determinant for the enhanced nuclear localization of the ra bound protein comparison of our apo wt with a mutant apo crabpii structure shows that mutation of arg   a conserved residue of crabpii and a key residue in ra binding causes structural changes in the molecule we further investigated the structural importance of conserved residues by determining the structure of the f w mutant crabpii f w crabpii  our structures also demonstrate structural changes induced by crystal packing and show that a crystal can harbor demonstrative structural differences in the asymmetric unit
