modulation of the interaction between neurotensin receptor nts and gq protein by lipid
membrane lipids have been implicated to influence the activity of g protein coupled receptors gpcrs  almost all of our knowledge on the role of lipids on gpcr and g protein function comes from work on the visual pigment rhodopsin and its g protein transducin which reside in a highly specialized membrane environment thus insight gained from rhodopsin signaling may not be simply translated to other nonvisual gpcrs here we investigated the effect of lipid head group charges on the signal transduction properties of the class a gpcr neurotensin nt receptor  nts  under defined experimental conditions using self assembled phospholipid nanodiscs prepared with the zwitter ionic lipid  palmitoyl  oleoyl sn glycero  phosphocholine popc  the negatively charged  palmitoyl  oleoyl sn glycero  phospho    rac glycerol  popg  or a popc popg mixture a combination of dynamic light scattering and sedimentation velocity showed that nts was monomeric in popc  popc popg  and popg nanodiscs binding of the agonist nt to nts occurred with similar affinities and was essentially unaffected by the phospholipid composition in contrast gq protein coupling to nts in various lipid nanodiscs was significantly different and the apparent affinity of g q and g    to activated nts increased with increasing popg content nts catalyzed gdp gtp s nucleotide exchange at g q in the presence of g    and nt was crucially affected by the lipid type with exchange rates higher by  or  orders of magnitude in popc popg and popg nanodiscs respectively compared to popc nanodiscs our data demonstrate that negatively charged lipids in the immediate vicinity of a nonvisual gpcr modulate the g protein coupling step
