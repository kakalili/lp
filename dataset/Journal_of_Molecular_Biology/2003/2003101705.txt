DNA cleavage by the type III restriction endonuclease EcoP1I was analysed on circular and catenane DNA in a variety of buffers with different salts. In the presence of the cofactor S-adenosyl methionine (AdoMet), and irrespective of buffer, only substrates with two EcoP1I sites in inverted repeat were susceptible to cleavage. Maximal activity was achieved at a Res2Mod2 to site ratio of ∼1:1 yet resulted in cleavage at only one of the two sites. In contrast, the outcome of reactions in the absence of AdoMet was dependent upon the identity of the monovalent buffer components, in particular the identity of the cation. With Na+, cleavage was observed only on substrates with two sites in inverted repeat at elevated enzyme to site ratios (&gt;15:1). However, with K+ every substrate tested was susceptible to cleavage above an enzyme to site ratio of ∼3:1, including a DNA molecule with two directly repeated sites and even a DNA molecule with a single site. Above an enzyme to site ratio of 2:1, substrates with two sites in inverted repeat were cleaved at both cognate sites. The rates of cleavage suggested two separate events: a fast primary reaction for the first cleavage of a pair of inverted sites; and an order-of-magnitude slower secondary reaction for the second cleavage of the pair or for the first cleavage of all other site combinations. EcoP1I enzymes mutated in either the ATPase or nuclease motifs did not produce the secondary cleavage reactions. Thus, AdoMet appears to play a dual role in type III endonuclease reactions: Firstly, as an allosteric activator, promoting DNA association; and secondly, as a “specificity factor”, ensuring that cleavage occurs only when two endonucleases bind two recognition sites in a designated orientation. However, given the right conditions, AdoMet is not strictly required for DNA cleavage by a type III enzyme.
