crystal structure of the  oxoglutarate and fe ii dependent lysyl hydroxylase jmjd
lysyl and prolyl hydroxylations are well known post translational modifications to animal and plant proteins with extracellular roles more recent work has indicated that the hydroxylation of intracellular animal proteins may be common jmjd catalyses the iron and  oxoglutarate dependent hydroxylation of lysyl residues in arginine  serine rich domains of rna splicing related proteins we report crystallographic studies on the catalytic domain of jmjd in complex with ni ii substituting for fe ii  together with mutational studies the structural data suggest how jmjd binds its lysyl residues such that it can catalyse c  hydroxylation rather than n  demethylation as for analogous enzymes
