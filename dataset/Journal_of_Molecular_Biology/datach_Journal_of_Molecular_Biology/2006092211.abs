structure of a hyper cleavable monomeric fragment of phage  repressor containing the cleavage site region
the key event in the switch from lysogenic to lytic growth of phage lambda is the self cleavage of lambda repressor which is induced by the formation of a reca ssdna atp filament at a site of dna damage lambda repressor cleaves itself at the peptide bond between ala  and gly   but only when bound as a monomer to the reca ssdna atp filament here we have designed a hyper cleavable fragment of lambda repressor containing the hinge and c terminal domain residues       in which the monomer  monomer interface is disrupted by two point mutations and a deletion of seven residues at the c terminus this fragment crystallizes as a monomer and its structure has been determined to     resolution the hinge region which bears the cleavage site is folded over the active site of the c terminal oligomerization domain ctd but with the cleavage site flipped out and exposed to solvent thus the structure represents a non cleavable conformation of the repressor but one that is poised for cleavage after modest rearrangements that are presumably stabilized by binding to reca the structure provides a unique snapshot of lambda repressor in a conformation that sheds light on how its self cleavage is tempered in the absence of reca as well as a framework for interpreting previous genetic and biochemical data concerning the reca mediated cleavage reaction
