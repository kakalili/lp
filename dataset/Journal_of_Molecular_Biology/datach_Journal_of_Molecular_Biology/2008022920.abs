correlation between shiftide activity and hiv  integrase inhibition by a peptide selected from a combinatorial library
the human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  integrase in protein is an emerging target for the development of anti hiv drugs we recently described a new approach for inhibiting in by  shiftides   peptides that inhibit the protein by shifting its oligomerization equilibrium from the active dimer to the inactive tetramer in this study we used the yeast two hybrid system with the hiv  in as a bait and a combinatorial peptide aptamer library as a prey to select peptides of  amino acids that specifically bind in five non homologous peptides designated as in  to in  were selected elisa studies confirmed that in binds the free peptides all the five peptides interact with in with comparable affinity kd     m  as was revealed by fluorescence anisotropy studies only one peptide in  inhibited the enzymatic activity of in in vitro and the hiv  replication in cultured cells in correlation fluorescence anisotropy binding experiments revealed that of the five peptides only the inhibitory in  inhibited the dna binding of in analytical gel filtration experiments revealed that only the in  and not the four other peptides shifted the oligomerization equilibrium of in towards the tetramer thus the results show a distinct correlation between the ability of the selected peptides to inhibit in activity and that to shift its oligomerization equilibrium
