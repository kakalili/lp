single molecule force spectroscopy reveals a weakly populated microstate of the fniii domains of tenascin
the native states of proteins exist as an ensemble of conformationally similar microstates the fluctuations among different microstates are of great importance for the functions and structural stability of proteins here we demonstrate that single molecule atomic force microscopy afm can be used to directly probe the existence of multiple folded microstates we used the afm to repeatedly stretch and relax a recombinant tenascin fragment tnfnall to allow the fibronectin type iii fniii domains to undergo repeated unfolding refolding cycles in addition to the native state we discovered that some fniii domains can refold from the unfolded state into a previously unrecognized microstate n state this novel state is conformationally similar to the native state but mechanically less stable the native state unfolds at     pn while the n state unfolds at    pn these two distinct populations of microstates constitute the ensemble of the folded states for some fniii domains an unfolded fniii domain can fold into either one of the two microstates via two distinct folding routes these results reveal the dynamic and heterogeneous picture of the folded ensemble for some fniii domains of tenascin which may carry important implications for the mechanical functions of tenascins in vivo
