thermodynamics of e coli cytidine repressor interactions with dna distinct modes of binding to different operators suggests a role in differential gene regulation edited by d draper
interactions between the escherichia coli cytidine repressor protein cytr and its operator sites at the different promoters that comprise the cytr regulon play an important role in the regulation of these promoters the natural operators are palindromes separated by variable length central spacers   bp  we have suggested that this variability affects the flexibility of cytr dna contacts thereby affecting the critical protein protein interactions between cytr and the camp receptor protein crp that underlie differential repression and activation of cytr regulated genes to assess this hypothesis we investigated the thermodynamics of cytr binding to the natural operator sequences found in udpp and deop  to separate effects due to spacing from effects due to the differing sequences of the recognition half sites of these two operators we also investigated cytr binding to artificial hybrid operators in which the half site sequences of udpp and deop were exchanged thermodynamic parameters  s   h  and  c p were determined by van  t hoff analysis of cytr binding monitored by changes in the steady state fluorescence anisotropy of dye conjugated operator containing oligonucleotides large differences in thermodynamics were observed that depend primarily on the central spacer rather than the sequences of the recognition half sites binding to operators with deop spacing results in a very large negative  c p association is strongly favored enthalpically and strongly disfavored entropically at ambient temperature by contrast binding to operators with udpp spacing results in a small negative  c p association is weakly favored both enthalpically and entropically at ambient temperature a difference of such magnitude in   c p has not been reported previously for specific binding of a transcription factor to different sites the identical salt dependence of cytr binding to deop and udpp operators indicates that ion dependent processes do not contribute significantly to this difference thus the different thermodynamic effects appear to reflect distinctly different modes of site specific dna binding we discuss similarities to operator binding by cytr homologs among laci family repressors and we consider how different cytr binding modes might affect interactions with other components of the gene regulatory machinery that contribute to differential gene regulation
