neuroprotective and nootropic drug noopept rescues  synuclein amyloid cytotoxicity
parkinson s disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by  synuclein   syn containing lewy body formation and selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra we have demonstrated the modulating effect of noopept a novel proline containing dipeptide drug with nootropic and neuroprotective properties on  syn oligomerization and fibrillation by using thioflavin t fluorescence far uv cd and atomic force microscopy techniques noopept does not bind to a sterically specific site in the  syn molecule as revealed by heteronuclear two dimensional nmr analysis but due to hydrophobic interactions with toxic amyloid oligomers it prompts their rapid sequestration into larger fibrillar amyloid aggregates consequently this process rescues the cytotoxic effect of amyloid oligomers on neuroblastoma sh sy y cells as demonstrated by using cell viability assays and fluorescent staining of apoptotic and necrotic cells and by assessing the level of intracellular oxidative stress the mitigating effect of noopept against amyloid oligomeric cytotoxicity may offer additional benefits to the already well established therapeutic functions of this new pharmaceutical
