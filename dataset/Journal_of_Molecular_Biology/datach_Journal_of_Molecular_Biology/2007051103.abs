biophysical characterization of structural properties and folding of interleukin  receptor antagonist
structural properties and folding of interleukin  receptor antagonist il ra  a therapeutically important cytokine with a symmetric  trefoil topology are characterized using optical spectroscopy high resolution nmr and size exclusion chromatography spectral contributions of two tryptophan residues trp  and trp   present in the wild type protein have been determined from mutational analysis trp  dominates the emission spectrum of il ra while trp  is quenched presumably by the nearby cysteine residues in both folded and unfolded states the same trp  gives rise to two characteristic negative peaks in the aromatic cd urea denaturation of the wild type protein is probed by measuring intrinsic and extrinsic binding of  anilinonaphthalene  sulfonic acid fluorescence near and far uv cd and d and d  h   n heteronuclear single quantum coherence hsqc  nmr overall the data suggest an essentially two state equilibrium denaturation mechanism with small but detectable structural changes within the pretransition region the majority of the h   n hsqc cross peaks of the folded state show only a limited chemical shift change as a function of the denaturant concentration however the amide cross peak of leu  demonstrates a significant urea dependence that can be fitted to a two state binding model with a dissociation constant of       m this interaction has at least a five times higher affinity than reported values for nonspecific urea binding to denatured proteins and peptides suggesting that the structural context around leu  stabilizes the protein  urea interaction a possible role of denaturant binding in inducing the pretransition changes in il ra is discussed urea unfolding of wild type il ra is sufficiently slow to enable hplc separation of folded and unfolded states quantitative size exclusion chromatography has provided a hydrodynamic view of the kinetic denaturation process thermodynamic stability and unfolding kinetics of il ra resemble those of structurally and evolutionary close il   suggesting similarity of their free energy landscapes
