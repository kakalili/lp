structures and free energy landscapes of the wild type and mutants of the a     peptide are determined by an interplay between intrapeptide electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions
the initial events in protein aggregation involve fluctuations that populate monomer conformations which lead to oligomerization and fibril assembly the highly populated structures driven by a balance between hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions in the protease resistant wild type a     peptide and mutants e q dutch  d n iowa  and k n are analyzed using molecular dynamics simulations intrapeptide electrostatic interactions were connected to calculated pka values that compare well with the experimental estimates the pka values of the titratable residues show that e  and d  side chains form salt bridges only infrequently with the k  side chain contacts between e   k  are more probable in  dried  salt bridges whereas d   k  contacts are more probable in solvated salt bridges the strength of the intrapeptide hydrophobic interactions increases as d n lt wt lt e q lt k a free energy profiles and disconnectivity representation of the energy landscapes show that the monomer structures partition into four distinct basins the hydrophobic interactions cluster the a     peptide into two basins differentiated by the relative position of the dvg     and gsn     fragments about the g  residue the e q mutation increases the population with intact vgsn turn compared to the wild type wt peptide the increase in the population of the structures in the aggregation prone basin i in e q which occurs solely due to the difference in charge states between the dutch mutant and the wt gives a structural explanation of the somewhat larger aggregation rate in the mutant the d n mutation dramatically reduces the intrapeptide interactions the k a mutation increases the intrapeptide hydrophobic interactions that promote population of structures in basin i and basin ii whose structures are characterized by hydrophobic interaction between v  and k  side chains but with well separated ends of the backbone atoms in the vgsn turn the intrapeptide electrostatic interactions in the wt and e q peptides roughen the free energy surface compared to the k a peptide the d n mutation has a flat free energy surface corresponding to an increased population of random coil like structures with weak hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions we propose that mutations or sequences that enhance the probability of occupying basin i would promote aggregation of a  peptides
