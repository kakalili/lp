the structure and thermal motion of the b     lh complex from rps acidophila at    resolution and  k new structural features and functionally relevant motions
the structure at  k of integral membrane light harvesting complex ii lh  from rhodopseudomonas acidophila strain    has been refined to    resolution the electron density has been significantly improved compared to the    resolution map by high resolution data cryo cooling and translation libration screw tls refinement the electron density reveals a second carotenoid molecule the last five c terminal residues of the  chain and a carboxy modified  met which forms the ligand of the b  bacteriochlorophyll tls refinement has enabled the characterisation of displacements between molecules in the complex b  bacteriochlorophyll molecules are arranged in a ring of  pigments composed of nine approximate dimers these pigments are strongly coupled and at their equilibrium positions the excited state dipole interaction energies within and between dimers are    cm   and  cm   respectively this difference in coupling energy is similar in magnitude to changes in interaction energies arising from the pigment displacements described by tls tensors the displacements appear to be non random in nature and appear to be designed to optimise the modulation of pigment energy interactions this is the first time that lh pigment displacements have been quantified experimentally the calculated energy changes indicate that there may be significant contributions to inter pigment energy interactions from molecular displacements and these may be of importance to photosynthetic energy transfer
