electron microscopic evidence in support of  solenoid models of proteasomal subunits rpn and rpn
rpn    kda and rpn    kda are components of the  s regulatory complex of the proteasome the central portions of both proteins are predicted to have toroidal  solenoid folds composed of    proteasome cyclosome repeats each    residues long and containing two  helices and turns a v kajava j biol chem              to evaluate this prediction we examined the full length yeast proteins and truncated versions thereof consisting only of the repeat containing regions by gel filtration cd spectroscopy and negative staining electron microscopy em  all four proteins are monomeric in solution and highly  helical particularly the truncated ones the em data were analyzed by image classification and averaging techniques the preponderant projections in each case show near annular molecules    nm in diameter comparison of the full length with the truncated proteins showed molecules similar in size and shape indicating that their terminal regions are flexible and thus smeared to invisibility in the averaged images we tested the toroidal model further by calculating resolution limited projections and comparing them with the em images the results support the  solenoid model except that they indicate that the repeats are organized not as symmetrical circular toroids but in less regular horseshoe like structures
