the role of protein sequence and amino acid composition in amyloid formation scrambling and backward reading of iapp amyloid fibrils
the specific functional structure of natural proteins is determined by the way in which amino acids are sequentially connected in the polypeptide the tight sequence structure relationship governing protein folding does not seem to apply to amyloid fibril formation because many proteins without any sequence relationship have been shown to assemble into very similar  sheet enriched structures here we have characterized the aggregation kinetics seeding ability morphology conformation stability and toxicity of amyloid fibrils formed by a  residue domain of the islet amyloid polypeptide iapp  as well as of a backward and scrambled version of this peptide the three iapp peptides readily aggregate into ordered   sheet enriched amyloid like fibrils however the mechanism of formation and the structural and functional properties of aggregates formed from these three peptides are different in such a way that they do not cross seed each other despite sharing a common amino acid composition the results confirm that as for globular proteins highly specific polypeptide sequential traits govern the assembly pathway final fine structure and cytotoxic properties of amyloid conformations
