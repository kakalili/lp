kinetic analysis of the interactions between troponin c and the c terminal troponin i regulatory region and validation of a new peptide delivery capture system used for surface plasmon resonance
using surface plasmon resonance spr based biosensor analysis and fluorescence spectroscopy the apparent kinetic constants kon and koff and equilibrium dissociation constant kd have been determined for the binding interaction between rabbit skeletal troponin c tnc and rabbit skeletal troponin i tni regulatory region peptides tni     tni     and tni     to carry out spr analysis a new peptide delivery capture system was utilized in which the tni peptides were conjugated to the e coil strand of a de novo designed heterodimeric coiled coil domain the tni peptide conjugates were then captured via dimerization to the opposite strand k coil  which was immobilized on the biosensor surface tnc was then injected over the biosensor surface for quantitative binding analysis for fluorescence spectroscopy analysis the environmentally sensitive fluoroprobe     iodoacetyl amino ethyl amino naphthalene  sulfonic acid   iaedans was covalently linked to cys  of tnc and free tni peptides were added spr analysis yielded equilibrium dissociation constants for tnc plus ca  binding to the c terminal tni regulatory peptides tni     and tni     of  nm and  nm respectively the apparent association and dissociation rate constants for each interaction were kon     m  s       m  s   and koff      s         s   for tni     and tni     peptides respectively these results were consistent with those obtained by fluorescence spectroscopy analysis kd being equal to  nm and  nm for tnc  tni     and tnc  tni     respectively interestingly although the inhibitory region peptide tni     was observed to bind with an affinity similar to that of tni     by fluorescence analysis kd  nm  its binding was not detected by spr subsequent investigations examining salt effects suggested that the binding mechanism for the inhibitory region peptide is best characterized by an electrostatically driven fast on rate      to    m  s   and a fast off rate      s    taken together the determination of these kinetic rate constants permits a clearer view of the interactions between the tnc and tni proteins of the troponin complex
