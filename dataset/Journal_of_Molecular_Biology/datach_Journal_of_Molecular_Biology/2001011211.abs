crystal structure of soybean proglycinin a ab b homotrimer
soybean glycinin is a member of the  s globulin family the crystal structure of proglycinin was determined by x ray crystallography at    resolution with an r factor of    and a free r factor of    a trimer molecule was found in an asymmetric unit of crystals the trimer model contains three a ab b subunits and comprises   amino acid residues and  water molecules the constituent protomers of the homo trimeric protein are arranged around a  fold symmetry axis with dimensions of          the protomer model is composed of five fragments which correspond roughly to conserved regions based on the sequence alignment of various  s globulins the core of the protomer consists of two jelly roll  barrels and two extended helix domains this structure of proglycinin is similar to those of canavalin and phaseolin belonging to the s globulin family strongly supporting the hypothesis that both s and  s globulins are derived from a common ancestor the inter and intra chain disulfide bonds conserved in the  s globulin family are clearly observed it is found that the face with the inter chain disulfide bond ie face contains more hydrophobic residues than that with the intra chain disulfide bond this suggests that a mature hexamer is formed by the interaction between the ie faces after processing
