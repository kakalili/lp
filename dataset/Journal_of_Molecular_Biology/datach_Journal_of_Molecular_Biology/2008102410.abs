structural insight into ph induced conformational changes within the native human transthyretin tetramer
acidification of the transthyretin ttr tetramer facilitates dissociation and conformational changes in the protein allowing alternatively folded monomers to self assemble into insoluble amyloid fibers by a downhill polymerization mechanism in vitro to investigate the influence of acidification on the quaternary and tertiary structures of ttr crystal structures of wild type human ttr at ph   and ph   have been determined to     resolution the acidic ph crystals are isomorphous to most of the previously reported ttr structures containing two subunits in the asymmetric unit the so called a and b subunits but forming a tetramer through crystallographic symmetry the ph   crystal structure reveals that the native fold of the tetramer remains mostly undisturbed in particular subunit a of the ttr ph   structure is very similar to the wild type ttr ph   structure with an r m s d of      in contrast subunit b of the ttr ph   structure exhibits several significant changes the ef helix residues     and the adjacent ef loop residues     show an r m s d greater than     the acidic residues within this region glu  asp  glu  and glu  undergo significant conformational changes that instigate movement of the ef helix  loop region and make residues lys  lys  his  and his  orient their side chains toward these acidic residues in particular glu  undergoes a maximum deviation of     occupying phe  s initial position in the wild type ttr ph   structure and points its side chain into a hydrophobic pocket of the neighboring subunit in the ph   structure the ef helix  loop region is completely disordered these results demonstrate that acidic conditions increase the susceptibility of the ef helix  loop region of the ttr b subunit to undergo conformational changes and unfold likely destabilizing the tetramer and identifying at least the initial conformational changes likely occurring within the tetramer that leads to the amyloidogenic monomer
