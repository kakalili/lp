rough energy landscapes in protein folding dimeric e colitrp repressor folds through three parallel channels edited by p e wright
the folding mechanism of the dimeric escherichia coli trp repressor tr is a kinetically complex process that involves three distinguishable stages of development following the formation of a partially folded monomeric ensemble of species within  ms folding to the native dimer is controlled by three kinetic phases the rate limiting step in each phase is either a non proline isomerization reaction or a dimerization reaction depending on the final denaturant concentration two approaches have been employed to test the previously proposed folding mechanism of tr through three parallel channels   unfolding double jump experiments demonstrate that all three folding channels lead directly to native dimer and   the differential stabilization of the transition state for the final step in folding and the native dimer by the addition of salt shows that all three channels involve isomerization of a dimeric species a refined model for the folding of trp repressor is presented in which all three channels involve a rapid dimerization reaction between partially folded monomers followed by the isomerization of the dimeric intermediates to yield native dimer the ensemble of partially folded monomers can be captured at equilibrium by low ph one dimensional proton nmr spectra at ph   demonstrate that monomers exist in two distinct slowly interconverting conformations these data provide a potential structural explanation for the three channel folding mechanism of tr random association of two different monomeric forms which are distinguished by alternative packing modes of the core dimerization domain and the dna binding helix turn helix domain one perhaps both of these packing modes contains non native contacts
