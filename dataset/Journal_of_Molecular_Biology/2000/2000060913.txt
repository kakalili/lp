Initiation factor 3 (IF3) acts to switch the decoding preference of the small ribosomal subunit from elongator to initiator tRNA. The effects of IF3 on the 30 S ribosomal subunit and on the 30 S·mRNA·tRNAfMet complex were determined by UV-induced RNA crosslinking. Three intramolecular crosslinks in the 16 S rRNA (of the 14 that were monitored by gel electrophoresis) are affected by IF3. These are the crosslinks between C1402 and C1501 within the decoding region, between C967×C1400 joining the end loop of a helix of 16 S rRNA domain III and the decoding region, and between U793 and G1517 joining the 790 end loop of 16 S rRNA domain II and the end loop of the terminal helix. These changes occur even in the 30 S·IF3 complex, indicating they are not mediated through tRNAfMet or mRNA. UV-induced crosslinks occur between 16 S rRNA position C1400 and tRNAfMet position U34, in tRNAfMet the nucleotide adjacent to the 5′ anticodon nucleotide, and between 16 S rRNA position C1397 and the mRNA at positions +9 and +10 (where A of the initiator AUG codon is +1). The presence of IF3 reduces both of these crosslinks by twofold and fourfold, respectively. The binding site for IF3 involves the 790 region, some other parts of the 16 S rRNA domain II and the terminal stem/loop region. These are located in the front bottom part of the platform structure in the 30 S subunit, a short distance from the decoding region. The changes that occur in the decoding region, even in the absence of mRNA and tRNA, may be induced by IF3 from a short distance or could be caused by the second IF3 structural domain.
