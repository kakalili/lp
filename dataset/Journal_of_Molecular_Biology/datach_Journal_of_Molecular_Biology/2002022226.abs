analysis of rous sarcoma virus capsid protein variants assembled on lipid monolayers edited by m f summers
during assembly and morphogenesis of rous sarcoma virus rsv  proteolytic processing of the structural precursor pr gag protein generates three capsid ca protein variants ca   ca   and ca   the proteins share identical n terminal domains ntds  but are truncated at residues corresponding to gag codons      and   in their ca c terminal domains ctds  to characterize oligomeric forms of the rsv ca variants we examined d crystals of the capsid proteins assembled on lipid monolayers using electron microscopy and image analysis approaches the ca proteins were observed to organize in hexagonal p  arrangements where rings of membrane proximal ntd hexamers were spaced at    intervals differences between the oligomeric structures of the ca variants were most evident in membrane distal regions where apparent ctds interconnect hexamer rings in this region ca  connections were observed readily while ca  and ca  contacts were resolved poorly suggesting that in vivo processing of ca  to the shorter forms may permit virions to adopt a dissembly competent conformation in addition to crystalline arrays the ca  and ca  proteins formed small spherical particles with diameters of        the spheres appear to be arranged from hexamer or hexamer plus pentamer ring subunits that are related to the d crystal forms our results implicate rsv ca hexamer rings as basic elements in the assembly of rsv virus cores
