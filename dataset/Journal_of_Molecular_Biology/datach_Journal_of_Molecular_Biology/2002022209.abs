determinants in nuclease specificity of ape and ape  human homologues of escherichia coli exonuclease iii edited by j miller
abasic sites and non conventional   ends e g    oxidized fragments including   phosphate groups and   mismatched nucleotides arise at significant frequency in the genome due to spontaneous decay oxidation or replication errors to avert the potentially mutagenic or cytotoxic effects of these chromosome modifications intermediates organisms are equipped with apurinic apyrimidinic ap endonucleases and   nucleases that initiate repair ape  which shares homology with escherichia coli exonuclease iii exoiii  is the major abasic endonuclease in mammals and an important yet selective contributor to   end processing mammals also possess a second protein ape  with sequence homology to exoiii but this protein exhibits comparatively weak ap site specific and   nuclease activities prompted by homology modeling studies we found that substitutions in the hydrophobic pocket of ape  comprised of f   w  and l   reduce abasic incision potency about fourfold to     fold while introduction of an exoiii like pocket into ape enhances its ap endonuclease function we demonstrate that mutations at f  and w  of ape increase   to   dna exonuclease activity these results coupled with prior comparative sequence analysis indicate that this active site hydrophobic pocket influences the substrate specificity of a diverse set of sequence related proteins possessing the conserved four layered    fold lastly we report that wild type ape excises   mismatched nucleotides at a rate up to   fold higher than correctly base paired nucleotides depending greatly on the structure and sequence of the dna substrate suggesting a novel selective role for the human protein in   mismatch repair
