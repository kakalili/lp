mapping of binding sites for nidogens fibulin  fibronectin and heparin to different ig modules of perlecan edited by m f moody
perlecan a major basement membrane proteoglycan has a complex modular structure designed for the binding of many cellular and extracellular ligands its domain iv which consists of a tandem of immunoglobulin like modules ig ig   is rich in such binding sites which have been mapped to different modules obtained by recombinant production heparin sulfatide binding was restricted to ig and shown to depend on four arginine residues that are close in space in  strands b and e of the c type ig fold the nidogen  and nidogen  isoforms bind to ig with high affinity kd   nm  this interaction depends on the globular nidogen domain g and is crucial for the formation of ternary complexes with laminins two loops of ig located between  strands b c and f g which are spatially close make a major contribution to binding fibronectin binding was localized to ig  and fibulin  binds to ig and ig   with different affinities this implicates a complex cluster of heterotypic interaction sites apparently important for the supramolecular organization of perlecan in tissues
