gadd   forms a homodimeric complex that binds tightly to mkk
gadd     and  proteins also known as growth arrest and dna damage inducible factors have a number of cellular functions including cell cycle regulation and propagation of signals produced by a variety of cellular stimuli maintaining genomic stability and apoptosis furthermore gadd   has been indicated as a major player in the endogenous nf  b mediated resistance to apoptosis in a variety of cell lines in fibroblasts this mechanism involves the inactivation of mkk  the upstream activator of jnk by direct binding within the kinase atp pocket on the basis of a number of experimental data the structures of gadd   and the gadd   mkk complex have been predicted recently and data show that interactions are mediated by acidic loops  and  and helices  and  of gadd   here we provide further evidence that gadd   is a prevailingly  helical protein and that in solution it is able to form non covalent dimers but not higher order oligomers in contrast to what has been reported for the homologous gadd   we show that the contact region between the two monomers is comprised of the predicted helix  residues q   q  and helix  residues k   r   of the protein which appear to be antiparallel and to form a large dimerisation surface not involved in mkk recognition the results suggest the occurrence of a large complex containing at least an mkk gadd   gadd   mkk tetrameric unit whose complexity could be further increased by the dimeric nature of the isolated mkk
