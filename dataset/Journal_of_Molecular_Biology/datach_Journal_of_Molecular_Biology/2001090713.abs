the   hs core element of the human  globin locus control region is required for high level globin gene expression in definitive but not in primitive erythropoiesis edited by m yaniv
to assess the contribution of dnase i hypersensitive site  hs  of the  globin locus control region lcr to overall lcr function we deleted a   bp fragment encompassing the core element of   hs from a   kb  globin locus yeast artificial chromosome   yac and analyzed globin gene expression during development in  yac transgenic mice four transgenic lines were established each contained at least one intact copy of the  globin locus the deletion of the   hs core element had no effect on globin gene expression during embryonic erythropoiesis in contrast deletion of the   hs core resulted in a significant decrease of  and  globin gene expression during definitive erythropoiesis in the fetal liver and a decrease of  globin gene expression in adult blood we conclude that the core element of   hs is required for globin gene expression only in definitive erythropoiesis absence of the core element of hs may limit the ability of the lcr to provide an open chromatin domain and or enhance  and  globin gene expression in the adult erythroid cells
