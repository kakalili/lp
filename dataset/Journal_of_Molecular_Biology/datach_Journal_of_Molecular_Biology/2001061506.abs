the crystal structure of     enoyl coa isomerase edited by i wilson
the active site geometry of the first crystal structure of a     enoyl coenzyme a coa isomerase the peroxisomal enzyme from the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae shows that only one catalytic base glu   is involved in shuttling the proton from the c carbon atom of the substrate   enoyl coa to the c atom of the product   enoyl coa site directed mutagenesis has been performed to confirm that this glutamate residue is essential for catalysis this     enoyl coa isomerase is a hexameric enzyme consisting of six identical subunits it belongs to the hydratase isomerase superfamily of enzymes which catalyze a wide range of coa dependent reactions the members of the hydratase isomerase superfamily have only a low level of sequence identity comparison of the crystal structure of the     enoyl coa isomerase with the other structures of this superfamily shows only one region of large structural variability which is in the second turn of the spiral fold and which is involved in defining the shape of the binding pocket
