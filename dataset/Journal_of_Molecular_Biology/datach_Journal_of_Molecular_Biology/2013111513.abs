crystal structure of the yeast ribosomal protein rps in complex with its chaperone yar
eukaryotic ribosome assembly involves a plethora of factors which ensure that a correctly folded ribosome contains all ribosomal protein components among these assembly factors yar has recently emerged as a molecular chaperone for ribosomal protein rps of the small ribosomal subunit  s in yeast in complex with its chaperone rps is imported into the nucleus and protected from aggregation how rps and other ribosomal proteins are initially sequestered and subsequently integrated into pre ribosomal particles is currently poorly understood here we present the crystal structure of yeast rps in complex with its chaperone yar at    resolution the crystal structure rationalizes how yar can protect rps from aggregation while facilitating nuclear import and suggests a mechanism for a stepwise exchange of molecular partners that ribosomal proteins interact with during ribosome assembly
