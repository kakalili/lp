time resolved absorption and uv resonance raman spectra reveal stepwise formation of t quaternary contacts in the allosteric pathway of hemoglobin
hemoglobin undergoes a series of molecular changes on the nanosecond and microsecond time scale following photodissociation of co ligands we have monitored these processes with a combination of transient absorption and resonance raman rr spectroscopy the latter have been acquired at higher data rates than previously available thanks to kilohertz ti sapphire laser technology with frequency quadrupling into the ultraviolet as a result of improved resolution of the uvrr time course a new intermediate has been identified in the pathway from the r hbco to the t deoxyhb state this intermediate is not detected via absorption transients since the change in heme absorption is insignificant but its lifetime agrees with a reported magnetic circular dichroism transient which has been attributed to a quaternary tryptophan interaction the new uvrr data allow elaboration of the allosteric pathway by establishing that the t state quaternary contacts are formed in two well separated steps with time constants of    s and   s instead of a single   s process the first step involves the  hinge  region contacts as monitored by the trp    asp   h bond while the second involves the  switch  region as monitored by the tyr    asp   h bond a working model for the allosteric pathway is presented
