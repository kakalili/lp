elimination of a cis proline containing loop and turn optimization stabilizes a protein and accelerates its folding
in the n domain of the gene  protein of phage fd two consecutive  strands are connected by a mobile loop of seven residues       the stability of this loop is low and the asp  pro  bond at its tip shows conformational heterogeneity with   being in the cis and   in the trans form the refolding kinetics of n are complex because the molecules with cis or trans isomers at pro  both fold to native like conformations albeit with different rates we employed consensus design to shorten the seven residue irregular loop around pro  to a four residue type i  turn without a proline this increased the conformational stability of n by almost   kj mol   and abolished the complexity of the folding kinetics turn sequences obtained from in vitro selections for increased stability strongly resembled those derived from the consensus design two other type i  turns of n could also be stabilized by consensus design for all three turns the gain in stability originates from an increase in the rate of refolding the turns form native like structures early during refolding and thus stabilize the folding transition state the crystal structure of the variant with all three stabilized turns confirms that the      loop was in fact shortened to a type i  turn and that the other turns maintained their type i  conformation after sequence optimization
