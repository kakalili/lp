crystal structure of a new type of nadph dependent quinone oxidoreductase qor  from escherichia coli
escherichia coli qor  nad p h dependent quinone oxidoreductase a ytfg gene product  which catalyzes two electron reduction of methyl   benzoquinone is a new type of quinone reducing enzyme with distinct primary sequence and oligomeric conformation from previously known quinone oxidoreductases the crystal structures of native qor and the qor  nadph nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reduced form complex reveal that qor consists of two domains n domain and c domain resembling those of nmra a negative transcriptional regulator that belongs to the short chain dehydrogenase reductase family the n domain which adopts the rossmann fold provides a platform for nadph binding whereas the c domain which contains a hydrophobic pocket connected to the nadph binding site appears to play important roles in substrate binding asn  near the nadph binding site has been identified to be involved in substrate binding and catalysis from structural and mutational analyses moreover compared with wild type strain the qor overexpressing strain shows growth retardation and remarkable decrease in several enzymes involved in carbon metabolism suggesting that qor could play some physiological roles in addition to quinone reduction
