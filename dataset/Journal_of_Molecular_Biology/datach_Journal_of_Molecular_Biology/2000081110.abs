crystal structure of a phage library derived single chain fv fragment complexed with turkey egg white lysozyme at    resolution edited by i a wilson
the three dimensional structure of the single chain fv fragment f in complex with turkey egg white lysozyme tel has been determined to a nominal resolution of    by x ray diffraction the scfv fragment f was derived from phage display libraries in two steps and binds both hen and turkey egg white lysozyme although the level of binding affinity is two orders of magnitude greater for the turkey lysozyme the comparison of the crystal structure with a model of the single chain fv fragment f in complex with hen egg white lysozyme hel reveals that in the latter a clash between asp  in lysozyme and trp  of the complementarity determining region h of the heavy chain variable domain occurs this is the only explanation apparent from the crystal structure for the better binding of tel compared to hel the binding site topology on the paratope is not simply a planar surface as is usually found in antibody protein interfaces but includes a cleft between the light chain variable domain and heavy chain variable domain large enough to accommodate a loop from the lysozyme the scfv fragment f recognizes an epitope on tel that differs from the three antigenic determinants recognized in other known crystal structures of monoclonal antibodies in complex with lysozyme
