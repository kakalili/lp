single vs ribozyme molecules reveal dynamic and hierarchical folding toward catalysis
non coding rnas of complex tertiary structure are involved in numerous aspects of the replication and processing of genetic information in many organisms however an understanding of the complex relationship between their structural dynamics and function is only slowly emerging the neurospora varkud satellite vs ribozyme provides a model system to address this relationship first it adopts a tertiary structure assembled from common elements a kissing loop and two three way junctions second catalytic activity of the ribozyme is essential for replication of vs rna in vivo and can be readily assayed in vitro here we exploit single molecule fret to show that the vs ribozyme exhibits previously unobserved dynamic and heterogeneous hierarchical folding into an active structure readily reversible kissing loop formation combined with slow cleavage of the upstream substrate helix suggests a model whereby the structural dynamics of the vs ribozyme favor cleavage of the substrate downstream of the ribozyme core instead this preference is expected to facilitate processing of the multimeric rna replication intermediate into circular vs rna which is the predominant form observed in vivo
