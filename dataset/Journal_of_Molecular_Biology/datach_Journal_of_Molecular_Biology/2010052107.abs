using soft x rays for a detailed picture of divalent metal binding in the nucleosome
divalent metals associate with dna in a site selective manner which can influence nucleosome positioning mobility compaction and recognition by nuclear factors we previously characterized divalent metal binding in the nucleosome core using hard short wavelength x rays allowing high resolution crystallographic determination of the strongest affinity sites which revealed that mn  associates with the dna major groove in a sequence and conformation dependent manner in this study we obtained diffraction data with soft x rays at the mn  absorption edge for a core particle crystal in the presence of   mm mnso  mimicking prevailing mg  concentration in the nucleus this provides an exceptional view of counterion binding in the nucleosome through identification of  divalent metal binding sites in addition to that at the well characterized major interparticle interface only one other histone  divalent metal binding site is found which corresponds to a symmetry related counterpart on the  free  h b   helix c terminus this emphasizes the importance of the  helix dipole in ion binding and suggests that the h b motif may serve as a nucleation site in nucleosome compaction the  sites associated with the dna are characterized by   high affinity direct coordination at the most electrostatically favorable major groove locations   metal hydrate binding to the major groove   direct coordination to phosphate groups at sites of high charge density   metal hydrate binding in the minor groove or   metal hydrate  divalent anion pairing metal hydrates are found within the minor groove only at locations displaying a narrow range of high intermediate width and to which histone n terminal tails are not associated or proximal this indicates that divalent metals and histone tails can both collaborate and compete in minor groove association which sheds light on nucleosome solubility and chromatin compaction behavior
