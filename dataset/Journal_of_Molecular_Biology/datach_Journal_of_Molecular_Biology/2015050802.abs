ribosomal initiation complex driven changes in the stability and dynamics of initiation factor  regulate the fidelity of translation initiation
joining of the large  s ribosomal subunit to the small  s ribosomal subunit initiation complex ic during bacterial translation initiation is catalyzed by the initiation factor if if  because the rate of subunit joining is coupled to the if transfer rna trna  and mrna codon compositions of the  s ic the subunit joining reaction functions as a kinetic checkpoint that regulates the fidelity of translation initiation recent structural studies suggest that the conformational dynamics of the if  trna sub complex forming on the intersubunit surface of the  s ic may play a significant role in the mechanisms that couple the rate of subunit joining to the if trna and codon compositions of the  s ic to test this hypothesis we have developed a single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer signal between if and trna that has enabled us to monitor the conformational dynamics of the if  trna sub complex across a series of  s ics our results demonstrate that  s ics undergoing rapid subunit joining display a high affinity for if and an if  trna sub complex that primarily samples a single conformation in contrast  s ics that undergo slower subunit joining exhibit a decreased affinity for if and or a change in the conformational dynamics of the if  trna sub complex these results strongly suggest that  s ic driven changes in the stability of if and the conformational dynamics of the if  trna sub complex regulate the efficiency and fidelity of subunit joining during translation initiation
