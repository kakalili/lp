the h a  h b dimeric kinetic intermediate is stabilized by widespread hydrophobic burial with few fully native interactions
the h a  h b histone heterodimer folds via monomeric and dimeric kinetic intermediates within    ms the h a and h b polypeptides associate in a nearly diffusion limited reaction to form a dimeric ensemble denoted i and i   the latter being a subpopulation characterized by a higher content of nonnative structure nns  the i ensemble folds to the native heterodimer n  through an observable first order kinetic phase to determine the regions of structure in the i ensemble we characterized  ala mutants of buried hydrophobic residues spanning the three helices of the canonical histone folds of h a and h b and the h b c terminal helix all but one targeted residue contributed significantly to the stability of i  the transition state and n  however only residues in the hydrophobic core of the dimer interface perturbed the i   population destabilization of i   correlated with slower folding rates implying that nns is not a kinetic trap but rather accelerates folding the pattern of  values indicated that residues forming intramolecular interactions in the peripheral helices contributed similar stability to i and n  but residues involved in intermolecular interactions in the hydrophobic core are only partially folded in i  these findings suggest a dimerize then rearrange model residues throughout the histone fold contribute to the stability of i  but after the rapid dimerization reaction the hydrophobic core of the dimer interface has few fully native interactions in the transition state leading to n  more native like interactions are developed and nonnative interactions are rearranged
