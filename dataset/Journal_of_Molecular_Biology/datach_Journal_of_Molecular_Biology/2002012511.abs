electron donation between copper containing nitrite reductases and cupredoxins the nature of protein protein interaction in complex formation edited by r huber
in denitrifying organisms with copper containing dissimilatory nitrite reductases electron donation from a reduced cupredoxin is an essential step in the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide copper nitrite reductases are categorised into two subgroups based on their colour green and blue which are found in organisms where the cupredoxins are pseudoazurins and azurins respectively in view of this and some in vitro electron donation experiments it has been suggested that copper nitrite reductases have specific electron donors and that electron transfer takes place in a specific complex of the two proteins we report results from the first comprehensive electron donation experiments using three copper nitrite reductases one green and two blue and five cupredoxins one pseudoazurin and four azurins our data show that pseudoazurin can readily donate electrons to both blue and green copper nitrite reductases in contrast all of the azurins react very sluggishly as electron donors to the green nitrite reductase these results are discussed in terms of surface compatibility of the component proteins complex formation overall charges charge distribution hydrophobic patches and redox potentials a docking model for the complexes is proposed
