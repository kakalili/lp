folding of s structures with divergent amino acid composition pathway flexibility within partly overlapping foldons
studies of circular permutants have demonstrated that the folding reaction of s from thermus thermophilus s t is malleable and responds in an ordered manner to changes of the sequence separation between interacting residues the s t permutants retain a common nucleation pattern in the form of a two strand helix motif that can be recruited from different parts of the structure to further test the robustness of the two strand helix nucleus we have here determined the crystal structure and folding reaction of an evolutionary divergent s protein from the hyperthermophilic bacterium aquifex aeolicus s a  although the overall topology of s a is very similar to that of s t the architecture of the hydrophobic core is radically different by containing a large proportion of stacked phe side chains despite this disparate core composition the folding rate constant and the kinetic m values of s a are identical to those of s t the folding nucleus of s a is also found to retain the characteristic two strand helix motif of the s t permutants but with a new structural emphasis the results suggest that the protein folding reaction is linked to topology only in the sense that the native state topology determines the repertoire of accessible nucleation motifs if the native structure allows several equivalent ways of recruiting a productive nucleus the folding reaction is free to redistribute within these topological constraints
