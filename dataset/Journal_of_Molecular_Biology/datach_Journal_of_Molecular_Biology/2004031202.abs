exploring the regulation of trna distribution on the genomic scale
though up to   of the total rna in bacterial cells is trna the regulation of trna distribution on the genomic level remains unclear trna distribution is governed by four processes transcription processing of precursor trna degradation of precursor trna and degradation of mature trna to elucidate the relationship between these processes in the regulation of trna production the relative trna distribution was measured using a microarray specifically designed for trna we developed a procedure that selectively labels   cca containing rnas with the fluorophores cy or cy  the labeled trnas were then hybridized to microarrays printed with complementary dna probes the regulation of trna distribution in bacillus subtilis was explored for a wild type strain and a mutant strain with significantly decreased levels of rnase p the enzyme required for the   maturation of all trna the strains were either grown under a variety of conditions at doubling times ranging from   to   doublings per hour to investigate growth related changes in the trna abundance or treated with the transcriptional inhibitor rifampicin to analyze mature trna degradation our results confirm that transcription and processing contribute significantly to the distribution of the  trna species in b subtilis and suggest a role for the degradation of precursor trna mature trna degradation occurs with little specificity for individual trna species and on the hour time scale indicating that degradation of mature trna plays only a minor role in the regulation of trna distribution aside from transcription the final trna distribution appears to be derived from a balance between processing and precursor degradation activities
