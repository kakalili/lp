molecular docking for substrate identification the short chain dehydrogenases reductases
protein ligand docking has recently been investigated as a tool for protein function identification with some success in identifying both known and unknown substrates of proteins however identifying a protein s substrate when cross docking a large number of enzymes and their cognate ligands remains a challenge to explore a more limited yet practically important and timely problem in more detail we have used docking for identifying the substrates of a single protein family with remarkable substrate diversity the short chain dehydrogenases reductases we examine different protocols for identifying candidate substrates for  short chain dehydrogenase reductase proteins of known catalytic function we present the results of docking gt   metabolites from the human metabolome to each of these proteins together with their known cognate substrates and products and we investigate the ability of docking to a reproduce a viable binding mode for the substrate and b to rank the substrate highly amongst the dataset of other metabolites in addition we examine whether our docking results provide information about the nature of the substrate based on the best scoring metabolites in the dataset we compare two different docking methods and two alternative scoring functions for one of the docking methods and we attempt to rationalise both successes and failures finally we introduce a new protocol whereby we dock only a set of representative structures medoids to each of the proteins in the hope of characterising each binding site in terms of its ligand preferences with a reduced computational cost we compare the results from this protocol with our original docking experiments and we find that although the rank of the representatives correlates well with the mean rank of the clusters to which they belong a simple structure based clustering is too na ve for the purpose of substrate identification many clusters comprise ligands with widely varying affinities for the same protein hence important candidates can be missed if a single representative is used
