the structure and stability of the monomorphic hla g are influenced by the nature of the bound peptide
the highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex class ia mhc ia molecules present a broad array of peptides to the clonotypically diverse   t cell receptors in contrast mhc ib molecules exhibit limited polymorphism and bind a more restricted peptide repertoire in keeping with their major role in innate immunity nevertheless some mhc ib molecules do play a role in adaptive immunity while human leukocyte antigen e hla e  the mhc ib molecule binds a very restricted repertoire of peptides the peptide binding preferences of hla g the class ib molecule are less stringent although the basis by which hla g can bind various peptides is unclear to investigate how hla g can accommodate different peptides we compared the structure of hla g bound to three naturally abundant self peptides riiprhlql kgppaaltl and klpqafyil and their thermal stabilities the conformation of hla gkgppaaltl was very similar to that of the hla griiprhlql structure however the structure of hla gklpqafyil not only differed in the conformation of the bound peptide but also caused a small shift in the   helix of hla g furthermore the relative stability of hla g was observed to be dependent on the nature of the bound peptide these peptide dependent effects on the substructure of the monomorphic hla g are likely to impact on its recognition by receptors of both innate and adaptive immune systems
