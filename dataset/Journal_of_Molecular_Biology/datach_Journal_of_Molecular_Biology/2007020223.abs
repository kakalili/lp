a reca mutant reca   suppresses the recombination deficiency of the recbc  d    interaction in vitro and in vivo
in escherichia coli homologous recombination initiated at double stranded dna breaks requires the recbcd enzyme a multifunctional heterotrimeric complex that possesses processive helicase and exonuclease activities upon encountering the dna regulatory sequence   the enzymatic properties of recbcd enzyme are altered its helicase activity is reduced the      nuclease activity is attenuated the       nuclease activity is up regulated and it manifests an ability to load reca protein onto single stranded dna the net result of these changes is the production of a highly recombinogenic structure known as the presynaptic filament previously we found that the recc   mutation alters  recognition so that this mutant enzyme recognizes an altered  sequence    which comprises seven of the original nucleotides in   plus four novel nucleotides although some consequences of this mutant enzyme  mutant  interaction could be detected in vivo and in vitro stimulation of recombination in vivo could not to resolve this seemingly contradictory observation we examined the behavior of a reca mutant reca   that displays enhanced biochemical activity in vitro and possesses suppressor function in vivo we show that the recombination deficiency of the recbc  d    interaction can be overcome by the enhanced ability of reca  to assemble on single stranded dna in vitro and in vivo these data are consistent with findings showing that the loading of reca protein by recbcd is necessary in vivo and they show that reca proteins with enhanced single stranded dna binding capacity can partially bypass the need for recbcd mediated loading
