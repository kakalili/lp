Protein folding experiments demonstrate that the folding behaviors of many proteins can be roughly classified into two types: two-state kinetics and multi-state kinetics. Although the two types of protein folding kinetics have been observed for a long time, what determines the folding type of a protein is still largely unclear. The present work performed a comparative study based on a dataset of 43 two-state and 42 multi-state folders at different levels of proteins' intrinsic properties from the simplest sequence length to native structure topology. The results show that protein's amino acids composition and the long-range interaction-based topological complexity rather than secondary structure contents are the major determinants of protein folding type. Furthermore, a sequence-based folding type prediction achieved an accuracy of more than 80%. These findings implicate that there is no clear boundary between secondary and tertiary structure formation during the protein folding process and support the existence of a continuum of folding mechanism between the two ends of hierarchic and nucleation folding scenarios.
