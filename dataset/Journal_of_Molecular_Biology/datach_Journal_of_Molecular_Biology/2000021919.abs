high copy display of large proteins on phage for functional selections edited by p e wright
we have isolated mutations in the major coat protein p of m  phage that greatly increase the surface display of monomeric or oligomeric proteins the monomeric protein human growth hormone hgh  was fused to the n terminus of p  libraries of p variants were constructed and variants that increased hgh display were selected by binding to the extracellular domain of the hgh receptor the hgh p fusion protein was found to be extremely tolerant of mutations and a number of p variants were found that increased display to levels that improved detection of the hgh p fusion by almost   fold the increased display likely results from better accommodation of the hgh p fusion protein in the phage coat using this high copy display format it was possible for the first time to detect variants of hgh with very weak affinities for the hghbp kd gt   m  the display of a tetrameric protein streptavidin    kda  was also increased suggesting the approach may be general to many proteins the initial product of a natural or invented selection from a naive library is often a weakly functioning protein these improvements in high copy display should facilitate the broader goal for selection of proteins with novel functions
