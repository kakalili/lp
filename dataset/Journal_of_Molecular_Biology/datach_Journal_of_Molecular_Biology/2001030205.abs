guiding ribozyme cleavage through motif recognition the mechanism of cleavage site selection by a group ii intron ribozyme edited by j doudna
the mechanism by which group ii introns cleave the correct phosphodiester linkage was investigated by studying the reaction of mutant substrates with a ribozyme derived from intron ai   while fidelity was found to be quite high in most cases a single mutation on the substrate  c resulted in a dramatic loss of fidelity when this mutation was combined with a second mutation that induces a bulge in the exon binding site  intron binding site  ebs ibs  duplex the base pairing register of the ebs ibs duplex was shifted and the cleavage site moved to a downstream position on the substrate conversely when mismatches were incorporated at the ebs ibs terminus the duplex was effectively truncated and cleavage occurred at an upstream site taken together these data demonstrate that the cleavage site of a group ii intron ribozyme can be tuned at will by manipulating the thermodynamic stability and structure of the ebs ibs pairing the results are consistent with a model in which the cleavage site is not designated through recognition of specific nucleotides such as the   terminal residue of ebs  instead the ribozyme detects a structure at the junction between single and double stranded residues on the bound substrate this finding explains the puzzling lack of phylogenetic conservation in ribozyme and substrate sequences near group ii intron target sites
