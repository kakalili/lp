dynalign an algorithm for finding the secondary structure common to two rna sequences edited by i tinoco
with the rapid increase in the size of the genome sequence database computational analysis of rna will become increasingly important in revealing structure function relationships and potential drug targets rna secondary structure prediction for a single sequence is   accurate on average for a large database of known secondary structures this level of accuracy provides a good starting point for determining a secondary structure either by comparative sequence analysis or by the interpretation of experimental studies dynalign is a new computer algorithm that improves the accuracy of structure prediction by combining free energy minimization and comparative sequence analysis to find a low free energy structure common to two sequences without requiring any sequence identity it uses a dynamic programming construct suggested by sankoff dynalign however restricts the maximum distance m allowed between aligned nucleotides in the two sequences this makes the calculation tractable because the complexity is simplified to o m n  where n is the length of the shorter sequence the accuracy of dynalign was tested with sets of  trnas seven  s rrnas and two r    utr sequences on average dynalign predicted    of known base pairs in the trnas as compared to    for free energy minimization alone for the  s rrnas the average accuracy improves from    to     the secondary structure of the r    utr from drosophila takahashii is poorly predicted by standard free energy minimization with dynalign however the structure predicted in tandem with the sequence from drosophila melanogaster nearly matches the structure determined by comparative sequence analysis
