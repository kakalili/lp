interaction of the maguk family member acvrinp and the cytoplasmic domain of the notch ligand delta
the evolutionarily conserved notch signal transduction pathway regulates cell fate and cellular differentiation in various tissues and has essential functions in embryonic patterning and tumorigenesis cell  cell signaling by the notch pathway is mediated by the interaction of the transmembrane receptor notch with its ligands delta or jagged presented on adjacent cells whereas signal transduction to notch expressing cells has been described it is unclear whether delta dependent signaling may exist within the delta expressing cell here we report on the identification of acvrinp  a maguk family member interacting with the intracellular domain of delta  dll  we confirmed the interaction between dll and acvrinp by pull down experiments in vitro and in a mammalian two hybrid system in vivo we delimited the fourth pdz domain of acvrinp and the pdz binding domain of dll as major interacting domains in situ expression analyses in mouse embryos revealed that dll and acvrinp show partly overlapping but distinct expression patterns for example in the central nervous system and the vibrissae buds further we found that expression of acvrinp is altered in dll loss of function mouse embryos
