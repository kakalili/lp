refinement of protein structures into low resolution density maps using rosetta
we describe a method based on rosetta structure refinement for generating high resolution all atom protein models from electron cryomicroscopy density maps a local measure of the fit of a model to the density is used to directly guide structure refinement and to identify regions incompatible with the density that are then targeted for extensive rebuilding over a range of test cases using both simulated and experimentally generated data the method consistently increases the accuracy of starting models generated either by comparative modeling or by hand tracing the density the method can achieve near atomic resolution starting from density maps at      resolution
