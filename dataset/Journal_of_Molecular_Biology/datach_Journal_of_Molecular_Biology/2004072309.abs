resolution structure of a cytoplasmic dynein motor reveals a seven member planar ring
dyneins form one of the three major families of cytoskeleton based motor proteins that together drive most of the visible forms of cell and organelle movement we present here a d reconstruction of a cytoplasmic dynein motor domain obtained by electron microscopy at   resolution this work demonstrates a basic motor architecture of a flat slightly elliptical ring composed of seven densities arranged around a partially enclosed central cavity we have used specific fab tags to localize the microtubule binding domain the connecting stalk emerges at one end of the motor s long axis through proposed fitting of representative aaa domain structures we show that the nucleotide catalytic p  domain is likely located at the opposite end of the motor thus mechanisms that couple nucleotide hydrolysis with microtubule binding must be propagated around a ring structure in a manner clearly distinct from kinesin or myosin mediated movements analysis of the fab tagged datasets reveals classes of particles with stalks protruding at distinct angles from the motor there is a     variation in microtubule binding stalk angle that may reflect linkage to dynein s mechanochemical cycle overall the work provides sufficient resolution to begin the mapping of landmark features onto a dynein motor and provides a foundation for understanding the mechanics of dynein movement
