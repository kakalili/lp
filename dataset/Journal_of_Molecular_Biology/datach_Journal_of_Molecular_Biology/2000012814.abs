relationships between protein structure and dynamics from a database of nmr derived backbone order parameters edited by p e wright
the amplitude of protein backbone nh group motions on a time scale faster than molecular tumbling may be determined by analysis of  n nmr relaxation data according to the lipari szabo model free formalism an internet accessible database has been compiled containing   order parameters from  independent nmr relaxation studies on proteins whose three dimensional structures are known a series of statistical analyses has been performed to identify relationships between the structural features and backbone dynamics of these proteins comparison of average order parameters for different amino acid types indicates that amino acids with small side chains tend to have greater backbone flexibility than those with large side chains in addition the motions of a given nh group are also related to the sizes of the neighboring amino acids in the primary sequence the secondary structural environment appears to influence backbone dynamics relatively weakly with only subtle differences between the order parameter distributions of loop structures and regular hydrogen bonded secondary structure elements however nh groups near helix termini are more mobile on average than those in the central regions of helices tertiary structure influences are also relatively weak but in the expected direction with more exposed residues being more flexible on average than residues that are relatively inaccessible to solvent
