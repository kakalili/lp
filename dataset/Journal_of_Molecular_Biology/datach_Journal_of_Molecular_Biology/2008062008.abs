merging the binding sites of aldose and aldehyde reductase for detection of inhibitor selectivity determining features
inhibition of human aldose reductase alr  evolved as a promising therapeutic concept to prevent late complications of diabetes as well as appropriate affinity and bioavailability putative inhibitors should possess a high level of selectivity for alr over the related aldehyde reductase alr  we investigated the selectivity determining features by gradually mapping the residues deviating between the binding pockets of alr and alr into the alr binding pocket the resulting mutational constructs of alr  eight point mutations and one double mutant were probed for their influence towards ligand selectivity by x ray structure analysis of the corresponding complexes and isothermal titration calorimetry itc  the binding properties of these mutants were evaluated using a ligand set of zopolrestat a related uracil derivative idd   idd   sorbinil fidarestat and tolrestat our study revealed induced fit adaptations within the mutated binding site as an essential prerequisite for ligand accommodation related to the selectivity discrimination of the ligands however our study also highlights the limits of the present understanding of protein  ligand interactions interestingly binding site mutations not involved in any direct interaction to the ligands in various cases show significant effects towards their binding thermodynamics furthermore our results suggest the binding site residues deviating between alr and alr influence ligand affinity in a complex interplay presumably involving changes of dynamic properties and differences of the solvation desolvation balance upon ligand binding
