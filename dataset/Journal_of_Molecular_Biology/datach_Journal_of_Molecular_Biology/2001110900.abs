targeted gene transduction of mammalian cells expressing the her neu receptor by filamentous phage edited by j karn
screening a random peptide library displayed on phage as fusion to the major capsid protein pviii identified a ligand binding the human epidermal growth factor receptor  her  specifically by mutating the sequence of this ligand a  secondary  library was generated whose panning on her positive cells isolated a phage borne peptide with increased specific binding to her  phage nl   the same peptide recognised her specifically when expressed as an n terminal fusion to the minor coat protein piii phage nl  was engineered to include a mammalian expression cassette for a reporter gene within its genome this modified phage transduced her expressing cells with very high specificity more than   fold that of parental her negative cells and with an efficiency comparable to that of chemical transfection protocols the gene delivery process was remarkably fast requiring less than  minutes incubation of phage with target cells to generate detectable levels of gene expression
