animal protection and structural studies of a consensus sequence vaccine targeting the receptor binding domain of the type iv pilus of pseudomonas aeruginosa
one of the main obstacles in the development of a vaccine against pseudomonas aeruginosa is the requirement that it is protective against a wide range of virulent strains we have developed a synthetic peptide consensus sequence vaccine cs  that targets the host receptor binding domain rbd of the type iv pilus of p aeruginosa here we show that this vaccine provides increased protection against challenge by the four piliated strains that we have examined pak pao kb and p  in the a by snj mouse model of acute p aeruginosa infection to further characterize the consensus sequence we engineered cs into the pak monomeric pilin protein and determined the crystal structure of the chimeric cs pilin to     resolution the substitutions t  k and e  p used to create cs do not disrupt the conserved backbone conformation of the pilin rbd in fact based on the cs pilin structure we hypothesize that the e  p substitution bolsters the conserved backbone conformation and may partially explain the immunological activity of cs  structural analysis of cs  pak and k   pilins reveal substitutions of non conserved residues in the rbd are compensated for by complementary changes in the rest of the pilin monomer thus the interactions between the rbd and the rest of the pilin can either be mediated by polar interactions of a hydrogen bond network in some strains or by hydrophobic interactions in others both configurations maintain a conserved backbone conformation of the rbd thus the backbone conformation is critical in our consensus sequence vaccine design and that cross reactivity of the antibody response may be modulated by the composition of exposed side chains on the surface of the rbd this structure will guide our future vaccine design by focusing our investigation on the four variable residue positions that are exposed on the rbd surface
