hydration and packing are crucial to amyloidogenesis as revealed by pressure studies on transthyretin variants that either protect or worsen amyloid disease
the formation of amyloid aggregates is the hallmark of the amyloidogenic diseases transthyretin ttr is involved in senile systemic amyloidosis wild type protein and familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy point mutants  through the use of high hydrostatic pressure hhp  we compare the stability among wild type wt ttr two disease associated mutations v m and l p and a trans suppressor mutation t  m  our data show that the amyloidogenic conformation easily populated in the disease associated mutant l p can be induced by a cycle of compression  decompression with the wt protein rendering the latter highly amyloidogenic after decompression the recovered wt structure has weaker subunit interactions loosened tetramer t   and presents a stability similar to l p suggesting that hhp induces a defective fold in the wt protein converting it to an altered conformation already present in the aggressive mutant l p on the other hand glucose a chemical chaperone can mimic the trans suppression mutation by stabilizing the native state and by decreasing the amyloidogenic potential of the wt ttr at ph   the sequence of pressure stability observed was l p lt v m lt wt  t  m the pressure dissociation of l p at  c exhibited dependence on protein concentration allowing us to assess the volume change of association and the free energy change after a cycle of compression  decompression at   c and ph   or lower all amyloidogenic variants underwent aggregation binding of bis  anilinonaphthalene  sulfonate  bis ans revealed that the species formed under pressure retained part of its tertiary contacts except t  m  however at neutral ph where aggregation did not take place after decompression bis ans binding was absent thus ttr has to experience this partially folded conformation to undergo aggregation after decompression overall our studies provide evidence that amyloidogenesis correlates with less packed structures larger volume changes and high susceptibility to water infiltration the hydration effects can be counteracted by osmolytes or by a specific mutation
