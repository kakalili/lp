viral rnai suppressor reversibly binds sirna to outcompete dicer and risc via multiple turnover
rna interference is a conserved gene regulatory mechanism employed by most eukaryotes as a key component of their innate immune response to viruses and retrotransposons during viral infection the rnase iii type endonuclease dicer cleaves viral double stranded rna into small interfering rnas sirnas     nucleotides in length and helps load them into the rna induced silencing complex risc to guide the cleavage of complementary viral rna as a countermeasure many viruses have evolved viral rna silencing suppressors rss that tightly and presumably quantitatively bind sirnas to thwart rna interference mediated degradation viral rss proteins also act across kingdoms as potential immunosuppressors in gene therapeutic applications here we report fluorescence quenching and electrophoretic mobility shift assays that probe sirna binding by the dimeric rss p  from carnation italian ringspot virus as well as by human dicer and risc assembly complexes we find that the sirna p  interaction is readily reversible characterized by rapid binding           m   s   and marked dissociation koff        s    we also observe that p  efficiently competes with recombinant dicer and inhibits the formation of risc related assembly complexes found in human cell extract computational modeling based on these results provides evidence for the transient formation of a ternary complex between sirna human dicer and p  an expanded model of rna silencing indicates that multiple turnover by reversible binding of sirnas potentiates the efficiency of the suppressor protein our predictive model is expected to be applicable to the dosing of p  as a silencing suppressor in viral gene therapy
