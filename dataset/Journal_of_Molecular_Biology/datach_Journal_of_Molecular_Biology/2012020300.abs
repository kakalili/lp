cecr is involved in spermatogenesis and forms a complex with snf h in the testis
the regulation of nucleosome positioning and composition by atp dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes and their associated binding partners plays important biological roles in mammals cecr is a binding partner to the iswi imitation switch atpase snf l smarca and is involved in neural tube closure and inner ear development however its functions in adult tissues have not been examined here we report that cecr contributes to spermatogenesis and forms a complex that includes the other iswi atpase snf h smarca in the testis cecr mutant males non penetrant for neural tube defects sired smaller litters than wild type males strikingly while we found that cecr mutants have normal seminiferous epithelium morphology sperm count motility and morphology the mutant spermatozoa were compromised in their ability to fertilize oocytes investigation of cecr iswi complexes in the testis showed that snf h interacted with cecr  and this interaction was also observed in embryonic stem cells suggesting that cecr may interact with snf h or snf l depending on the cell type finally we found that cecr mutants exhibit misregulation of the homeobox transcription factor dlx in the testis suggesting that cecr complexes may regulate gene expression during spermatogenesis taken together our results demonstrate a novel role of cecr containing complexes in spermatogenesis and show that cecr interacts predominantly with snf h instead of snf l in the testis
