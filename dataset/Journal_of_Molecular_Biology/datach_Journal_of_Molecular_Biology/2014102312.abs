dna recognition by a   transcriptional activator from aquifex aeolicus
transcription initiation by bacterial   polymerase requires the action of a transcriptional activator protein activators bind sequence specifically upstream of the transcription initiation site via a dna binding domain dbd  the structurally characterized dbds from activators all belong to the fis factor for inversion stimulation family of helix  turn  helix dna binding proteins we report here structures of the free and dna bound forms of the dbd of ntrc  dbd from aquifex aeolicus a member of the ntrc family of   activators two ntrc binding sites were identified upstream     and   bp from the start of the lpxc gene which is responsible for the first committed step in lipid a biosynthesis this is the first experimental evidence for   regulation in lpxc expression  dbd was crystallized both without dna and in complex with the    binding site the structures together with biochemical data indicate that ntrc binds to dna in a manner that is similar to that of its close homolog fis the greater sequence specificity for the binding of dbd relative to fis seems to arise from a larger number of base specific contacts contributing to affinity than for fis
