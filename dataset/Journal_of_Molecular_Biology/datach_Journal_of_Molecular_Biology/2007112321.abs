strand specific contacts and divalent metal ion regulate double strand break formation by the giy yig homing endonuclease i bmoi
giy yig homing endonucleases are modular enzymes consisting of a well defined n terminal catalytic domain connected to a variable c terminal dna binding domain previous studies have revealed that the role of the dna binding domain is to recognize and bind intronless dna substrate positioning the n terminal catalytic domain such that it is poised to generate a staggered double strand break by an unknown mechanism interactions of the n terminal catalytic domain with intronless substrate are therefore a critical step in the reaction pathway but have been difficult to define here we have taken advantage of the reduced activity of i bmoi an isoschizomer of the well studied bacteriophage t homing endonuclease i tevi to examine double strand break formation by i bmoi we present evidence demonstrating that i bmoi generates a double strand break by two sequential but chemically independent nicking reactions where divalent metal ion is a limiting factor in top strand nicking we also show by in gel footprinting that contacts by the i bmoi catalytic domain induce significant minor groove dna distortions that occur independently of bottom strand nicking bottom strand contacts are critical for accurate top strand nicking whereas top strand contacts have little influence on the accuracy of bottom strand nicking we discuss our results in the context of current models of giy yig endonuclease function with emphasis on the role of divalent metal ion and strand specific contacts in regulating the activity of a single active site to generate a staggered double strand break
