the rapid exchange of zinc  enables trace levels to profoundly influence amyloid  misfolding and dominates assembly outcomes in cu  zn  mixtures
the misfolding and self assembly of amyloid   a  into oligomers and fibres is fundamental to alzheimer s disease pathology alzheimer s disease is a multifaceted disease one factor that is thought to have a significant role in disease aetiology is zn  homeostasis which is disrupted in the brains of alzheimer s disease sufferers and has been shown to modulate alzheimer s symptoms in animal models here we investigate how the kinetics of a  fibre growth are affected at a range of zn  concentrations and we use transmission electron microscopy to characterise the aggregate assemblies formed we demonstrate that for a      and a      as little as   mol equivalent of zn    nm is sufficient to greatly perturb the formation of amyloid fibres irreversibly instead a      assembles into short rod like structures that pack tightly together into ordered stacks whereas a      forms short crooked assemblies that knit together to form a mesh of disordered tangles our data suggest that a small number of zn  ions are able to influence a great many a  molecules through the rapid exchange of zn  between a  peptides surprisingly although cu  binds to a     times tighter than zn  the effect of zn  on a  assembly dominates in cu  zn  mixtures suggesting that trace levels of zn  must have a profound effect on extracellular a  accumulation trace zn  levels profoundly influence a  assembly even at concentrations weaker than its affinity for a  these observations indicate that inhibitors of fibre assembly do not necessarily have to be at high concentration and affinity to have a profound impact
