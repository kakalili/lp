amyloid forming peptides from   microglobulin  insights into the mechanism of fibril formation in vitro
microglobulin   m is one of over  proteins known to be involved in human amyloid disease peptides equivalent to each of the seven  strands of the native protein together with an eighth peptide corresponding to the most stable region in the amyloid precursor conformation formed at ph   that includes residues in the native strand e plus the eight succeeding residues named peptide e    were synthesised and their ability to form fibrils investigated surprisingly only two sequences both of which encompass the region that forms strand e in native  m are capable of forming amyloid like fibrils in vitro these peptides correspond to residues     peptide e and     peptide e   of intact  m the peptides form fibrils under the acidic conditions shown previously to promote amyloid formation from the intact protein ph lt  at low and high ionic strength  and also associate to form fibrils at neutral ph fibrils formed from these two peptides enhance fibrillogenesis of the intact protein no correlation was found between secondary structure propensity peptide length pi or hydrophobicity and the ability of the peptides to associate into amyloid like fibrils however the presence of a relatively high content of aromatic side chains correlates with the ability of the peptides to form amyloid fibrils on the basis of these results we propose that residues     may be important in the self association of partially folded  m into amyloid fibrils and discuss the relevance of these results for the assembly mechanism of the intact protein in vitro
