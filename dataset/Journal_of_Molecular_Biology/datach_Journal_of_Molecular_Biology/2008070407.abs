design of protein  ligand binding based on the molecular mechanics energy model
while the molecular mechanics field has standardized on a few potential energy functions computational protein design efforts are based on potentials that are unique to individual laboratories here we show that a standard molecular mechanics potential energy function without any modifications can be used to engineer protein  ligand binding a molecular mechanics potential is used to reconstruct the coordinates of various binding sites with an average root mean square error of     and to reproduce known ligand induced side chain conformational shifts within a series of  mutants the calculation can always distinguish between weak kd gt  mm and tight kd lt    m binding sequences starting from partial coordinates of the ribose binding protein lacking the ligand and the  primary contact residues the molecular mechanics potential is used to redesign a ribose binding site out of a search space of     sequences the calculation selects a point mutant of the native protein as the top solution experimental kd    m and the native protein as the second best solution experimental kd   nm  the quality of the predictions depends on the accuracy of the generalized born electrostatics model treatment of protonation equilibria high resolution rotamer sampling a final local energy minimization step and explicit modeling of the bound unbound and unfolded states the application of unmodified molecular mechanics potentials to protein design links two fields in a mutually beneficial way design provides a new avenue for testing molecular mechanics energy functions and future improvements in these energy functions will presumably lead to more accurate design results
