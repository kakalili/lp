assembly and distributive action of an archaeal dna polymerase holoenzyme
the assembly and enzymatic ability of the replication dna polymerase holoenzyme from sulfolobus solfataricus sso was investigated using presteady state fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays coupled with functional and structural studies kinetic experiments reveal that atp binding to replication factor c rfc is sufficient for loading the heterotrimeric pcna   proliferating cell nuclear antigen pcna  clamp onto dna that includes a rate limiting conformational rearrangement of the complex atp hydrolysis is required for favorable recruitment and interactions with the replication polymerase polb  that most likely include clamp closing and rfc dissociation surprisingly the assembled holoenzyme complex synthesizes dna distributively and with low processivity unlike most other well characterized dna polymerase holoenzyme complexes we show that polb repeatedly disengages from the dna template leaving pcna  behind interactions with a newly identified c terminal pcna interacting peptide pip motif on polb specifically with pcna are required for holoenzyme formation and continuous re recruitment during synthesis the extended tail like structure of the c terminal pip motif in polb is revealed alone and when bound to dna using small angle x ray scattering allowing us to develop a model for the holoenzyme complex this is the first detailed kinetic description of clamp loading and holoenzyme assembly in crenarchaea and has revealed a novel mode for dynamic processivity that occurs by a polymerase exchange mechanism this work has important implications for processive dna replication synthesis and also suggests a potential mechanism for polymerase switching to bypass lesions
