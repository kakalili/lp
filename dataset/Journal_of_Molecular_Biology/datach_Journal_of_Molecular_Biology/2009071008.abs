the box h aca snornp assembly factor shq p is a chaperone protein homologous to hsp  cochaperones that binds to the cbf p enzyme
box h aca small nucleolar sno ribonucleoproteins rnps are responsible for the formation of pseudouridine in a variety of rnas and are essential for ribosome biogenesis modification of spliceosomal rnas and telomerase stability a mature snornp has been reconstituted in vitro and is composed of a single rna and four proteins however snornp biogenesis in vivo requires multiple factors to coordinate a complex and poorly understood assembly and maturation process among the factors required for snornp biogenesis in yeast is shq p an essential protein necessary for stable expression of box h aca snornas we have found that shq p consists of two independent domains that contain casein kinase  phosphorylation sites we also demonstrate that shq p binds the pseudourydilating enzyme cbf p through the c terminal domain in synergy with the n terminal domain the nmr solution structure of the n terminal domain has striking homology to the  chord and sgt   domain of known hsp  cochaperones yet shq p does not interact with the yeast hsp  homologue in vitro surprisingly shq p has stand alone chaperone activity in vitro this activity is harbored by the c terminal domain but it is increased by the presence of the n terminal domain these results provide the first evidence of a specific biochemical activity for shq p and a direct link to the h aca snornp
