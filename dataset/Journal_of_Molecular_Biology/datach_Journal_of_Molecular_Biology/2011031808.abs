initiation of translation of the fmr mrna occurs predominantly through   end dependent ribosomal scanning
the fragile x mental retardation  fmr  gene contains a cgg repeat within its   untranslated region   utr that when expanded to     cgg repeats premutation allele  can result in the late onset neurodegenerative disorder fragile x associated tremor ataxia syndrome the cgg repeat is expected to form a highly stable secondary structure that is capable of inhibiting   cap dependent translation paradoxically translation in vivo is only mildly impaired within the premutation range suggesting that other modes of translation initiation may be operating to address this issue we translated in vitro a set of reporter mrnas containing between  and  cgg repeats in either native fmr  or unrelated heterologous   utr context the   cap dependence of translation was assessed by inserting a stable hairpin hp near the   end of the mrnas the results of the current studies indicate that translation initiation of the fmr mrna occurs primarily by scanning with little evidence of internal ribosome entry or shunting additionally the efficiency of translation initiation depends on transcription start site selection with the shorter   utr downstream transcription start site i translating with greater efficiency compared to the longer mrna start site iii for all cgg repeat elements studied lastly an hp previously shown to block translation gave differing results depending on the   utr context in one case initiating translation from within the hp
