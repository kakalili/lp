the structure of dna bound human topoisomerase ii alpha conformational mechanisms for coordinating inter subunit interactions with dna cleavage
type ii topoisomerases are required for the management of dna superhelicity and chromosome segregation and serve as frontline targets for a variety of small molecule therapeutics to better understand how these enzymes act in both contexts we determined the      resolution structure of the dna cleavage core of human topoisomerase ii  top a bound to a doubly nicked    bp duplex oligonucleotide in accord with prior biochemical and structural studies top a significantly bends its dna substrate using a bipartite nucleolytic center formed at an n terminal dimerization interface of the cleavage core however the protein also adopts a global conformation in which the second of its two inter protomer contact points one at the c terminus has separated this finding together with comparative structural analyses reveals that the principal site of dna engagement undergoes highly quantized conformational transitions between distinct binding cleavage and drug inhibited states that correlate with the control of subunit  subunit interactions additional consideration of our top a model in light of an etoposide inhibited complex of human topoisomerase ii  top b suggests possible modification points for developing paralog specific inhibitors to overcome the tendency of topoisomerase ii targeting chemotherapeutics to generate secondary malignancies
