a structural model for the inhibition of calpain by calpastatin crystal structures of the native domain vi of calpain and its complexes with calpastatin peptide and a small molecule inhibitor
the ca  dependent cysteine protease calpain along with its endogenous inhibitor calpastatin is widely distributed the interactions between calpain and calpastatin have been studied to better understand the nature of calpain inhibition by calpastatin which can aid the design of small molecule inhibitors to calpain here we present the crystal structure of a complex between a calpastatin peptide and the calcium binding domain vi of calpain dic  is a  residue peptide which corresponds to one of the three interacting domains of calpastatin which is known to interact with domain vi of calpain we present two crystal structures of dic  bound to domain vi of calpain determined by molecular replacement methods to    and    resolution in the process of crystallizing the inhibitor complex a new native crystal form was identified which had the homodimer  fold axis along a crystallographic axis as opposed to the previously observed dimer in the asymmetric unit the crystal structures of the native domain vi and its inhibitor pd       iodophenyl  mercapto z  propenoic acid complex were determined with the help of molecular replacement methods to    and    resolution respectively in addition we built a homology model for the complex between domain iv and dia  peptide of calpastatin finally we present a model for the calpastatin inhibited calpain
