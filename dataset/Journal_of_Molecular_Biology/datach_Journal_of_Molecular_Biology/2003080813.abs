structural insight into how an anti idiotypic antibody against d h  anti tissue factor antibody restores normal coagulation
a is a murine monoclonal antibody raised against the humanized anti tissue factor antibody d h   a is able to completely neutralize the anticoagulant activity of d h  in tissue factor dependent functional assays such as endotoxin induced whole blood clotting prothrombin time as well as factor x and factor ix activation elisa type assays further showed that a binds to an epitope with critical determinants on the vl domain of d h  the possibility that the anti idiotypic a might carry an  internal image  of the original antigen tissue factor was examined using the x ray structure of the a fab d h  fab complex determined at    resolution we find that a structurally mimics tissue factor only so far as it combines with the antigen recognition surface of d h  while a contacts both vl and vh domains of d h  as does tissue factor there is more contact with the d h  vl domain and less with the d h  vh domain relative to the tissue factor contacts on d h  additionally there is an almost total lack of correspondence between a and tissue factor at the level of amino acid side chain functional groups despite the fact that both tissue factor and a are composed largely of  sheets they present fundamentally different elements of secondary structure to d h  tissue factor presents  sheets edge on while a uses mostly loops finally the finding that a competes with tissue factor for d h  binding raises the possibility of using a as an antidote for d h  anticoagulant therapy to this end we constructed a chimeric murine human a fab which effectively neutralized d h  and fully restored tissue factor function in enzymatic assays
