crystallographic evidence for water assisted photo induced peptide cleavage in the stony coral fluorescent protein kaede
a coral fluorescent protein from trachyphyllia geoffroyi kaede possesses a tripeptide of his  tyr  gly  which forms a chromophore with green fluorescence this chromophore s fluorescence turns red following uv light irradiation we have previously shown that such photoconversion is achieved by a formal  elimination reaction which results in a cleavage of the peptide bond found between the amide nitrogen and the  carbon at his  however the stereochemical arrangement of the chromophore and the precise structural basis for this reaction mechanism previously remained unknown here we report the crystal structures of the green and red form of kaede at     and     resolutions respectively our structures depict the cleaved peptide bond in the red form the chromophore conformations both in the green and red forms are similar except a well defined water molecule in the proximity of the his  imidazole ring in the green form we propose a molecular mechanism for green to red photoconversion which is assisted by the water molecule
