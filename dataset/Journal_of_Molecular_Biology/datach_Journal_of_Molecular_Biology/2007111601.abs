an allosteric rheostat in hiv  gp  reduces ccr stoichiometry required for membrane fusion and overcomes diverse entry limitations
binding of the human immunodeficiency virus hiv  envelope glycoprotein gp  to the ccr co receptor reduces constraints on the metastable transmembrane subunit gp  thereby enabling gp  refolding fusion of viral and cellular membranes and infection we previously isolated adapted hiv jrcsf variants that more efficiently use mutant ccr s including ccr    lacking the important tyrosine sulfate containing amino terminus effects of mutant ccr concentrations on hiv  infectivities were highly cooperative implying that several may be required however because wild type ccr efficiently mediates infections at trace concentrations that were difficult to measure accurately analyses of its cooperativity were not feasible new hiv jrcsf variants efficiently use ccr hhmh  a chimera containing murine extracellular loop  the adapted virus induces large syncytia in cells containing either wild type or mutant ccr s and has multiple gp  mutations that occurred independently in ccr    adapted virus accordingly these variants interchangeably use ccr hhmh or ccr     additional analyses strongly support a novel energetic model for allosteric proteins implying that the adaptive mutations reduce quaternary constraints holding gp  thus lowering the activation energy barrier for membrane fusion without affecting bonds to specific ccr sites in accordance with this mechanism highly adapted hiv s require only one associated ccr hhmh  whereas poorly adapted viruses require several however because they are allosteric ensembles complexes with additional co receptors fuse more rapidly and efficiently than minimal ones similarly wild type hiv jrcsf is highly adapted to wild type ccr and minimally requires one the adaptive mutations cause resistances to diverse entry inhibitors and cluster appropriately in the gp  trimer interface overlying gp  we conclude that membrane fusion complexes are allosteric machines with an ensemble of compositions and that hiv  adapts to entry limitations by gp  mutations that reduce its allosteric hold on gp  these results provide an important foundation for understanding the mechanisms that control membrane fusion and hiv  s facile adaptability
