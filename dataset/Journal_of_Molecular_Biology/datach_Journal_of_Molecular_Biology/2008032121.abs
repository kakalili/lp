structure of the tandem fibronectin type  domains of neural cell adhesion molecule
activation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor fgfr by neural cell adhesion molecule ncam is essential for ncam mediated neurite outgrowth previous peptide studies have identified two regions in the fibronectin type  fn  like domains of ncam as being important for these activities here we report the crystal structure of the ncam fn domain tandem which reveals an acutely bent domain arrangement mutation of a non conserved surface residue m  r led to a second crystal form showing a substantially different conformation thus the fn domain linker is highly flexible suggesting that it corresponds to the hinge seen in electron micrographs of ncam the two putative fgfr binding segments one in each ncam fn domain are situated close to the domain interface they form a contiguous patch in the more severely bent conformation but become separated upon straightening of the fn tandem suggesting that conformational changes within ncam may modulate fgfr activation surface plasmon resonance experiments demonstrated only a very weak interaction between the ncam fn tandem and soluble fgfr proteins expressed in mammalian cells dissociation constant gt    m  thus the ncam  fgfr interaction at the cell surface is likely to depend upon avidity effects due to receptor clustering
