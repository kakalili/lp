analysis of a cell cycle promoter bound by a response regulator edited by m yaniv
caulobacter crescentus ctra protein an ompr type response regulator receives cell cycle signals and binds the proposed consensus ttaa n ttaa present inside the chromosome replication origin and cell cycle transcription promoters we synthesized a  bp cell cycle promoter based on this consensus and elements of the flil promoter over   promoter mutations were assayed for transcription directed by ctra although both ctra binding half sites cooperate and the n spacing is critical for transcription the upstream half site is relatively flexible the downstream ctra half site is less flexible and more important for cell cycle regulation a ctra binding site and a    promoter element are sufficient for cell cycle transcription and both sequences cooperate and compensate for respective defects mutations in the ctra binding site but not in the    promoter sequence perturb cell cycle transcription a single base pair change switches a cell cycle promoter into a strong conventional promoter we propose rules for ctra binding and promoter interactions implying how ctra evolved into a versatile regulator of cell cycle functions including flagellar biogenesis cell division dna methylation and chromosome replication
