kinetics of paused ribosome recycling in escherichia coli
the bacterial tmrna smpb system recycles stalled translation complexes in a process termed  ribosome rescue   tmrna smpb specifically recognizes ribosomes that are paused at or near the   end of truncated mrna therefore nucleolytic mrna processing is required before paused ribosomes can be rescued from full length transcripts here we examine the recycling of ribosomes paused on both full length and truncated mrnas peptidyl trnas corresponding to each paused translation complex were identified and their turnover kinetics was used to estimate the half lives of paused ribosomes in vivo ribosomes were paused at stop codons on full length mrna using a nascent peptide motif that interferes with translation termination and elicits tmrna smpb activity peptidyl trna turnover from these termination paused ribosomes was slightly more rapid in tmrna cells t       s than in  tmrna cells t       s  overexpression of release factor rf  greatly accelerated peptidyl trna turnover from termination paused ribosomes in both tmrna and  tmrna cells whereas other termination factors had little or no effect on recycling in contrast to inefficient translation termination ribosome recycling from truncated transcripts lacking in frame stop codons was dramatically accelerated by tmrna smpb however peptidyl trna still turned over from nonstop paused ribosomes at a significant rate t       s in  tmrna cells overexpression of rf  rf  and ribosome recycling factor in  tmrna cells failed to accelerate ribosome recycling from nonstop mrna these results indicate that tmrna smpb activity is rate limited by mrna cleavage and that rf  and ribosome recycling factor do not constitute a tmrna independent rescue pathway as previously suggested peptidyl trna turnover from nonstop paused ribosomes in  tmrna cells suggests the existence of another uncharacterized ribosome rescue pathway
