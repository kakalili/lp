the rtp site shared by the hiv  tat protein and the  s regulator subunit  is crucial for their effects on proteasome function including antigen processing
the human immunodeficiency virus  tat protein inhibits the peptidase activity of the  s proteasome and competes with the  s regulator pa  for binding to the  s proteasome structural comparison revealed a common site in the tat protein and the  s regulator  subunit reg  called the reg tat proteasome binding rtp site kinetic assays found amino acid residues lys  arg  and asp  forming the rtp site of tat to be responsible for the effects on proteasomes in vitro the rtp site identified in reg  consists of the residues glu   lys  and lys   mutation of the reg  amino acid residues glu  and lys  to ala resulted in an reg  mutant that lost the ability to activate the  s proteasome even though it still forms complexes with reg  and binds to the  s proteasome the reg  rtp site is needed to enhance the presentation of a cytomegalovirus pp  protein derived epitope by mhc class i molecules in mouse fibroblasts cell experiments demonstrate that the tat amino acid residues     are necessary for the interaction of the viral protein with proteasomes in vivo full length tat and the tat peptide     suppressed  s regulator mediated presentation of the pp  epitope in contrast the tat peptide     with mutations of amino acid residues lys  arg  and asp  to ala was not able to reduce antigen presentation
