concerted motions in hiv  tar rna may allow access to bound state conformations rna dynamics from nmr residual dipolar couplings edited by m f summers
ground state dynamics in rna is a critical precursor for structural adaptation observed ubiquitously in protein rna recognition a tertiary conformational analysis of the stem loop structural element in the transactivation response element tar from human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv i rna is presented using recently introduced nmr methods that rely on the measurement of residual dipolar couplings rdc in partially oriented systems order matrix analysis of rdc data provides evidence for inter helical motions that are of amplitude       of random directional character and that are executed about an average conformation with an inter helical angle between    and    the generated ensemble of tar conformations have different organizations of functional groups responsible for interaction with the trans activator protein tat including conformations similar to the previously characterized bound state conformation these results demonstrate the utility of rdc nmr for simultaneously characterizing rna tertiary dynamics and average conformation and indicate an avenue for tar complex formation involving tertiary structure capture
