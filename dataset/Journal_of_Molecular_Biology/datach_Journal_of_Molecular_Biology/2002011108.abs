critical role of helix  of the vitamin d receptor for the partial agonism of carboxylic ester antagonists edited by r huber
the carboxy terminal  helix of a nuclear receptor ligand binding domain lbd  helix   contains a critical ligand modulated interface for the interaction with coactivator proteins in this study using the example of the vitamin d receptor vdr and the partial antagonist zk    the role of helix   residues     for both antagonistic and agonistic receptor actions was investigated amino acid residue g  was demonstrated to be critical for partial agonism of zk    but not for the activity of the natural vdr agonist     dihydroxyvitamin d     oh d  the amount of partial agonism of zk    increased when helix  was truncated by the last four amino acid residues      and augmented even more when in addition helix  of vdr  s dimerization partner retinoid x receptor rxr  was truncated in contrast the low agonism of a structural derivative of zk    zk    was not affected comparably whereas other close structural relatives of zk    even demonstrated the same agonistic activity as that of    oh d  the amount of agonism of zk    and zk    at different variations of helix  correlated well with vdr  s ability to complex with coactivator proteins and inversely correlated with the strength of the compound  s antagonistic action on    oh d signalling molecular dynamics simulations of the lbd complexed with the two antagonists could explain their different action by demonstrating a more drastic displacement of helix  through zk    than through zk    moreover the modelling could indicate a kink of helix  at amino acid residue g   which provides the last four amino acid residues of helix  with a modulatory role for the partial agonism of some vdr antagonists such as zk    in conclusion partial agonism of a vdr antagonist is lower the more it disturbs helix  in taking the optimal position for coactivator interaction
