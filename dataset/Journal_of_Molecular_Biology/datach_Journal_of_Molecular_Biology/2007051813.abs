quantitative analysis of peroxisomal targeting signal type  binding to wild type and pathogenic mutants of pex p supports an affinity threshold for peroxisomal protein targeting
peroxisomal biogenesis disorders pbds are caused by mutations in  distinct genes that encode the components of the peroxisome assembly machinery three mutations in the gene encoding pex p the peroxisomal targeting signal type  pts  receptor have been reported each associated with a disorder of the zellweger spectrum of different severity here we report studies of the affinities of mutated forms of pex p for a series of pts peptides and conclude that pts affinity reductions are correlated with disease severity and cell biological phenotype a quantitative model has been developed that allows estimation of the dissociation constants for complexes with a wide range of pts sequences bound to wild type and mutant pex p in the context of this model the binding measurements suggest that no pts containing proteins are targeted by pex p n  k and only a relatively small subset of pts containing proteins with the highest affinity for pex p are targeted to peroxisomes by pex p s  w  furthermore the results of the analysis are consistent with an approximate dissociation constant threshold near   nm required for efficient protein targeting to peroxisomes
