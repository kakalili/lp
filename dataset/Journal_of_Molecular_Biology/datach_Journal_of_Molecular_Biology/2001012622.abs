localization of the rar interaction domain of cellular retinoic acid binding protein ii edited by m gottesman
the pleiotropic effects of retinoic acid ra in mammalian cells are mediated by two classes of proteins the retinoic acid receptors rar  and cellular retinoic acid binding proteins crabp i and crabp ii  the high conservation across species and the differential expression patterns of the two crabps suggest that they serve distinct biological functions we previously showed that crabp ii but not crabp i delivers ra to rar through direct protein protein interactions between the binding protein and the receptor   channeling  of ra between crabp ii and rar markedly facilitates the formation of the holo receptor and as a consequence enhances the transcriptional activity of rar in cells here we localize the region of crabp ii that mediates the interactions of this protein with rar comparison between the electrostatic surface potential of crabp i and ii revealed the presence of a sole region displaying a dramatic potential change between the two isoforms examination of the underlying model revealed that the change stemmed from crabp i crabp ii substitution of three spatially aligned residues e q k p and e  k located on a protrusion above the entrance to the ligand binding pocket of the protein substituting the corresponding crabp ii residues onto crabp i conferred upon this protein the ability to channel ra to rar and to enhance the transcriptional activity of rar in cells conversely converting these amino acid residues in crabp ii to the homologous crabp i residues resulted in loss of the ability of crabp ii to interact with rar and to augment the receptor  s activity the data demonstrate that the surface region of crabp ii containing residues gln  pro  and lys  is necessary and sufficient for mediating the interactions of this protein with rar facilitating the formation of the holo receptor and enhancing the transcriptional activity of ra
