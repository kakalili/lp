Protein synthesis is believed to be a dynamic process, involving structural rearrangements of the ribosome. Cryo-EM reconstructions of certain elongation factor G (EF-G)-containing complexes have led to the proposal that translocation of tRNA and mRNA through the ribosome, from the A to P to E sites, is accompanied by a rotational movement between the two ribosomal subunits. Here, we have used Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) to monitor changes in the relative orientation of the ribosomal subunits in different complexes trapped at intermediate stages of translocation in solution. Binding of EF-G to the ribosome in the presence of the non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue GDPNP or GTP plus fusidic acid causes an increase in the efficiency of energy transfer between fluorophores introduced into proteins S11 in the 30 S subunit and L9 in the 50 S subunit, and a decrease in energy transfer between S6 and L9. Similar anti-correlated changes in energy transfer occur upon binding the GTP-requiring release factor RF3. These changes are consistent with the counter-clockwise rotation of the 30 S subunit relative to the 50 S subunit observed in cryo-EM studies. Reaction of ribosomal complexes containing the peptidyl-tRNA analogues N-Ac-Phe-tRNAPhe, N-Ac-Met-tRNAMet or f-Met-tRNAfMet with puromycin, conditions favoring movement of the resulting deacylated tRNAs into the P/E hybrid state, leads to similar changes in FRET. Conversely, treatment of a ribosomal complex containing deacylated and peptidyl-tRNAs bound in the A/P and P/E states, respectively, with EF-G·GTP causes reversal of the FRET changes. The use of FRET has enabled direct observation of intersubunit movement in solution, provides independent evidence that formation of the hybrid state is coupled to rotation of the 30 S subunit and shows that the intersubunit movement is reversed during the second step of translocation.
