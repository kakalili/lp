the structure and computational analysis of mycobacterium tuberculosis protein cite suggest a novel enzymatic function
fatty acid biosynthesis is essential for the survival of mycobacterium tuberculosis and acetyl coenzyme a acetyl coa is an essential precursor in this pathway we have determined the  d crystal structure of m tuberculosis citrate lyase  subunit cite  which as annotated should cleave protein bound citryl coa to oxaloacetate and a protein bound coa derivative the cite structure has the     tim barrel fold with an additional  helix and is trimeric we have determined the ternary complex bound with oxaloacetate and magnesium revealing some of the conserved residues involved in catalysis while the bacterial citrate lyase is a complex with three subunits the m tuberculosis genome does not contain the  and  subunits of this complex implying that m tuberculosis cite acts differently from other bacterial cite proteins the analysis of gene clusters containing the cite protein from   fully sequenced organisms has led us to identify a grouping of functionally related genes preserved in m tuberculosis rattus norvegicus homo sapiens and mus musculus we propose a novel enzymatic function for m tuberculosis cite in fatty acid biosynthesis that is analogous to bacterial citrate lyase but producing acetyl coa rather than a protein bound coa derivative
