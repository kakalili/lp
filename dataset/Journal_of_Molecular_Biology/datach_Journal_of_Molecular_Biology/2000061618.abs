characterization of a conserved  helical coiled coil motif at the c terminal domain of the atp dependent ftsh hflb protease of escherichia coli edited by j karn
ftsh hflb is an atp dependent protease found in prokaryotic cells mitochondria and chloroplasts here we have identified in the carboxy terminal region of ftsh hfib  a short  helix predicted of forming a coiled coil leucine zipper structure this region appears to be structurally conserved the presence of the coiled coil motif in the escherichia coli ftsh hflb was demonstrated by circular dichroism and cross linking experiments mutational analysis showed that three highly conserved leucine residues are essential for ftsh hfib activity in vivo and in vitro purified proteins mutated in the conserved leucine residues were found to be defective in the degradation of e coli   and the bacteriophage  cii proteins in addition the mutant proteins were defective in the binding of cii the mutations did not interfere with the atpase activity of ftsh hflb  finally the mutant proteins were found to be more sensitive to trypsin degradation than the wild type enzyme suggesting that the  helical region is an important structural element of ftsh hflb
