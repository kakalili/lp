structural analysis of cyp r in complex with vitamin d
the activation of vitamin d to its hormonal form is mediated by cytochrome p  enzymes cyp r catalyzes the initial step converting vitamin d into  hydroxyvitamin d a cyp r gene mutation causes an inherited form of rickets due to  hydroxylase deficiency to understand the narrow substrate specificity of cyp r we obtained the hemeprotein in a highly purified state confirmed the enzyme as a vitamin d  hydroxylase and solved the crystal structure of cyp r in complex with vitamin d  the cyp r structure adopts a closed conformation with the substrate access channel being covered by the ordered b  helix and slightly opened to the surface which defines the substrate entrance point the active site is lined by conserved mostly hydrophobic residues vitamin d is bound in an elongated conformation with the aliphatic side chain pointing toward the heme the structure reveals the secosteroid binding mode in an extended active site and allows rationalization of the molecular basis of the inherited rickets associated with cyp r
