effects of turn stability and side chain hydrophobicity on the folding of  structures
key elements of  structure folding include hydrophobic core collapse turn formation and assembly of backbone hydrogen bonds in the present folding simulations of several  hairpins and  sheets peptide  protein g b domain peptide trpzip  trpzip   mer and  merdp d  the folding free energy landscape as a function of several reaction coordinates corresponding to the three key elements indicates apparent dependence on turn stability and side chain hydrophobicity which demonstrates different folding mechanisms of similar  structures of varied sequences turn stability is found to be the key factor in determining the formation order of the three structural elements in the folding of  structures moreover turn stability and side chain hydrophobicity both affect the stability of backbone hydrogen bonds the three stranded  sheets fold through a three state transition in which the formation of one hairpin always takes precedence over the other the different stabilities of two anti parallel hairpins in each three stranded  sheet are shown to correlate well with the different levels of their hydrophobic interactions
