the structure of the crispr associated protein csa provides insight into the regulation of the crispr cas system
adaptive immune systems have recently been recognized in prokaryotic organisms where in response to viral infection they incorporate short fragments of invader derived dna into loci called clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats crisprs  in subsequent infections the crispr loci are transcribed and processed into guide sequences for the neutralization of the invading rna or dna the crispr associated protein machinery cas lies at the heart of this process yet many of the molecular details of the crispr cas system remain to be elucidated here we report the first structure of csa  a crispr associated protein from sulfolobus solfataricus sso    which reveals a dimeric two domain protein the n terminal domain is a unique variation on the dinucleotide binding domain that orchestrates dimer formation in addition it utilizes two conserved sequence motifs thr h gly phe asn asp glu x arg and leu x gly h arg to construct a  fold symmetric pocket on the dimer axis this pocket is likely to represent a regulatory ligand binding site the n terminal domain is fused to a c terminal marr like winged helix  turn  helix domain that is expected to be involved in dna recognition overall the unique domain architecture of csa suggests a transcriptional regulator under allosteric control of the n terminal domain alternatively csa may function in a larger complex with the conserved cleft participating in protein  protein or protein  nucleic acid interactions a similar n terminal domain is also identified in csx  a second crispr associated protein family of unknown function
