the transthyretin amyloidoses from delineating the molecular mechanism of aggregation linked to pathology to a regulatory agency approved drug
transthyretin ttr is one of the many proteins that are known to misfold and aggregate i e  undergo amyloidogenesis in vivo the process of ttr amyloidogenesis causes nervous system and or heart pathology while several of these maladies are associated with mutations that destabilize the native ttr quaternary and or tertiary structure wild type ttr amyloidogenesis also leads to the degeneration of postmitotic tissue over the past   years much has been learned about the factors that influence the propensity of ttr to aggregate this biophysical information led to the development of a therapeutic strategy termed  kinetic stabilization   to prevent ttr amyloidogenesis this strategy afforded the drug tafamidis which was recently approved by the european medicines agency for the treatment of ttr familial amyloid polyneuropathy the most common familial ttr amyloid disease tafamidis is the first and currently the only medication approved to treat ttr familial amyloid polyneuropathy here we review the biophysical basis for the kinetic stabilization strategy and the structure based drug design effort that led to this first in class pharmacologic agent
