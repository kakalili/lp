crystal structure of human myosin c  the motor in glut exocytosis implications for ca  regulation and    binding
myosin c myo c plays a key role in supporting motile events that underlie cell migration vesicle trafficking insulin stimulated glucose uptake and hearing here we present the crystal structure of the human myo c motor in complex with its light chain calmodulin our structure reveals tight interactions of the motor domain with calmodulin bound to the first iq motif in the neck region several of the calmodulin residues contributing to this interaction are also involved in ca  binding contact residues in the motor domain are linked to the central  sheet and the ho helix suggesting a mechanism for communicating changes in ca  binding in the neck region to the actin and nucleotide binding regions of the motor domain the structural context and the chemical environment of myo c mutations that are involved in sensorineural hearing loss in humans are described and their impact on motor function is discussed we show that a construct consisting of the motor domain of myo c and the first iq motif is sufficient to establish a tight interaction with      kd   m and present the model of a double headed myo c     complex this complex has been implicated in the exocytosis of glucose transporter  storage vesicles during insulin stimulated glucose uptake
