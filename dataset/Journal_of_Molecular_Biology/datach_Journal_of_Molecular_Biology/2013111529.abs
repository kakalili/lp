dissection of androgen receptor  promoter interactions steroid receptors partition their interaction energetics in parallel with their phylogenetic divergence
steroid receptors comprise a homologous family of ligand activated transcription factors the members include androgen receptor ar  estrogen receptor er  glucocorticoid receptor gr  mineralocorticoid receptor mr  and progesterone receptor pr  phylogenetic studies demonstrate that ar gr mr and pr are most closely related falling into subgroup c er is more distantly related falling into subgroup a to determine the quantitative basis by which receptors generate their unique transcriptional responses we are systematically dissecting the promoter binding energetics of all receptors under a single  standard state  condition here we examine the self assembly and promoter binding energetics of full length ar and a mutant associated with prostate cancer t  a we first demonstrate that both proteins exist only as monomers showing no evidence of dimerization although this result contradicts the traditional understanding that steroid receptors dimerize in the absence of dna it is fully consistent with our previous work demonstrating that gr and two pr isoforms either do not dimerize or dimerize only weakly moreover both ar proteins exhibit substantial cooperativity between binding sites again as seen for gr and pr in sharp contrast the more distantly related er  dimerizes so strongly that energetics can only be measured indirectly yet cooperativity is negligible thus homologous receptors partition their promoter binding energetics quite differently moreover since receptors most closely related by phylogeny partition their energetics similarly such partitioning appears to be evolutionarily conserved we speculate that such differences in energetics coupled with different promoter architectures serve as the basis for generating receptor specific promoter occupancy and thus function
