three dimensional structure of a presynaptic neurotoxic phospholipase a from daboia russelli pulchella at    resolution edited by d rees
the phospholipase a from daboia russelli pulchella dpla  is the only known member of subclass ii of group iia the three dimensional structure of this presynaptic neurotoxic dpla enzyme has been determined at    resolution the structure was determined by the molecular replacement method using the model crotalus atrox and refined using x plor to a final r factor of    for all data in the resolution range          the final refined model comprises   atoms from two crystallographically independent protein molecules and   water oxygen atoms the overall folding of dpla  with three long helices and two short antiparallel  strands is grossly similar to those observed for other pla s in the present structure the calcium binding site is empty but the conformation of the calcium binding loop is similar to those observed in the calcium bound states two spatially adjacent regions of residues     a typical  turn i and     a well defined loop are remarkably different in conformation electrostatic characteristics and inter segmental interactions from those found in non neurotoxic pla s yet another striking structural feature in dpla pertains to the stretch of residues     which has a series of positively charged residues protruding outwardly the above segment is presumed to be involved in the anticoagulant activity a unique hydrophobic patch including residues leu  ala  ile  pro  phe  and leu  is found on the surface together with an equally emphatic region of oh groups containing residues such as ser  tyr  ser  ser  tyr  and tyr  the interactions between two molecules of dpla in the asymmetric unit are remarkably different from those observed in the standard dimers and trimers of pla s leaving the enzyme  s active site fully exposed for enzyme substrate reactions it makes this structure one of the most favourable examples for structure based drug design through soaking experiments
