mitochondrial f fo atp synthase the small subunits e and g associate with monomeric complexes to trigger dimerization
mitochondrial f fo atp synthase catalyzes the formation of atp from adp and inorganic phosphate the enzyme is found in monomeric dimeric and higher oligomeric forms in the inner mitochondrial membrane dimerization of atp synthase complexes is a prerequisite for the generation of larger oligomers that promote membrane bending and formation of tubular cristae membranes two small proteins of the membrane embedded fo domain subunit e su e atp  and su g atp   were identified as dimer specific subunits of yeast atp synthase and shown to be required for stabilization of the dimers we have identified two distinct monomeric forms of yeast atp synthase su e and su g are present not only in the dimer but also in one of the monomeric forms we demonstrate that su e and su g sequentially assemble with monomeric atp synthase to form a dimerization competent primed monomer we conclude that association of su e and su g with monomeric f fo atp synthase represents an initial step of oligomer formation
