allosteric drugs the interaction of antitumor compound mkt   with human hsp  chaperones
hsp  heat shock protein   kda chaperones are key to cellular protein homeostasis however they also have the ability to inhibit tumor apoptosis and contribute to aberrant accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in neuronal cells affected by tauopathies including alzheimer s disease hence hsp  chaperones are increasingly becoming identified as targets for therapeutic intervention in these widely abundant diseases hsp  proteins are allosteric machines and offer besides classical active site targets also opportunities to target the mechanism of allostery in this work it is demonstrated that the action of the potent anticancer compound mkt    ethyl    ethyl   methylbenzothiazolin  yliden   oxothiazolidin  ylidenemethyl pyridinium chloride occurs through a differential interaction with hsp  allosteric states mkt   is therefore an  allosteric drug   using nmr spectroscopy we identify the compound s binding site on human hspa  hsc   the binding pose is obtained from nmr restrained docking calculations subsequently scored by molecular dynamics based energy and solvation computations suggestions for the improvement of the compound s properties are made on the basis of the binding location and pose
