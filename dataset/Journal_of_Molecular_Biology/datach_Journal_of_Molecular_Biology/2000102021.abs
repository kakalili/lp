dissecting the hydrogen exchange properties of insulin under amyloid fibril forming conditions a site specific investigation by mass spectrometry edited by p e wright
we have examined the hydrogen exchange properties of bovine insulin under solution conditions that cause it to aggregate and eventually form amyloid fibrils the results have been obtained at the residue specific level using peptic digestion and mass spectrometry a total of  peptides were assigned to regions of the protein and their exchange properties monitored for a period of  hours the results of the peptic digestion show that residues a  to a  and b  to b  are more susceptible to proteolysis than the n terminal regions of the protein a total of  slowly exchanging amides were observed for insulin under these solution conditions location of the protected amides was carried out using a peptic digestion protocol at low ph chromatographic separation was not required this enabled a direct comparison of the peptides within the same mass spectrum from kinetic analysis of the rates slow exchange has been located to    backbone amides in the a  a  helix and    in the b chain helix the remaining    are assigned to helix a a  taken together the results from digestion and hydrogen exchange show that at low ph and relatively high concentrations the c termini of both chains are susceptible to proteolysis but that the solution structure contains the native state helices more generally the results demonstrate that mass spectrometry can be applied to study site specific hydrogen exchange properties of proteins even under conditions where they are known to be partially folded and aggregate extensively in solution
