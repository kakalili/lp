the    resolution crystal structure of glycosomal pyruvate phosphate dikinase from trypanosoma brucei
the crystal structure of the glycosomal enzyme pyruvate phosphate dikinase from the african protozoan parasite trypanosoma brucei has been solved to    resolution by molecular replacement the search model was the    resolution structure of the clostridium symbiosum enzyme due to different relative orientations of the domains and sub domains in the two structures molecular replacement could be achieved only by positioning these elements four bodies altogether sequentially in the asymmetric unit of the p   crystal which contains one pyruvate phosphate dikinase ppdk subunit the refined model comprising   residues and   solvent molecules per subunit has a crystallographic residual index rf    cross validation residual index rfree    and displays satisfactory stereochemistry eight regions comprising a total of  amino acid residues at the surface of the molecule are disordered in this crystal form the ppdk subunits are arranged around the crystallographic  fold axis as a dimer analogous to that observed in the c symbiosum enzyme comparison of the two structures was carried out by superposition of the models although the fold of each domain or sub domain is similar the relative orientations of these constitutive elements are different in the two structures the trypanosome enzyme is more  bent  than the bacterial enzyme with bending increasing from the center of the molecule close to the molecular  fold axis towards the periphery where the n terminal domain is located as a consequence of this increased bending and of the differences in relative positions of sub domains the nucleotide binding cleft in the amino terminal domain is wider in t brucei ppdk the n terminal fragment of the amino terminal domain is distant from the catalytic phospho transfer competent histidine   ca   away  our observations suggest that the requirements of domain motion during enzyme catalysis might include widening of the nucleotide binding cleft to allow access and departure of the amp or atp ligand
