histone recognition by human malignant brain tumor domains
histone methylation has emerged as an important covalent modification involved in a variety of biological processes especially regulation of transcription and chromatin dynamics lysine methylation is found in three distinct states monomethylation dimethylation and trimethylation  which are recognized by specific protein domains the malignant brain tumor mbt domain is one such module found in several chromatin regulatory complexes including polycomb repressive complex  here we present a comprehensive characterization of the human mbt family with emphasis on histone binding specificity spot blot peptide arrays were used to screen for the methyllysine containing histone peptides that bind to mbt domains found in nine human proteins selected interactions were quantified using fluorescence polarization assays we show that all mbt proteins recognize only monomethyllysine and or dimethyllysine marks and provide evidence that some mbt domains recognize a defined consensus sequence while others bind in a promiscuous non sequence  specific manner furthermore using structure based mutants we identify a triad of residues in the methyllysine binding pocket that imparts discrimination between monomethyllysine and dimethyllysine this study represents a comprehensive analysis of mbt substrate specificity establishing a foundation for the rational design of selective mbt domain inhibitors that may enable elucidation of their role in human biology and disease
