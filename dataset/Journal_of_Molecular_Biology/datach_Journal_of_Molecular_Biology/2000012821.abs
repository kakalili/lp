localized stereochemically sensitive hydrophobic packing in an early folding intermediate of dihydrofolate reductase from escherichia coli edited by p e wright
mutational analysis was performed to probe the development of hydrophobic clusters during the early events in the folding of dihydrofolate reductase replacements were made in several hydrophobic subdomains to examine the roles of hydrophobicity and stereochemistry in the formation of kinetic intermediates amide protons in two of these clusters including residues i  i  and i   have been shown to be protected against solvent exchange within  ms of folding additional hydrophobic clusters were probed by substitutions at residues i  i  and l   these residues are not protected from exchange until later in the folding reaction valine and leucine replacements at positions i  i  and i  significantly diminish the formation of the burst phase kinetic intermediate relative to the wild type protein in contrast i and i  are insensitive to these substitutions in the first  ms of the folding reaction as is the replacement of l  with either isoleucine or valine these results demonstrate that the tightly packed core of dihydrofolate reductase is acquired in a non uniform fashion beginning in the submillisecond time frame the progressive development of specific side chain packing in localized hydrophobic clusters may be a common theme for complex protein folding reactions
