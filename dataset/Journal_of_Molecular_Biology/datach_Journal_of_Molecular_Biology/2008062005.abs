solution structure of the inner dysf domain of myoferlin and implications for limb girdle muscular dystrophy type b
mutations in the protein dysferlin a member of the ferlin family lead to limb girdle muscular dystrophy type b and myoshi myopathy the ferlins are large proteins characterised by multiple c domains and a single c terminal membrane spanning helix however there is sequence conservation in some of the ferlin family in regions outside the c domains in one annotation of the domain structure of these proteins an unusual internal duplication event has been noted where a putative domain is inserted in between the n and c terminal parts of a homologous domain this domain is known as the dysf domain here we present the solution structure of the inner dysf domain of the dysferlin paralogue myoferlin which has a unique fold held together by stacking of arginine and tryptophans mutations that lead to clinical disease in dysferlin
