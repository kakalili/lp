the dna binding protein h ns binds to and alters the stability of rna in vitro and in vivo
h ns is an abundant prokaryotic transcription factor that preferentially binds to intrinsically bent dna although h ns has been shown to reduce the transcription of over   genes evidence suggests that h ns can also affect the translation of some genes one such gene rpos specifies a sigma factor rpos the ability of h ns to bind to the rpos mrna and the non coding rna regulator dsra was tested electrophoretic mobility shift assays yielded an apparent binding affinity of h ns binding to curved dna of approximately   m whereas binding to rpos mrna or dsra rna was approximately   m this rna binding was not prevented by an excess of competitor yeast rna suggesting that h ns specifically bound these rnas footprint analysis with a single strand specific ribonuclease was used to identify the h ns binding site s on dsra and rpos mrna surprisingly h ns appeared to enhance the cleavage of dsra and rpos mrna the enhanced cleavage was at sites that were predicted to be single stranded and did not result from contaminating nucleases in the h ns protein preparation or non specific effects of the nuclease quantitative rt pcr of rna isolated from wild type and hns  strains revealed that h ns also affects the stability of dsra in vivo thus h ns appears to modulate rna stability in vivo and in vitro
