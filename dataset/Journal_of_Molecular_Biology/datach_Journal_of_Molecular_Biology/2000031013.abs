crystal structure of lys   lys   crosslinked hemoglobin a possible allosteric intermediate edited by k nagai
the crystal structure of human hemoglobin crosslinked between the lys   residues has been determined at     resolution the crosslinking reaction was performed under oxy conditions using bis   dibromosalicyl fumarate the modified hemoglobin has increased oxygen affinity and lacks cooperativity since the crystallization occurred under deoxy conditions the resulting structure displays conformational characteristics of both the oxy r and the deoxy t states   xlhba does not fully reach its t state conformation due to the presence of the crosslink the r state like characteristics of deoxy   xlhba include the position of the distal his   e  residue indicating a possible reason for the high oxygen affinity of this derivative other areas of the molecule particularly those thought to be important in the allosteric transition such as tyr    hc  and the switch region involving pro    cd  thr    c  and his    fg  are in intermediate positions between the r and t states thus the structure may represent a stabilized intermediate in the allosteric transition of hemoglobin
