salicylate   dioxygenase from pseudaminobacter salicylatoxidans crystal structure of a peculiar ring cleaving dioxygenase
the crystallographic structure of salicylate   dioxygenase sdo  a new ring fission dioxygenase from the naphthalenesulfonate degrading strain pseudaminobacter salicylatoxidans bn  which oxidizes salicylate to  oxohepta   dienedioic acid by a novel ring fission mechanism has been solved by molecular replacement techniques and refined at     resolution rfree    r factor     sdo is a homo tetramer member of type iii extradiol type dioxygenases with a subunit topology characteristic of the bicupin  barrel folds the catalytic center contains a mononuclear iron ii ion coordinated to three histidine residues his   his   and his   located within the n terminal domain in a solvent accessible pocket sdo is markedly different from the known gentisate   dioxygenases gdo or  hydroxy  naphthoate dioxygenase because of its unique ability to oxidatively cleave numerous salicylates gentisates and  hydroxy  naphthoate with high catalytic efficiency the comparison of the structure and substrate specificity for a series of different substrates with the corresponding data for several gdos and the docking of salicylates gentisates in the active site of sdo allowed the identification of several active site residues responsible for differences of substrate specificity in particular a more defined electron density of the n terminal region allowed the discovery of a novel structure fragment in sdo previously unobserved in gdo this region contributes several residues to the active site that influence substrate specificity for both of these enzymes implications on the catalytic mechanism are discussed
