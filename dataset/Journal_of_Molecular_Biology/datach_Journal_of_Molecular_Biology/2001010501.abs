nmr structure of streptomyces killer toxin like protein sklp further evidence for the wide distribution of single domain   crystallin superfamily proteins edited by p wright
a protein isolated from the culture supernatant of the soil bacterium streptomyces sp f   exhibits cytocidal effects for both budding and fission yeasts and causes morphological changes of yeasts and filamentous fungi this protein which was the first killer toxin like protein for yeasts identified in the streptomyces microorganism was named sklp streptomyces killer toxin like protein  since the amino acid sequence of the protein as determined by sequential edman degradations seemed to be unique we determined the structure by nmr spectroscopy although the actual target of sklp in yeasts has not been determined yet the structure might give us a clue to characterize the targets the solution structure of sklp determined by nmr however turned out to be a single domain crystallin like protein with two greek key motifs and a short extra  strand at the n terminus the final ensemble of  nmr structures overlaid onto their mean coordinate with rmsd values of         for the backbone atoms involved in the secondary structure elements as a yeast killer toxin wmkt isolated from the yeast strain williopsis mrakii also has a greek key  barrel fold we have made a detailed comparison of the structural features of sklp with the other crystallin superfamily proteins it is very interesting that sklp has a unique electrostatic potential distribution on the molecular surface namely one surface of the  barrel fold in sklp has a large negatively charged region with an isolated positive charge of the arg  side chain at the center the edge of this surface is surrounded by positively charged residues including arg  arg  and arg  the salient features of the charge distribution on this surface and the cluster of arg residues might be related to the target binding of sklp
