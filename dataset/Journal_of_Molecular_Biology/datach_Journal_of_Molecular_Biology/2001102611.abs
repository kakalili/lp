microglobulin and its deamidated variant n d form amyloid fibrils with a range of morphologies in vitro edited by j thornton
amyloid fibrils formed by incubation of recombinant wild type human   microglobulin   m ab initio in vitro at low ph and high ionic strength are short and highly curved by contrast fibrils extracted from patients suffering from haemodialysis related amyloidosis and those formed by seeding growth of the wild type protein in vitro with fibrils ex vivo are longer and straighter than those previously produced ab initio in vitro here we explore the effect of growth conditions on morphology of  m fibrils formed ab initio in vitro from the wild type protein as well as a variant form of  m in which asn  is deamidated to asp n d  we show that deamidation results in significant destabilisation of  m at neutral ph despite this acidification is still necessary to form amyloid from the mutant protein in vitro interestingly at low ph and low ionic strength long straight fibrils of recombinant  m are formed in vitro the fibrils comprise three distinct morphological types when examined using electron microscopy em and atomic force microscopy afm that vary in periodicity and the number of constituent protofibrils using kinetic experiments we suggest that the immature fibrils observed previously do not represent intermediates in the assembly of fully mature amyloid at least under the conditions studied here
