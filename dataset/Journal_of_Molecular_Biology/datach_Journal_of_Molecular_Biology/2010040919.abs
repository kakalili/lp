crystal structure and catalytic mechanism of leucoanthocyanidin reductase from vitis vinifera
leucoanthocyanidin reductase lar catalyzes the nadph dependent reduction of r s s flavan   diols into r s flavan  ols a subfamily of flavonoids that is important for plant survival and for human nutrition lar from vitis vinifera has been co crystallized with or without nadph and one of its natural products   catechin crystals diffract to a resolution between   and      the coenzyme and substrate binding pocket is preformed in the apoprotein and not markedly altered upon nadph binding the structure of the abortive ternary complex determined at a resolution of      indicates the ordering of a short   helix associated with substrate binding and suggests that his  and lys  act as acid  base catalysts based on our d structures a two step catalytic mechanism is proposed in which a concerted dehydration precedes an nadph mediated hydride transfer at c  the dehydration step involves a lys catalyzed deprotonation of the phenolic oh through a bridging water molecule and a his catalyzed protonation of the benzylic hydroxyl at c  the resulting quinone methide serves as an electrophilic target for hydride transfer at c  lar belongs to the short chain dehydrogenase reductase superfamily and to the pip pinoresinol  lariciresinol reductase isoflavone reductase and phenylcoumaran benzylic ether reductase family our data support the concept that all pip enzymes reduce a quinone methide intermediate and that the major role of the only residue that has been conserved from the short chain dehydrogenase reductase catalytic triad ser  tyrxxxlys  that is lysine is to promote the formation of this intermediate by catalyzing the deprotonation of a phenolic hydroxyl for some pip enzymes this lysine catalyzed proton abstraction may be sufficient to trigger the extrusion of the leaving group whereas in lar the extrusion of a hydroxide group requires a more sophisticated mechanism of concerted acid  base catalysis that involves histidine and takes advantage of the oh  oh  and oh substituents of leucoanthocyanidins
