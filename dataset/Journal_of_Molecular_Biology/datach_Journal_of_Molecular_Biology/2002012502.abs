protein protein interactions of hcsl p with other human exosome subunits edited by j karn
the exosome is a complex of        exoribonucleases which functions in a variety of cellular processes all requiring the processing or degradation of rna we demonstrate that the two human proteins hcsl p and hrrp p which have been identified on the basis of their sequence homology with saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins are associated with the human exosome by mammalian two hybrid and gst pull down assays we show that the hcsl p protein interacts directly with two other exosome proteins hrrp p and hrrp p mutants of hcsl p that fail to interact with either hrrp p or hrrp p are also not able to associate with exosome complexes in vivo these results indicate that the association of hcsl p with the exosome is mediated by protein protein interactions with hrrp p and hrrp p
