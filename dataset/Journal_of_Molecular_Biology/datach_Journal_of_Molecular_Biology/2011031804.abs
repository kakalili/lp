structural investigation of psbo from plant and cyanobacterial photosystem ii
the manganese stabilizing protein psbo is associated with the luminal side of thylakoids close to the redox active mn ca cluster at the catalytically active site of photosystem ii psii  psbo is believed to increase the efficiency of oxygen evolution and to stabilize the mn ca cluster against photoinhibition using small angle x ray scattering we investigated the low resolution structure of wild type spinach psbo and that of chimeric spinach psbo fused with maltose binding protein small angle x ray scattering data revealed that both proteins are monomeric in solution and that plant and cyanobacterial psbo have similar structures we show a highly efficient expression system that allows recombinant production of the active wild type and the chimeric psbo from spinach and cyanobacteria with yields compatible with biophysical and structural studies the binding of spinach psbo fused with maltose binding protein to psii depleted of extrinsic subunits psii  psbo p q was confirmed by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry the reconstituted psii was shown to have similar oxygen evolution rates as obtained with wild type spinach psbo
