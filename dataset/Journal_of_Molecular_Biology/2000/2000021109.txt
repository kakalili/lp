A self-consistent theory is presented that can be used to estimate the number and composition of sequences satisfying a predetermined set of constraints. The theory is formulated so as to examine the features of sequences having a particular value of Δ = Ef − 〈E〉u, where Ef is the energy of sequences when in a target structure and 〈E〉u is an average energy of non-target structures. The theory yields the probabilities wi(α) that each position i in the sequence is occupied by a particular monomer type α. The theory is applied to a simple lattice model of proteins. Excellent agreement is observed between the theory and the results of exact enumerations. The theory provides a quantitative framework for the design and interpretation of combinatorial experiments involving proteins, where a library of amino acid sequences is searched for sequences that fold to a desired structure.
