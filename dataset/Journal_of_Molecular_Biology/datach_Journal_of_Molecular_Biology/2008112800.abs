high affinity ni  binding selectively promotes binding of helicobacter pylori nikr to its target urease promoter
nikr is a prokaryotic transcription factor that regulates the expression of ni  enzymes and other proteins involved in ni  trafficking in the human pathogen helicobacter pylori nikr controls transcription of the ni  enzyme urease which allows survival of the bacterium in the acidic gastric niche the in vitro affinity of nikr from h pylori hpnikr for different metal ions and the metal ion dependent capability of hpnikr to bind purea the promoter of the urease operon were the object of this study electrophoretic mobility shift and dnase i footprinting assays indicated that ni  is necessary and sufficient to promote hpnikr binding to purea while the effect of other metal ions in identical conditions is significantly lower zn  and co  or absent ca  and mg   isothermal titration calorimetry itc demonstrated the absence of specific ca  and mg  binding to the protein itc also established the binding of zn  and co  to two sets of high affinity sites on hpnikr differing in stoichiometry n   n   and dissociation constant kd   nm kd   nm for zn  kd     m kd     m for co   additional low affinity binding sites were observed for zn  n  kd    m  mobility shift assays and itc proved that binding of stoichiometric ni  but not zn  or co  to the high affinity sites but not to the low affinity sites selectively activates hpnikr to bind its target operator with   stoichiometry and kd   nm a protein conformational rearrangement is selectively induced by ni  and not by zn  as indicated by fluorescence spectroscopy and microcalorimetry accordingly competition experiments showed that stoichiometric ni  outperforms zn  as well as co  in functionally activating hpnikr toward high affinity binding to purea a general scheme for the nickel selective hpnikr  dna interaction is proposed
