improving coiled coil stability by optimizing ionic interactions
helical coiled coils are a common protein oligomerization motif stabilized mainly by hydrophobic interactions occurring along the coiled coil interface we have recently designed and solved the structure of a two heptad repeat coiled coil peptide that is stabilized further by a complex network of inter and intrahelical salt bridges in addition to the hydrophobic interactions here we extend and improve the de novo design of this two heptad repeat peptide by four newly designed peptides characterized by different types of ionic interactions the contribution of these different types of ionic interactions to coiled coil stability are analyzed by cd spectroscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation we show that all peptides are highly  helical and two of them are   dimeric under physiological conditions furthermore we have solved the x ray structure of the most stable of these peptides and the rational design principles are verified by comparing this structure to the structure of the parent peptide we show that by combining the most favorable inter and intrahelical salt bridge arrangements it is possible to design coiled coil oligomerization domains with improved stability properties
