using reaction mechanism to measure enzyme similarity
the concept of reaction similarity has been well studied in terms of the overall transformation associated with a reaction but not in terms of mechanism we present the first method to give a quantitative measure of the similarity of reactions based upon their explicit mechanisms two approaches are presented to measure the similarity between individual steps of mechanisms a fingerprint based approach that incorporates relevant information on each mechanistic step and an approach based only on bond formation cleavage and changes in order the overall similarity for two reaction mechanisms is then calculated using the needleman  wunsch alignment algorithm an analysis of macie a database of enzyme mechanisms using our measure of similarity identifies some examples of convergent evolution of chemical mechanisms in many cases mechanism similarity is not reflected by similarity according to the ec system of enzyme classification in particular little mechanistic information is conveyed by the class level of the ec system
