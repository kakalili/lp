The αvβ6 integrin is a promising target for cancer therapy. Its expression is up-regulated de novo on many types of carcinoma where it may activate transforming growth factor-β1 and transforming growth factor-β3, interact with the specific extracellular matrix proteins and promote migration and invasion of tumor cells. The viral protein 1 (VP1) coat protein of the O1 British field strain serotype of foot-and-mouth disease virus is a high-affinity ligand for αvβ6, and we recently reported that a peptide derived from VP1 exhibited αvβ6-specific binding in vitro and in vivo. We hypothesized that this peptide could confer binding specificity of an antibody to αvβ6. A 17-mer peptide of VP1 was inserted into the complementarity-determining region H3 loop of MFE-23, a murine single-chain Fv (scFv) antibody reactive with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The resultant scFv (B6-1) bound to αvβ6 but retained residual reactivity with CEA. This was eliminated by point mutation (Y100bP) in the variable heavy-chain domain to create an scFv (B6-2) that was as structurally stable as MFE-23 and reacted specifically with αvβ6 but not with α5β1, αvβ3, αvβ5, αvβ8 or CEA. B6-2 was internalized into αvβ6-expressing cells and inhibited αvβ6-dependent migration of carcinoma cells. B6-2 was subsequently humanized. The humanized form (B6-3) was obtained as a non-covalent dimer from secretion in Pichia pastoris (115 mg/l) and was a potent inhibitor of αvβ6-mediated cell adhesion. Thus, we have used a rational stepwise approach to create a humanized scFv with therapeutic potential to block αvβ6-mediated cancer cell invasion or to deliver and internalize toxins specifically to αvβ6-expressing tumors.
