conformational analysis of strh the surface attached exo  d n acetylglucosaminidase from streptococcus pneumoniae
streptococcus pneumoniae is a serious human pathogen that presents on its surface numerous proteins involved in the host  bacterium interaction the carbohydrate active enzymes are particularly well represented among these surface proteins and many of these are known virulence factors highlighting the importance of carbohydrate processing by this pathogen strh is a surface attached exo  d n acetylglucosaminidase that cooperates with the sialidase nana and the  galactosidase bgaa to sequentially degrade the nonreducing terminal arms of complex n linked glycans this enzyme is a large multi modular protein that is notable for its tandem n terminal family gh  catalytic modules whose individual x ray crystal structures were recently reported strh also contains c terminal tandem g modules which are uncharacterized here we report the nmr determined solution structure of the first g module in the tandem g   which along with the x ray crystal structures of the gh  modules was used in conjunction with small angle x ray scattering to construct a pseudo atomic model of full length strh the results reveal a model in which strh adopts an elongated conformation that may project the catalytic modules away from the surface of the bacterium to a distance of up to
