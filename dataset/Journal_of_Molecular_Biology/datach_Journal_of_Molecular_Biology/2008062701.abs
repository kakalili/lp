the s to r transition of corticosteroid binding globulin and the mechanism of hormone release
corticosteroids are transported in the blood by a serpin corticosteroid binding globulin cbg  and their normally equilibrated release can be further triggered by the cleavage of the reactive loop of cbg we report here the crystal structures of cleaved human cbg ccbg at    resolution and its complex with cortisol at    resolution as expected on cleavage cbg undergoes the irreversible s to r serpin transition with the cleaved reactive loops being fully incorporated into the central  sheet a connecting loop of helix d which is in a helix like conformation in native cbg unwinds and grossly perturbs the hormone binding site following  sheet expansion in the ccbg structure but shifts away from the binding site by more than    following the binding of cortisol unexpectedly on cortisol binding the hormone binding site of ccbg adopts a configuration almost identical with that of the native conformer we conclude that cbg has adapted an allosteric mechanism of the serpins to allow equilibrated release of the hormones by a flip  flop movement of the intact reactive loop into and out of the  sheet the change in the hormone binding affinity results from a change in the flexibility or plasticity of the connecting loop which modulates the configuration of the binding site
