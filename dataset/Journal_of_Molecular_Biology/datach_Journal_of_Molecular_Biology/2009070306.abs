expression of pit  in nonsomatotrope cell lines induces human growth hormone locus control region histone modification and hgh n transcription
the pou domain transcription factor pit  is expressed in somatotropes lactotropes and thyrotropes of the anterior pituitary pit  is essential for the establishment of these lineages during development and regulates the expression of genes encoding the peptide hormones secreted by each cell type including the growth hormone gene expressed in somatotropes in contrast to rodent growth hormone loci the human growth hormone hgh locus is regulated by a distal locus control region lcr  which is required in cis for the proper expression of the hgh gene cluster in transgenic mice the hgh lcr mediates a domain of histone acetylation targeted to the hgh locus that is associated with distal hgh n activation and the discrete determinants of this activity coincide with dnasei hypersensitive site hs i of the lcr the identification of three in vitro pit  binding sites within the hs i region suggested a model in which pit  binding at hs i initiates the chromatin modification mechanism associated with hgh lcr activity to test this hypothesis directly and to determine whether pit  expression is sufficient to confer hgh locus histone acetylation and activate hgh n transcription from an inactive locus we expressed pit  in nonpituitary cell types we show that pit  expression established a domain of histone hyperacetylation at the lcr and hgh n promoter in these cells similar to that observed in pituitary chromatin this was accompanied by the activation of hgh n transcription and an increase in intergenic and cd b transcripts proximal to hs i these effects were coincident with pit  occupancy at hs i and the hgh n promoter and were observed irrespective of the basal histone modification status of hs i in the heterologous cell line these findings are consistent with a role for pit  as an initiating factor in hgh locus activation during somatotrope ontogeny acting through binding sites at hs i of the hgh lcr
