The genome of the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 contains at least four types of short sequence elements lacking open reading frames which are similar to eukaryal non-autonomous mobile elements. The most- conserved elements SM1 (79–80 bp) and SM2 (183–186 bp), with 95 % sequence identity, are present in 40 and 25 copies, respectively. The less-conserved elements SM3 (127–139 bp) and SM4 (160–168 bp), with 75–97 % identity, occur in 44 and 34 copies, respectively. In total, the 143 SM elements constitute about 0.6 % of the genome. The wide distribution of each class of conserved element throughout the genome, and their precise locations, indicate that they are mobile. Direct evidence arises from the presence of SM1 and SM2 in only a fraction of genomic copies of a given class of insertion element, and within copies of open reading frames that are conserved in sequence. SM1 to SM4 are likely to be mobilized by transposases encoded by insertion elements ISC1048, ISC1217, ISC1058 and ISC1173, respectively. Furthermore, the occurrence of clusters of interwoven SM and insertion elements, in potentially mobile units, suggests a mechanism for the transfer of SM elements to other organisms.
