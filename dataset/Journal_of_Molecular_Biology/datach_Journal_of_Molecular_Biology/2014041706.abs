a novel c terminal homologue of aha co chaperone binds to heat shock protein  and stimulates its atpase activity in entamoeba histolytica
cytosolic heat shock protein   hsp  has been shown to be essential for many infectious pathogens and is considered a potential target for drug development in this study we have carried out biochemical characterization of hsp  from a poorly studied protozoan parasite of clinical importance entamoeba histolytica we have shown that entamoeba hsp  can bind to both atp and its pharmacological inhibitor   aag   allylamino  demethoxygeldanamycin  with kd values of    and    m respectively and it has a weak atpase activity with a catalytic efficiency of       min   m   using inhibitor  aag we have shown dependence of entamoeba on hsp  for its growth and survival hsp  function is regulated by various co chaperones previous studies suggest a lack of several important co chaperones in e histolytica in this study we describe the presence of a novel homologue of co chaperone aha  activator of hsp  atpase  ehaha c lacking a canonical aha n terminal domain we also show that ehaha c is capable of binding and stimulating atpase activity of ehhsp  in addition to highlighting the potential of hsp  inhibitors as drugs against amoebiasis our study highlights the importance of e histolytica in understanding the evolution of hsp  and its co chaperone repertoire
