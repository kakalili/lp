structure of a ca  cam kv   kcnq  b helix complex provides insight into m current modulation
calmodulin cam is an important regulator of kv x kcnqx voltage gated potassium channels channels from this family produce neuronal m currents and cardiac and auditory iks currents and harbor mutations that cause arrhythmias epilepsy and deafness despite extensive functional characterization biochemical and structural details of the interaction between cam and the channel have remained elusive here we show that both apo cam and ca  cam bind to the c terminal tail of the neuronal channel kv   kcnq  which is involved in both hearing and mechanosensation interactions between apo cam and the kv  tail involve two c terminal tail segments known as the a and b segments whereas the interaction between ca  cam and the kv  c terminal tail requires only the b segment biochemical studies show that the calcium dependence of the cam b segment interaction is conserved in all kv subtypes x ray crystallographic determination of the structure of the ca  cam kv  b segment complex shows that ca  cam wraps around the kv  b segment which forms an  helix in an antiparallel orientation that embodies a variation of the classic   ca  cam interaction motif taken together with the context of prior studies our data suggest a model for modulation of neuronal kv channels involving a calcium dependent conformational switch from an apo cam form that bridges the a and b segments to a ca  cam form bound to the b helix the structure presented here also provides a context for a number of disease causing mutations and for further dissection of the mechanisms by which cam controls kv function
