ca  dependent photocrosslinking of tropomyosin residue   to residues      in the c terminal domain of troponin i in reconstituted skeletal muscle thin filaments
the ca  dependent interaction of troponin i tni with actin tropomyosin tm in muscle thin filaments is a critical step in the regulation of muscle contraction previous studies have suggested that in the absence of ca  tni interacts with tm and actin in reconstituted muscle thin filaments maintaining tm at the outer domain of actin and blocking myosin  actin interaction to obtain direct evidence for this tm  tni interaction we performed photochemical crosslinking studies using tm labeled with  maleimidobenzophenone at position   or   tm   or tm   respectively  reconstituted with actin and troponin composed of tni troponin t tnt  and troponin c or with actin and tni after near uv irradiation sds gels of the tm   containing thin filament showed three new high molecular weight bands determined to be crosslinked products tm    tni tm    troponin c and tm    tnt using fluorescence labeled tni mass spectrometry and western blot analysis while tm    tni was produced only in the absence of ca  the production of other crosslinked species did not show ca  dependence tm   mainly crosslinked to tnt in the absence of actin a similar crosslinking pattern was obtained with a much lower yield a tryptic peptide from tm    tni with a molecular mass of     da that was not present in the tryptic peptides of tm   or tni was identified using hplc and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight this was shown using absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy to be the  maleimidobenzophenone labeled peptide from tm crosslinked to tni peptide      these data which show that a region in the c terminal domain of tni interacts with tm in the absence of ca  support the hypothesis that a tni  tm interaction maintains tm at the outer domain of actin and will help efforts to localize troponin in actin tm muscle thin filaments
