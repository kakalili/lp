conformational changes during the assembly of factor b from its domains by h nmr spectroscopy and molecular modelling their relevance to the regulation of factor b activity edited by r huber
factor b is a key component of the alternative pathway of complement and is cleaved by factor d into the ba and bb fragments in the presence of activated c  c b or c h o  the ba fragment contains three short consensus complement repeat domains while the bb fragment contains a von willebrand factor type a vwf a domain and a serine protease sp domain all three of which are implicated in multisite contacts with c  the upfield shifted signals in the h nmr spectra of factor b the ba and bb fragments and the vwf a and sp domains were used as sensitive conformational probes of their structures temperature studies and ph titrations showed that the ba fragment and the vwf a and sp domains had conformationally mobile structures the comparison of the nmr spectra of the sp domains of both factor b and factor d showed that the factor d linewidths were broader than those for factor b which may result from a range of proteolytically inactive conformations of factor d in the absence of substrate the nmr spectra from the separate vwf a and sp domains in combination with that of the ba fragment generally accounted for that of intact factor b apart from the perturbation of an upfield shifted signal from the ba fragment a new upfield shifted signal was observed in the bb fragment that was not detected in the spectra for the vwf a or sp domains or intact factor b ring current calculations based on homology models or crystal structures predicted that buried hydrophobic methyl aromatic interactions probably accounted for the upfield shifted signals with many arising from the n terminal subdomain of the sp domain to which the c terminus of the vwf a domain is directly linked it was concluded that   the conformation of the free sp domain is better ordered in solution than that of factor d   the conformation of the ba fragment is affected by its incorporation into factor b and   the proximity of the vwf a and sp domains within the bb fragment leads to a conformational change in which conserved charged residues may be important allosteric structural rearrangements in the sp domain as the result of its interactions with the vwf a domain or the ba fragment provide an explanation of the regulation of the catalytic activity of factor b
