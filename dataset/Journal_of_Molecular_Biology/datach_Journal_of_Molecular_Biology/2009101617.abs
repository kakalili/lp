the role of prefibrillar structures in the assembly of a peptide amyloid
the self assembly of proteins into stable fibrillar aggregates is a general property of polypeptides most notably associated with degenerative diseases termed amyloidoses these nano to micrometer scale structures are formed predominantly of  sheets that self assemble by a nucleation dependent mechanism the rate limiting step of assembly involves stabilization of high energy intermediates in a kinetic step termed nucleation determination of the structural characteristics of these high energy intermediates has been elusive as its members are the least populated states on the assembly pathway using a peptide derived from diabetes related amyloid we use electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectroscopy and disulfide crosslinking to show that fibers are composed of parallel in register  sheets kinetic studies are then used to infer the structural elements of the pre nucleation intermediates notably stabilization of this ensemble is shown to depend on the number but not the position of amide side chains within the primary sequence additionally fiber formation is accelerated by constructs that mimic the intra sheet structure of the fiber our data suggest that pre nucleation intermediates sample intra   sheet structure and place bounds on the possible nucleation mechanisms for fiber assembly understanding the nucleation of fibrillogenesis is critical so that this process can be prevented in disease and productively controlled by design
