solution structure of a dna double helix incorporating four consecutive non watson crick base pairs edited by i tinoco
a series of dna  mers containing a variety of the    internal loop sequence   caag      acgt   were studied using nuclear magnetic resonance nmr methodology and distance geometry dg molecular dynamics md approaches such oligomers exhibit excellent resolution in the nmr spectra and reveal many unusual noes nuclear overhauser effect that allow for the detailed characterization of a dna hairpin incorporating a track of four different non watson crick base pairs in the stem these include a wobble c a base pair a sheared a c base pair a sheared a g base pair and a wobble g t base pair significantly different twisting angles were observed between the base pairs in internal loop that results with excellent intra strand and inter strand base stacking within the four consecutive mismatches and the surrounding canonical base pairs this explains why it melts at   c even though five out of ten base pairs in the stem adopt non watson crick pairs however the    internal loop still fits into a b dna double helix very well without significant change in the backbone torsion angles only  torsion angles between the tandem sheared base pairs are changed to a great extent from the gauche  domain to the trans domain to accommodate the cross strand base stacking in the internal loop the observation that several consecutive non canonical base pairs can stably co exist with watson crick base pairs greatly increases the limited repertoire of irregular dna folds and reveals the possibility for unusual structural formation in the functionally important genomic regions that have potential to become single stranded
