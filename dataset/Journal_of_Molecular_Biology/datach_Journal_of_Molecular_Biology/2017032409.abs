the sequence of nucleosomal dna modulates sliding by the chd chromatin remodeler
chromatin remodelers are atp dependent enzymes that are critical for reorganizing and repositioning nucleosomes in concert with many basic cellular processes for the chromodomain helicase dna binding protein  chd  remodeler nucleosome sliding has been shown to depend on the dna flanking the nucleosome transcription factor binding at the nucleosome edge and the presence of the histone h a h b dimer on the entry side here we report that chd is also sensitive to the sequence of dna within the nucleosome and slides nucleosomes made with the   widom positioning sequence asymmetrically kinetic and equilibrium experiments show that poly da dt tracts perturb remodeling reactions if within one and a half helical turns of superhelix location  shl  where the chd atpase engages nucleosomal dna these sequence dependent effects do not rely on the chd dna binding domain and are not due to differences in nucleosome affinity using site specific cross linking we show that internal poly da dt tracts do not block the engagement of the atpase motor with shl  yet they promote multiple translational positions of dna with respect to both chd and the histone core we speculate that chd senses the sequence dependent response of dna as the remodeler atpase perturbs the duplex at shl  these results suggest that the sequence sensitivity of histones and remodelers occur at unique segments of dna on the nucleosome allowing them to work together or in opposition to determine nucleosome positions throughout the genome
