anatomy of a preferred target site for the bacterial insertion sequence is   edited by m gottesman
like many transposons the bacterial insertion sequence is  was thought to insert randomly however using both genetic and statistical approaches we have derived a target site for is  that is used   of the time computational and genetic analyses of multiple is  insertion sites predicted a preferred target consisting of a  bp palindromic pattern centered on the  bp target duplication generated during transposition here we show that targeting can be dissected into four components the  bp flanking sequences the most important sequences required for site specific insertion the  bp palindromic core within the target duplication the dinucleotide pair at the transposon target junction and the local dna context finally using a substrate with multiple target sites we show that a target site is more likely found by a local bind and slide model and not by extended dna tracking
