very high resolution structure of a trematode hemoglobin displaying a tyrb  tyre heme distal residue pair and high oxygen affinity edited by k nagai
monomeric hemoglobin from the trematode paramphistomum epiclitum displays very high oxygen affinity p  lt    mm hg and an unusual heme distal site containing tyrosyl residues at the b  and e positions the crystal structure of aquo met p epiclitum hemoglobin solved at     resolution via multiwavelength anomalous dispersion techniques r factor      shows that the heme distal site pocket residue tyrb  is engaged in hydrogen bonding to the iron bound ligand by contrast residue tyre is unexpectedly locked next to the cd globin region in a conformation unsuitable for heme bound ligand stabilisation such structural organization of the e distal residue differs strikingly from that observed in the nematode ascaris suum hemoglobin bearing tyrb  and glne residues  which also displays very high oxygen affinity the oxygenation and carbonylation parameters of wild type p epiclitum hb as well as of single and double site mutants with residue substitutions at positions b  e and e  have been determined and are discussed here in the light of the protein atomic resolution crystal structure
