membrane integration characteristics of two abc transporters cftr and p glycoprotein
to what extent do corresponding transmembrane helices in related integral membrane proteins have different membrane insertion characteristics here we compare side by side the membrane insertion characteristics of the  transmembrane helices in the adenosine triphosphate binding cassette abc transporters p glycoprotein p gp and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator cftr  our results show that  of the  cftr transmembrane segments can insert independently into the er membrane in contrast only three of the p gp transmembrane segments are independently stable in the membrane while the majority depend on the presence of neighboring loops and or transmembrane segments for efficient insertion membrane insertion characteristics can thus vary widely between related proteins
