dodecin sequesters fad in closed conformation from the aqueous solution
both extensive theoretical calculations and experimental data obtained during several decades leave little doubt that flavin adenine dinucleotide fad exists in an open as well as in a closed conformation in aqueous solution however the knowledge about the intramolecularly stacked complex of fad is constructed on indirect methods while direct structural evidence is lacking recently dodecin was reported as an unspecific flavin binding protein which exhibits the unique binding mode of incorporating stacked dimers of flavins into a single binding pocket here we show that fad is not bound in this manner but in monomers of intramolecularly stacked conformation as resulting from the dodecin ligand binding characteristic this fad stacked conformation suggests to be directly sequestered from the aqueous solution and thus to be the first x ray structural view on a fad solution stacked form moreover in extraordinary fad binding dodecin serves as a model for studying bound monomeric fad versus bound dimeric e g riboflavin flavin properties
