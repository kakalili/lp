structural and biochemical investigations of the catalytic mechanism of an nadp dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase from streptococcus mutans edited by i a wilson
the nadp dependent non phosphorylating glyceraldehyde  phosphate dehydrogenase from streptococcus mutans abbreviated sm aldh belongs to the aldehyde dehydrogenase aldh family its catalytic mechanism proceeds via two steps acylation and deacylation its high catalytic efficiency at neutral ph implies prerequisites relative to the chemical mechanism first the catalytic cys  should be accessible and in a thiolate form at physiological ph to attack efficiently the aldehydic group of the glyceraldehyde  phosphate g p  second the hydride transfer from the hemithioacetal intermediate toward the nicotinamide ring of nadp should be efficient third the nucleophilic character of the water molecule involved in the deacylation should be strongly increased moreover the different complexes formed during the catalytic process should be stabilised the crystal structures presented here an apoenzyme named apo with two sulphate ions bound to the catalytic site the c  s mutant holoenzyme and the ternary complex composed of the c  s holoenzyme and g p together with biochemical results and previously published apo and holo crystal structures named apo and holo  respectively contribute to the understanding of the aldh catalytic mechanism comparison of apo and holo crystal structures shows a cys  side chain rotation of    upon cofactor binding which is probably responsible for its p ka decrease in the apo structure an oxygen atom of a sulphate anion interacts by hydrogen bonds with the nh group of a conserved asparagine residue asn  in sm aldh and the cys  nh group in the ternary complex the oxygen atom of the aldehydic carbonyl group of the substrate interacts with the ser  nh group and the asn  nh group a substrate isotope effect on acylation is observed for both the wild type and the n  a and n  t mutants the rate of the acylation step strongly decreases for the mutants and becomes limiting all these results suggest the involvement of asn  in an oxyanion hole in order to stabilise the tetrahedral intermediate and likely the other intermediates of the reaction in the ternary complex the cofactor conformation is shifted in comparison with its conformation in the c  s holoenzyme structure likely resulting from its peculiar binding mode to the rossmann fold i e non perpendicular to the plane of the  sheet  this change is likely favoured by a characteristic loop of the rossmann fold longer in aldhs than in other dehydrogenases whose orientation could be constrained by a conserved proline residue in the ternary and c  s holenzyme structures as well as in the apo structure the glu  side chain is situated less than   from cys  or ser  instead of   in the crystal structure of the wild type holoenzyme it is now positioned in a hydrophobic environment this supports the p ka assignment of   to glu  as recently proposed from enzymatic studies
