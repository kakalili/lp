bip and its nucleotide exchange factors grp  and sil  mechanisms of action and biological functions
bip immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein is the endoplasmic reticulum er orthologue of the hsp  family of molecular chaperones and is intricately involved in most functions of this organelle through its interactions with a variety of substrates and regulatory proteins like all hsp  family members the ability of bip to bind and release unfolded proteins is tightly regulated by a cycle of atp binding hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange as a characteristic of the hsp  family multiple dnaj like co factors can target substrates to bip and stimulate its atpase activity to stabilize the binding of bip to substrates however only in the past decade have nucleotide exchange factors for bip been identified which has shed light not only on the mechanism of bip assisted folding in the er but also on hsp  family members that reside throughout the cell we will review the current understanding of the atpase cycle of bip in the unique environment of the er and how it is regulated by the nucleotide exchange factors grp   glucose regulated protein of  kda and sil  both of which perform unanticipated roles in various biological functions and disease states
