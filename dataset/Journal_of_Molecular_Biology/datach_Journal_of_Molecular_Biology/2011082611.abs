structured regions of  synuclein fibrils include the early onset parkinson s disease mutation sites
synuclein as fibrils are the major component of lewy bodies the pathological hallmark of parkinson s disease pd  here we use results from an extensive investigation employing solid state nmr to present a detailed structural characterization and conformational dynamics quantification of full length as fibrils our results show that the core extends with a repeated structural motif this result disagrees with the previously proposed fold of as fibrils obtained with limited solid state nmr data additionally our results demonstrate that the three single point mutations associated with early onset pd  a p e k and a t  are located in structured regions we find that e k and a t mutations located in rigid  strands of the wild type fibrils are associated with major and minor structural perturbations respectively
