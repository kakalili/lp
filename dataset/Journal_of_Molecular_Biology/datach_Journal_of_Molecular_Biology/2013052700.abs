probing the electrostatics and pharmacological modulation of sequence specific binding by the dna binding domain of the ets family transcription factor pu  a binding affinity and kinetics investigation
members of the ets family of transcription factors regulate a functionally diverse array of genes all ets proteins share a structurally conserved but sequence divergent dna binding domain known as the ets domain although the structure and thermodynamics of the ets  dna complexes are well known little is known about the kinetics of sequence recognition a facet that offers potential insight into its molecular mechanism we have characterized dna binding by the ets domain of pu  by biosensor surface plasmon resonance spr  spr analysis revealed a striking kinetic profile for dna binding by the pu  ets domain at low salt concentrations it binds high affinity cognate dna with a very slow association rate constant    m  s    compensated by a correspondingly small dissociation rate constant the kinetics are strongly salt dependent but mutually balance to produce a relatively weak dependence in the equilibrium constant this profile contrasts sharply with reported data for other ets domains e g  ets  tel for which high affinity binding is driven by rapid association  gt  m  s    we interpret this difference in terms of the hydration properties of ets  dna binding and propose that at least two mechanisms of sequence recognition are employed by this family of dna binding domain additionally we use spr to demonstrate the potential for pharmacological inhibition of sequence specific ets  dna binding using the minor groove binding distamycin as a model compound our work establishes spr as a valuable technique for extending our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of ets  dna interactions as well as developing potential small molecule agents for biotechnological and therapeutic purposes
