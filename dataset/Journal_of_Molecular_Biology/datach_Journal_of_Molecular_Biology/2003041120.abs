drosophila proteasome regulator reg  transcriptional activation by dna replication related factor dref and evidence for a role in cell cycle progression
the proteasome regulator reg pa   is a conserved complex present in metazoan nuclei and is able to stimulate the trypsin like activity of the proteasome in a non atp dependent manner however the in vivo function for reg  in metazoan cells is currently unknown to understand the role of drosophila reg  we have attempted to identify the type of promoter elements regulating its transcription mapping the site of the transcription initiation revealed a tata less promoter and a sequence search identified elements found typically in drosophila genes involved in cell cycle progression and dna replication in order to test the relevance of the motifs reg  transcriptional assays were carried out with mutations in the proposed promoter our results indicate that a single drosophila replication related element sequence dre is essential for reg  transcription to confirm that reg  has a role in cell cycle progression the effect of removing reg  from s cells was tested using rna interference drosophila cells depleted of reg  showed partial arrests in g s cell cycle transition immuno staining of drosophila embryos revealed that reg  is typically localized to the nucleus during embryogenesis with increased levels present in invaginating cells during gastrulation the reg  was found dispersed throughout the cell volume within mitotic domains undergoing cell division finally database searches suggest that the dre system may regulate key members of the proteasome system in drosophila
