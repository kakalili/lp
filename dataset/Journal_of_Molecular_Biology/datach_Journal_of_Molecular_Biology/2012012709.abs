analysis of the active site mechanism of tyrosyl dna phosphodiesterase i a member of the phospholipase d superfamily
tyrosyl dna phosphodiesterase i tdp  is a member of the phospholipase d superfamily that hydrolyzes   phospho dna adducts via two conserved catalytic histidines  one acting as the lead nucleophile and the second acting as a general acid base substitution of the second histidine specifically to arginine contributes to the neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy scan  we investigated the catalytic role of this histidine in the yeast protein his   using a combination of x ray crystallography biochemistry yeast genetics and theoretical chemistry the structures of wild type tdp and his  arg both show a phosphorylated form of the nucleophilic histidine that is not observed in the structure of his  asn the phosphohistidine is stabilized in the his  arg structure by the guanidinium group that also restricts the access of nucleophilic water molecule to the tdp  dna intermediate biochemical analyses confirm that his  arg forms an observable and unique tdp  dna adduct during catalysis substitution of his  by lys does not affect catalytic activity or yeast phenotype but substitutions with asn gln leu ala ser and thr all result in severely compromised enzymes and dna topoisomerase i camptothecin dependent lethality surprisingly his  asn did not show a stable covalent tdp  dna intermediate that suggests another catalytic defect theoretical calculations revealed that the defect resides in the nucleophilic histidine and that the pka of this histidine is crucially dependent on the second histidine and on the incoming phosphate of the substrate this represents a unique example of substrate activated catalysis that applies to the entire phospholipase d superfamily
