mapping of the lipid binding and stability properties of the central rod domain of human dystrophin
dystrophin is a cytoskeletal protein that confers resistance to the sarcolemma against the stress of contraction  relaxation cycles by interacting with cytoskeletal and membrane partners apart from several proteins membrane phospholipids are a partner of the central rod domain made up of  spectrin like repeats separated into sub domains by four hinges we previously showed that repeats  to  bind to membrane anionic phospholipids while repeats  to  are not able to do so we focus here on the phospholipid binding properties of the major part of the central rod domain namely the sub domain delineated by hinges  and  comprising  repeats ranging from repeat  to   r     we designed and produced multirepeat proteins comprising three to five repeats and report their lipid binding properties as well as their thermal stabilities when these proteins are mixed with liposomes including the anionic lipid phosphatidylserine they form stable protein  vesicle complexes as determined by gel filtration chromatography the absence of an anionic lipid precludes the formation of such complexes spectroscopic analyses by circular dichroism and tryptophan fluorescence show that while the  helical secondary structures are not modified by the binding protein trans conformation leads to the movement of tryptophan residues into more hydrophobic environments in addition the decrease in the molar ellipticity ratio at     nm as observed by circular dichroism indicates that lipid binding reduces the inter helical interactions of multirepeat proteins thus suggesting partly  opened  coiled coil structures combining these results with data from our previous studies we propose a new model of the dystrophin molecule lying along the membrane bilayer in which the two sub domains r   and r    interact with lipids and f actin while the distal sub domain r    does not exhibit any interaction these lipid binding domains should thus maintain a structural link between cytoskeletal actin and sarcolemma via the membrane phospholipids
