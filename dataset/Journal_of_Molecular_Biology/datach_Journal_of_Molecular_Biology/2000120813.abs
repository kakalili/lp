phage display screening reveals an association between germline specific transcription factor oct  and multiple cellular proteins
oct  is a transcription factor that is specifically expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells and in cell lines derived thereof in these cells oct  activates transcription from remote binding sites due to as of yet unknown co activators expression of oct  in differentiated cells is not sufficient to activate transcription from a distance rather it requires the co expression of co activators such as the adenoviral oncoprotein e a in this paper we used phage display to identify oct  interacting proteins we first analyzed the interaction between oct  and e a in order to optimize the biochemical conditions that enable oct  specific interactions with other interacting proteins a panning approach was used to enrich oct  interacting phages from a pool of excess unspecific phages the biochemical conditions established in our interaction assays were then used to screen a p  ec cell cdna expression library in m  filamentous phage a number of phage clones displaying portions of unknown and known transcription factors were obtained from which the hmg  transcription factor was identified hmg  and the closely related factor hmg  interact with oct  when co expressed in mammalian cells in addition hmg  was found to cooperate with oct  in p  ec cells these results provide the first evidence of a non viral factor that enhances oct  distance dependent transactivation in stem cells
