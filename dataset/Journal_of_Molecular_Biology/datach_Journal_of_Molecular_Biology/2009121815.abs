a dna assisted binding assay for weak protein  protein interactions
swe describe a new method used for quantitating weak interactions between proteins in which the weak interaction is  assisted  by a known dna  dna interaction oligonucleotides which are conjugated to proteins of interest contain short complementary dna sequences that provide additional binding energy for protein  protein interactions a stretch of unpaired bases links the protein to the hybridizing dna sequence to allow formation of both protein  protein and dna  dna interactions with minimal structural interference we validated the dna assisted binding method using heterodimerizing coiled coil proteins the method was then used to measure the predicted weak interaction between two domains of the escherichia coli l arabinose operon regulatory protein arac the interaction between domains has the expected magnitude kd    mm in the absence of arabinose upon addition of arabinose we detected a weaker and unexpected interaction which may necessitate modification of the proposed mechanism of arac the dna assisted binding method may also prove useful in the study of other weak protein  protein interactions
