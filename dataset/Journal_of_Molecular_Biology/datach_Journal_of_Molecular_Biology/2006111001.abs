identification of a collapsed intermediate with non native long range interactions on the folding pathway of a pair of fyn sh domain mutants by nmr relaxation dispersion spectroscopy
recent  n and  c spin relaxation dispersion studies of fast folding mutants of the fyn sh domain have established that folding proceeds through a low populated on pathway intermediate i where the central  sheet is at least partially formed but without interactions between the nh  and cooh terminal  strands that exist in the folded state f  initial studies focused on mutants where gly  is replaced in an effort to establish whether this intermediate is a general feature of fyn sh folding a series of  n relaxation experiments monitoring the folding of fyn sh mutants n p v l and a v n p v l are reported here for these mutants as well folding proceeds through an on pathway intermediate with similar features to those observed for g m and g v fyn sh domains however the  n chemical shifts extracted for the intermediate indicate pronounced non native contacts between the nh and cooh terminal regions not observed previously the kinetic parameters extracted for the folding of a v n p v l fyn sh from the three state folding model f  i  u are in good agreement with folding and unfolding rates extrapolated to zero denaturant obtained from stopped flow experiments analyzed in terms of a simplified two state folding reaction the folding of the triple mutant was studied over a wide range of temperatures establishing that there is no difference in heat capacities between f and i states this confirms a compact folding intermediate structure which is supported by the  n chemical shifts of the i state extracted from the dispersion data the temperature dependent relaxation data simplifies data analysis because at low temperatures  lt    c the unfolded state u is negligibly populated relative to i and f a comparison between parameters extracted at low temperatures where the f  i exchange model is appropriate with those from the more complex three state model at higher temperatures has been used to validate the protocol for analysis of three site exchange relaxation data
