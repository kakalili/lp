the calcium activation of gelsolin insights from the   structure of the g  g actin complex
gelsolin participates in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton that is required during such phenomena as cell movement cytokinesis and apoptosis it consists of six structurally similar domains g  g  which are arranged at resting intracellular levels of calcium ion so as to obscure the three actin binding surfaces elevation of ca  concentrations releases latches within the constrained structure and produces large shifts in the relative positioning of the domains permitting gelsolin to bind to and sever actin filaments how ca  is able to activate gelsolin has been a major question concerning the function of this protein we present the improved structure of the c terminal half of gelsolin bound to monomeric actin at    resolution two classes of ca  binding site are evident on gelsolin type  sites share coordination of ca  with actin while type  sites are wholly contained within gelsolin this structure of the complex reveals the locations of two novel metal ion binding sites in domains g and g  respectively we identify both as type  sites the absolute conservation of the type  calcium ligating residues across the six domains of gelsolin suggests that this site exists in each of the domains in total gelsolin has the potential to bind eight calcium ions two type  and six type  the function of the type  sites is to facilitate structural rearrangements within gelsolin as part of the activation and actin binding and severing processes we propose the novel type  site in g to be the critical site that initiates overall activation of gelsolin by releasing the tail latch that locks calcium free gelsolin in a conformation unable to bind actin
