The N-terminal, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-inhibitory fragment of recombinant, human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1) exhibits varied backbone dynamics and rigidity. Most striking is the presence of chemical exchange in the MMP-binding ridge reported to undergo conformational change upon MMP binding. Conformational exchange fluctuations in microseconds to milliseconds map to the sites of MMP-induced fit at residues Val29 through Leu34 of the AB loop and to the Ala65 and Cys70 “hinges” of the CD loop of TIMP-1. Slow chemical exchange is also present at the type I turn of the EF loop at the base of the MMP-binding ridge. These functional slow motions and other fast internal motions are evident from backbone 15N spin relaxation at 500 and 750 MHz, whether interpreted by the model-free formalism with axial diffusion anisotropy or by the reduced spectral density approach. The conformational exchange is confirmed by its deviation from the trend between R2 and the cross-correlation rate η. The magnetic field-dependence indicates that the chemical exchange broadening in the AB and CD loops is fast on the time-scale of chemical shift differences. The conformational exchange rates for most of these exchanging residues, which can closely approach MMP, appear to be a few thousand to several thousand per second. The slow dynamics of the TIMP-1 AB loop contrast the picosecond to nanosecond dynamics reported in the longer TIMP-2 AB loop.
