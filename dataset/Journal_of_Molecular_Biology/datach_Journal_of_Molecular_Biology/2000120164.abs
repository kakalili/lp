inhibition of the ribosomal peptidyl transferase reaction by the mycarose moiety of the antibiotics carbomycin spiramycin and tylosin edited by d e draper
many antibiotics including the macrolides inhibit protein synthesis by binding to ribosomes only some of the macrolides affect the peptidyl transferase reaction the  member ring macrolide antibiotics carbomycin spiramycin and tylosin inhibit peptidyl transferase all these have a disaccharide at position  in the lactone ring with a mycarose moiety we have investigated the functional role of this mycarose moiety the  member ring macrolide erythromycin and the  member ring macrolides desmycosin and chalcomycin do not inhibit the peptidyl transferase reaction these drugs have a monosaccharide at position  in the lactone ring the presence of mycarose was correlated with inhibition of peptidyl transferase footprints on  s rrna and whether the macrolide can compete with binding of hygromycin a to the ribosome the binding sites of the macrolides to escherichia coli ribosomes were investigated by chemical probing of domains ii and v of  s rrna the common binding site is around position a   while effects on u   depend on the presence of the mycarose sugar also protection at position a  indicates that a mycinose moiety at position  in  member ring macrolides interact with hairpin  in domain ii competitive footprinting of ribosomal binding of hygromycin a and macrolides showed that tylosin and spiramycin reduce the hygromycin a protections of nucleotides in  s rrna and that carbomycin abolishes its binding in contrast the macrolides that do not inhibit the peptidyl transferase reaction bind to the ribosomes concurrently with hygromycin a data are presented to argue that a disaccharide at position  in the lactone ring of macrolides is essential for inhibition of peptide bond formation and that the mycarose moiety is placed near the conserved u   in the central loop region of domain v  s rrna
