traveling rocky roads the consequences of transcription blocking dna lesions on rna polymerase ii
the faithful transcription of eukaryotic genes by rna polymerase ii rnap  is crucial for proper cell function and tissue homeostasis however transcription blocking dna lesions of both endogenous and environmental origin continuously challenge the progression of elongating rnap  the stalling of rnap on a transcription blocking lesion triggers a series of highly regulated events including rnap processing to make the lesion accessible for dna repair r loop mediated dna damage signaling and the initiation of transcription coupled dna repair the correct execution and coordination of these processes is vital for resuming transcription following the successful repair of transcription blocking lesions here we outline recent insights into the molecular consequences of rnap stalling on transcription blocking dna lesions and how these lesions are resolved to restore mrna synthesis
