comparison between long range interactions and contact order in determining the folding rate of two state proteins application of long range order to folding rate prediction edited by p e wright
the contact order is believed to be an important factor for understanding protein folding mechanisms in our earlier work we have shown that the long range interactions play a vital role in protein folding in this work we analyzed the contribution of long range contacts to determine the folding rate of two state proteins we found that the residues that are close in space and are separated by at least ten to  residues in sequence are important determinants of folding rates suggesting the presence of a folding nucleus at an interval of approximately  residues a novel parameter  long range order  has been proposed to predict protein folding rates this parameter shows as good a relationship with the folding rate of two state proteins as contact order further we examined the minimum limit of residue separation to determine the long range contacts for different structural classes we observed an excellent correlation between long range order and folding rate for all classes of globular proteins we suggest that in mixed class proteins a larger number of residues can serve as folding nuclei compared to all  and all  proteins a simple statistical method has been developed to predict the folding rates of two state proteins using the long range order that produces an agreement with experimental results that is better or comparable to other methods in the literature
