assembly of chloroplast signal recognition particle involves structural rearrangement in cpsrp
signal recognition particle in chloroplasts cpsrp exhibits the unusual ability to bind and target full length proteins to the thylakoid membrane unlike cytosolic srps in prokaryotes and eukaryotes cpsrp lacks an rna moiety and functions as a heterodimer composed of a conserved  kda guanosine triphosphatase cpsrp  and a unique  kda subunit cpsrp   assembly of the cpsrp heterodimer is a prerequisite for post translational targeting activities and takes place through interactions between chromatin modifier domain  cd  of cpsrp  and a unique  amino acid region in cpsrp  cpsrp pep  we have used multidimensional nmr spectroscopy and other biophysical methods to examine the assembly and structure of the cpsrp   cpsrp  interface our data show that cd of cpsrp  binds to cpsrp pep in a   stoichiometry with an apparent kd of      m steady state fluorescence and far uv circular dichroism data suggest that the cd  cpsrp pep interaction causes significant conformational changes in both cd and the peptide comparison of the three dimensional solution structures of cd alone and in complex with cpsrp pep shows that significant structural changes are induced in cd in order to establish a binding interface contributed mostly by residues in the n terminal segment of cd  phe val  and an arginine doublet arg  and arg   in the cpsrp  peptide taken together our results provide new insights into the mechanism of cpsrp assembly and the structural forces that stabilize the functionally critical cpsrp   cpsrp  interaction
