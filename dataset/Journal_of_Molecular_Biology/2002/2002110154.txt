A synthetic cruciform DNA (X-DNA) was used for screening cellular extracts of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for X-DNA-binding activity. Three X-DNA-binding proteins with apparent molecular mass of 28kDa, 26kDa and 24kDa, estimated by SDS-PAGE, were partially purified. They were identified as N-terminal fragments originating from the same putative protein, encoded by the open reading frame YHR146W, which we named CRP1 (cruciform DNA-recognising protein 1). Expression of CRP1 in Escherichia coli showed that Crp1p is subject to efficient proteolysis at one specific site. Cleavage leads to an N-terminal subpeptide of approximately 160 amino acid residues that is capable of binding specifically X-DNA with an estimated dissociation constant (Kd) of 800nM, and a C-terminal subpeptide of approximately 305 residues without intrinsic X-DNA-binding activity. The N-terminal subpeptide is of a size similarly to that of the fragments identified in yeast, suggesting that the same cleavage process occurs in the yeast and the E.coli background. This makes the action of a site-specific protease unlikely and favours the possibility of an autoproteolytic activity of Crp1p. The DNA-binding domain of Crp1p was mapped to positions 120â€“141. This domain can act autonomously as an X-DNA-binding peptide and provides a new, lysine-rich DNA-binding domain different from those of known cruciform DNA-binding proteins (CBPs). As reported earlier for several other CBPs, Crp1p exerts an enhancing effect on the cleavage of X-DNA by endonuclease VII from bacteriophage T4.
