a monomeric photoconvertible fluorescent protein for imaging of dynamic protein localization
the use of green to red photoconvertible fluorescent proteins fps enables researchers to highlight a subcellular population of a fusion protein of interest and to image its dynamics in live cells in an effort to enrich the arsenal of photoconvertible fps and to overcome the limitations imposed by the oligomeric structure of natural photoconvertible fps we designed and optimized a new monomeric photoconvertible fp using monomeric versions of clavularia sp cyan fp as template we employed sequence alignment guided design to create a chromophore environment analogous to that shared by known photoconvertible fps the designed gene was synthesized and when expressed in escherichia coli found to produce green fluorescent colonies that gradually switched to red after exposure to white light we subjected this first generation fp named mclavgr  monomeric clavularia derived green to red photoconvertible   to a combination of random and targeted mutageneses and screened libraries for efficient photoconversion using a custom built system for illuminating a  cm petri plate with   nm light following more than  rounds of library creation and screening we settled on an optimized version known as mclavgr  that has eight mutations relative to mclavgr  key improvements of mclavgr relative to mclavgr include a   fold brighter red species   fold higher photoconversion contrast and dramatically improved chromophore maturation in e coli the monomeric status of mclavgr has been demonstrated by gel filtration chromatography and the functional expression of a variety of mclavgr chimeras in mammalian cells furthermore we have exploited mclavgr to determine the diffusion kinetics of the membrane protein intercellular adhesion molecule  both when the membrane is in contact with a t lymphocyte expressing leukocyte function associated antigen  and when it is not these experiments clearly establish that mclavgr is well suited for rapid photoconversion of protein subpopulations and subsequent tracking of dynamic changes in localization in living cells
