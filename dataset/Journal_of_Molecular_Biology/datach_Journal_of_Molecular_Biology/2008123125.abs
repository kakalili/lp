the structure of monoamine oxidase from aspergillus niger provides a molecular context for improvements in activity obtained by directed evolution
monoamine oxidase from aspergillus niger mao n is a flavoenzyme that catalyses the oxidative deamination of primary amines mao n has been used as the starting model for a series of directed evolution experiments resulting in mutants of improved activity and broader substrate specificity suitable for application in the preparative deracemisation of primary secondary and tertiary amines when used as part of a chemoenzymatic oxidation  reduction cycle the structures of a three point mutant asn  ser met  lys ile  met or mao n d  and a five point mutant asn  ser met  lys ile  met thr  asn asp  ser or mao n d  have been obtained using a multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction experiment on a selenomethionine derivative of the truncated mao n d enzyme mao n exists as a homotetramer with a large channel at its centre and shares some structural features with human mao b mao b  a hydrophobic cavity extends from the protein surface to the active site where a non covalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide fad sits at the base of an  aromatic cage   the sides of which are formed by trp  and phe   a molecule of l proline was observed near the fad and this ligand superimposed well with isatin a reversible inhibitor of mao b when the structures of mao n proline and mao b isatin were overlaid of the mutations that confer the ability to catalyse the oxidation of secondary amines in mao n d  asn  ser reduces steric bulk behind trp  of the aromatic cage and ile  met confers greater flexibility within the substrate binding site the two additional mutations thr  asn and asp  ser that occur in the mao n d variant which is able to oxidise tertiary amines appear to influence the active site environment remotely through changes in tertiary structure that perturb the side chain of phe   again altering the steric and electronic character of the active site near fad the possible implications of the change in steric and electronic environment caused by relevant mutations are discussed with respect to the improved catalytic efficiency of the mao n variants described in the literature
