mapping rna protein interactions in ribonuclease p from escherichia coli using disulfide linked edta fe edited by k nagai
the protein subunit of escherichia coli ribonuclease p which has a cysteine residue at position   and its single cysteine substituted mutant derivatives s c c  s k c c  s and k c c  s have been modified using a sulfhydryl specific iron complex of edta  aminoethyl  pyridyl disulfide epd fe  this reaction converts c protein or its single cysteine substituted mutant derivatives into chemical nucleases which are capable of cleaving the cognate rna ligand m rna the catalytic rna subunit of e coli rnase p in the presence of ascorbate and hydrogen peroxide cleavages in m rna are expected to occur at positions proximal to the site of contact between the modified residue in c protein and the ribose units in m rna when epd fe was used to modify residue cys  in c protein hydroxyl radical mediated cleavages occurred predominantly in the p helix of m rna present in the reconstituted holoenzyme c cys  edta fe produced cleavages on the   strand of the p pseudoknot of m rna while the cleavages promoted by c cys  edta fe were in the loop connecting helices p  and p  j   and the loop j   preceding the   strand of the p pseudoknot however hydroxyl radical mediated cleavages in m rna were not evident with cys  edta fe perhaps indicative of cys  being distal from the rna protein interface in the rnase p holoenzyme our directed hydroxyl radical mediated footprinting experiments indicate that conserved residues in the rna and protein subunit of the rnase p holoenzyme are adjacent to each other and provide structural information essential for understanding the assembly of rnase p
