the n terminal domain of homer vesl is a new class ii evh domain edited by r huber
cellular activities controlled by signal transduction processes such as cell motility and cell growth depend on the tightly regulated assembly of multiprotein complexes adapter proteins that specifically interact with their target proteins are key components required for the formation of these assemblies ena vasp homology  evh  domains are small constituents of large modular proteins involved in microfilament assembly that specifically recognize proline rich regions evh domain containing proteins are present in neuronal cells like the homer vesl protein family that is involved in memory generating processes here we describe the crystal structure of the murine evh domain of vesl  at    resolution the small globular protein consists of a seven stranded antiparallel  barrel with a c terminal  helix packing alongside the barrel a shallow groove running parallel with  strand vi forms an extended peptide binding site using peptide library screenings we present data that demonstrate the high affinity of the vesl  evh domain towards peptide sequences containing a proline rich core sequence ppspf that requires additional charged amino acid residues on either side for specific binding our functional data substantiated by structural data demonstrate that the ligand binding of the vesl evh domain differs from the interaction characteristics of the previously examined evh domains of the evl mena proteins analogous to the src homology  sh  domains that bind their cognate ligands in two distinct directions we therefore propose the existence of two distinct classes of evh domains
