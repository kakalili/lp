extended substrate recognition in caspase  revealed by high resolution x ray structure analysis
caspases are cysteine proteases involved in the signalling cascades of programmed cell death in which caspase  plays a central role since it propagates death signals from intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli to downstream targets the atomic resolution      crystal structure of the caspase  devd cmk complex reveals the structural basis for substrate selectivity in the s pocket a low barrier hydrogen bond is observed between the side chains of the p inhibitor aspartic acid and asp  of the n terminal tail of the symmetry related p  subunit site directed mutagenesis of asp  confirmed the significance of this residue in substrate recognition in the     crystal structure a radiation damage induced rearrangement of the inhibitor methylketone moiety was observed the carbon atom that in a substrate would represent the scissile peptide bond carbonyl carbon clearly shows a tetrahedral coordination and resembles the postulated tetrahedral intermediate of the acylation reaction
