partitioning protein structures into domains why is it so difficult
this analysis takes an in depth look into the difficulties encountered by automatic methods for domain decomposition from three dimensional structure the analysis involves a multi faceted set of criteria including the integrity of secondary structure elements the tendency toward fragmentation of domains domain boundary consistency and topology the strength of the analysis comes from the use of a new comprehensive benchmark dataset which is based on consensus among experts cath scop and authors of the d structures and covers  distinct architectures and   distinct topologies as defined by cath furthermore over   of the structures are multi domain proteins each domain combination occurring once per dataset the performance of four automatic domain assignment methods domainparser ncbi pdp and puu is carefully analyzed using this broad spectrum of topology combinations and knowledge of rules and assumptions built into each algorithm we conclude that it is practically impossible for an automatic method to achieve the level of performance of human experts however we propose specific improvements to automatic methods as well as broadening the concept of a structural domain such work is prerequisite for establishing improved approaches to domain recognition  the benchmark dataset is available from http  pdomains sdsc edu
