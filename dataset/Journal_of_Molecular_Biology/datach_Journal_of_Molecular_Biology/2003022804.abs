mycobacterium tuberculosis hsp   nonamers are assembled and re assembled via trimer and hexamer intermediates
hsp   a small heat shock protein from mycobacterium tuberculosis proposed to form specific trimer of trimers structures acts as a molecular chaperone in vitro the assembly and re assembly mechanisms of this oligomeric protein were studied and compared using in vitro transcription translation and denaturization renaturization systems analysis using a combination of non denaturing pore gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis chemical cross linking and size exclusion chromatography demonstrate that the predominant form of hsp   produced in the in vitro transcription translation system is the trimer which can be further assembled into a nonameric structure via a hexamer intermediate in the presence of purified exogenous hsp   proteins meanwhile an  inert  hsp   dimer which does not seem to participate in nonamer assembly but may be involved in forming other forms of hsp   was also detected in the in vitro expression system on the other hand our current data clearly show that the re assembly of hsp   nonamers also occurs via a very similar mechanism with the formation of trimers and hexamers the presence of high levels of macromolecular crowding protein agent in the in vitro expression system promoted the formation of the nonamers to a very limited degree indicating that the assembly of proteins like hsp   may depend mainly on its own concentration instead of those of the macromolecules in the environment
