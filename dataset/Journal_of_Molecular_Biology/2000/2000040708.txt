The haemopoietic cytokines, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-3 and interleukin-5 bind to cell-surface receptors comprising ligand-specific α-chains and a shared β-chain. The β-chain is the critical signalling subunit of the receptor and its fourth domain not only plays a critical role in interactions with ligands, hence in receptor activation, but also contains residues whose mutation can lead to ligand-independent activation of the receptor. We have determined the NMR solution structure of the isolated human fourth domain of the β-chain. The protein has a fibronectin type III fold with a well-defined hydrophobic core and is stabilised by an extensive network of π-cation interactions involving Trp and Arg side-chains, including two Trp residues outside the highly conserved Trp-Ser-Xaa-Trp-Ser motif (where Xaa is any amino acid) that is found in many cytokine receptors. Most of the residues implicated in factor-independent mutants localise to the rigid core of the domain or the π-cation stack. The loops between the B and C, and the F and G strands, that contain residues important for interactions with cytokines, lie adjacent at the membrane-distal end of the domain, consistent with their being involved cooperatively in binding cytokines. The elucidation of the structure of the cytokine-binding domain of the β-chain provides insight into the cytokine-dependent and factor-independent activation of the receptor.
