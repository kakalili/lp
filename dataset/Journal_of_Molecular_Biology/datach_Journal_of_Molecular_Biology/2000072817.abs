a statistical appraisal of native state hydrogen exchange data evidence for a burst phase continuum  edited by p e wright
for a number of proteins folding occurs via the rapid accumulation of secondary and tertiary structural features in a so called burst phase preceding the relatively slow highly activated transition leading to the native state a fundamental question is do these burst phase reactions comprise two phase separated thermodynamic states or a continuum of states ribonuclease hi rnase h from escherichia coli and phage t lysozyme t l both exhibit such a phenomenon native state hydrogen exchange nhx data have been collected for these proteins providing residue specific free energies and m values a measure of hydrocarbon solvation for the manifold of partially unfolded exchange competent forms that are accessible from the native state  gsg and msg where the sg subscript denotes sub global  there is good evidence that these parameters pertain to exchange competent species comprising the burst phase observed in the global folding kinetics we combine the results from the global folding kinetics of these proteins with a statistical analysis of their nhx parameters to determine if the distribution of experimental msg  gsg values derive from a mechanism where the burst phase is two state for rnase h this analysis demonstrates that the burst phase of this protein is not two state the results imply a distribution of states m and  g exhibiting a linear functional relationship consistent with the global folding parameters for t l it is difficult to distinguish the observed distribution of msg  gsg values from that expected for a mechanism where the burst phase is two state the results for rnase h  lend support for the idea that the burst phase reaction of this protein comprises a continuum of states this has important implications for how we model the process of structural acquisition in protein folding reactions
