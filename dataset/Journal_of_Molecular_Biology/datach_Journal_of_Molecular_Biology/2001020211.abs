high pressure nmr reveals a variety of fluctuating conformers in  lactoglobulin edited by c r matthews
high pressure h  n two dimensional nmr spectroscopy has been used to study conformational fluctuation in bovine  lactoglobulin at ph   and   c pressure dependencies of h and  n chemical shifts and cross peak intensities were analyzed at more than  independent atom sites between  and   bar unusually large and non linear chemical shift pressure dependencies are found for residues centering in the hydrophobic core region suggesting the existence of low lying excited native states n   of the protein measurement of h  n cross peak intensities at individual amide sites as a function of pressure suggests that unfolding events occur independently in two sides of the  barrel i e the hydrophobic core side  f h  producing i  and the non core side  b e  producing i  at  bar the stability is higher for the core region  g       kcal mol than for the non core region       kcal mol  but at high pressure the stability is reversed due to a larger  v value of unfolding for the core region        ml mol than that for the non core region        ml mol  possibly due to an uneven distribution of cavities the  g profile along the amino acid sequence obtained from the pressure experiment is found to coincide well with that estimated from hydrogen exchange experiments altogether the high pressure nmr experiment has revealed a variety of fluctuating conformers of  lactoglobulin notably n n   i  i and the totally unfolded conformer u fluctuation of n to i and i conformers with open barrel structures could be a common design of lipocalin family proteins which bind various hydrophobic compounds in its barrel structure
