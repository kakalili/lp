structure of the major membrane protein complex from urinary bladder epithelial cells by cryo electron crystallography edited by w baumeister
numerous protein plaques cover the apical surface of mammalian urinary bladder epithelial cells these plaques contain four integral membrane proteins called uroplakins which form a well ordered array of hexameric complexes the d structure of these naturally occurring d crystals was studied by cryo electron crystallographic methods using a slow scan charged coupled device ccd camera to record the electron micrographs a   nm projection map calculated from untilted crystals shows that each hexamer comprises a ring of six inner and six outer domains at a radius of   nm and   nm respectively the d structure shows that the mass is distributed strongly asymmetrically with respect to the membrane with most of the mass protruding from the luminal face both domains in the asymmetric unit traverse the membrane and protrude from the membrane on the cytoplasmic side on the luminal side the two domains are bridged forming a stretched arc the total thickness of the complex is about   nm a model of the urothelial plaque reveals that contacts between the hexamers are much less extended than within the hexamers
