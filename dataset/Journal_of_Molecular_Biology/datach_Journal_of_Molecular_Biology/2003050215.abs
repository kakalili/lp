rad  is involved in repair of damage associated with dna replication in mammalian cells
the rad  protein a eukaryotic homologue of the escherichia coli reca protein plays an important role in the repair of dna double strand breaks dsbs by homologous recombination hr in mammalian cells recent findings suggest that hr may be important in repair following replication arrest in mammalian cells here we have investigated the role of rad  in the repair of different types of damage induced during dna replication with etoposide hydroxyurea or thymidine we show that etoposide induces dsbs at newly replicated dna more frequently than  rays and that these dsbs are different from those induced by hydroxyurea no dsb was found following treatment with thymidine although these compounds appear to induce different dna lesions during dna replication we show that a cell line overexpressing rad  is resistant to all of them indicating that rad  is involved in repair of a wide range of dna lesions during dna replication we observe fewer etoposide induced dsbs in rad  overexpressing cells and that hr repair of etoposide induced dsbs is faster finally we show that induced long tract hr in the hprt gene is suppressed in rad  overexpressing cells although global hr appears not to be suppressed this suggests that overexpression of rad  prevents long tract hr occurring during dna replication we discuss our results in light of recent models suggested for hr at stalled replication forks
