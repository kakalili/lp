the atpase domain of seca can form a tetramer in solution edited by i b holland
preprotein translocase is a general and essential system for bacterial protein export the minimal components of which are seca and secyeg seca is a peripheral atpase that associates with nucleotide preprotein and the membrane integral secyeg to form a translocation competent complex seca can be separated into two domains an n terminal  kda atpase domain n  that binds preprotein and catalyzes atp hydrolysis and a  kda c terminal domain that regulates the atpase activity of n  and mediates dimerization we have carried out gel filtration chromatography analytical ultracentrifugation and small angle x ray scattering saxs to demonstrate that isolated n  self associates to form a tetramer in solution indicating that removal of the c terminal domain facilitates the formation of a higher order seca structure the associative process is best modelled as a monomer tetramer equilibrium with a kd value of   m  where kd  monomer  tetramer  so that at moderate concentrations    m and above  the tetramer is the major species in solution hydrodynamic properties of the n  monomer indicate that it is almost globular in shape but the n  tetramer has a more ellipsoidal structure analysis of saxs data indicates that the n  tetramer is a flattened bi lobed structure with dimensions of approximately   nm    nm    nm that appears to contain a central pore
