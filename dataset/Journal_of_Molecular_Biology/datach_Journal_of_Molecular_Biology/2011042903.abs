the structure of a truncated phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase suggests a unified model for evolution of the     barrel fold
the     barrel is one of the most common protein folds and enzymes with this architecture display a remarkable range of catalytic activities many of these functions are associated with ancient metabolic pathways and phylogenetic reconstructions suggest that the     barrel was one of the very first protein folds to emerge consequently there is considerable interest in understanding the evolutionary processes that gave rise to this fold in particular much attention has been focused on the plausibility of     barrel evolution from homodimers of half barrels however we previously isolated a three quarter barrel sized fragment of a     barrel termed truncated phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase trprai  that is soluble and almost as thermostable as full length n    phosphoribosyl anthranilate isomerase prai  here we report the nmr derived structure of trprai the subdomain is monomeric is well ordered and adopts a native like structure in solution side chains from strands   glu and lys     tyr  and   lys   of trprai repack to shield the hydrophobic core from the solvent this result demonstrates that three quarter barrels were viable intermediates in the evolution of the     barrel fold we propose a unified model for     barrel evolution that combines our data previously published work and plausible scenarios for the emergence of initially error prone genetic systems in this model the earliest proto cells contained diverse pools of part barrel subdomains combinatorial assembly of these subdomains gave rise to many distinct lineages of     barrel proteins that is our model excludes the possibility that there was a single     barrel from which all present examples are descended
