insights into the replisome from the structure of a ternary complex of the dna polymerase iii  subunit
the crystal structure of the catalytic   subunit of the dna polymerase iii poliii  holoenzyme bound to primer  template dna and an incoming deoxy nucleoside   triphosphate has been determined at    resolution the polymerase interacts with the sugar  phosphate backbone of the dna across its minor groove which is made possible by significant movements of the thumb finger and  binding domains relative to their orientations in the unliganded polymerase structure additionally the dna and incoming nucleotide are bound to the active site of poliii  nearly identically as they are in their complex with dna polymerase   thereby proving that the eubacterial replicating polymerase but not the eukaryotic replicating polymerase is homologous to dna polymerase   finally superimposing a recent structure of the clamp bound to dna on this poliii  complex with dna places a loop of the  binding domain into the appropriate clamp cleft and supports a mechanism of polymerase switching
