specificity for homooligomer versus heterooligomer formation in integrin transmembrane helices
transmembrane tm helices engage in homomeric and heteromeric interactions that play essential roles in the folding and assembly of tm proteins however features that explain their propensity to interact homomerically or heteromerically and determine the strength of these interactions are poorly understood integrins provide an ideal model system for addressing these questions because the tm helices of full length integrins interact heteromerically when integrins are inactive but isolated tm helices are also able to form homodimers or homooligomers in micelles and bacterial membranes we sought to determine the features defining specificity for homointeractions versus heterointeractions by conducting a comprehensive comparison of the homomeric and heteromeric interactions of integrin  iib  tm helices in biological membranes using the toxcat assay we found that residues v   m   a   i   l   g   l   l   and l   which are located on the same face of the   helix mediate homodimer formation we then characterized the   heterodimer by measuring the ability of   helix mutations to cause ligand binding to  iib   we found that mutating v   l   v   m   a   i   l   g   l   and l   but not the small residue  x  small residue motif s   x  a   caused constitutive  iib  activation as well as persistent focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation dependent on  iib  activation because  iib and   use the same face of their respective tm helices for homomeric and heteromeric interactions the interacting surface on each has an intrinsic  stickiness  predisposing towards helix  helix interactions in membranes the residues responsible for heterodimer formation comprise a network of interdigitated side chains with considerable geometric complementarity mutations along this interface invariably destabilize heterodimer formation by contrast residues responsible for homomeric interactions are dispersed over a wider surface while most mutations of these residues are destabilizing some stabilized homooligomer formation we conclude that the  iib  tm heterodimer shows the hallmark of finely tuned heterodimeric interaction while homomeric interaction is less specific
