subunit assembly and mode of dna cleavage of the type iii restriction endonucleases ecop i and ecop i edited by j karn
dna cleavage by type iii restriction endonucleases requires two inversely oriented asymmetric recognition sequences and results from atp dependent dna translocation and collision of two enzyme molecules here we characterized the structure and mode of action of the related ecop i and ecop i enzymes analytical ultracentrifugation and gel quantification revealed a common res mod subunit stoichiometry single alanine substitutions in the putative nuclease active site of resp and resp  abolished dna but not atp hydrolysis whilst a substitution in helicase motif vi abolished both activities positively supercoiled dna substrates containing a pair of inversely oriented recognition sites were cleaved inefficiently whereas the corresponding relaxed and negatively supercoiled substrates were cleaved efficiently suggesting that dna overtwisting impedes the convergence of the translocating enzymes ecop i and ecop i could co operate in dna cleavage on circular substrate containing several ecop i sites inversely oriented to a single ecop i site cleavage occurred predominantly at the ecop i site ecop i alone showed nicking activity on these molecules cutting exclusively the top dna strand at its recognition site this activity was dependent on enzyme concentration and local dna sequence the ecop i nuclease mutant greatly stimulated the ecop i nicking activity while the ecop i motif vi mutant did not moreover combining an ecop i nuclease mutant with wild type ecop i resulted in cutting the bottom dna strand at the ecop i site these data suggest that double strand breaks result from top strand cleavage by a res subunit proximal to the site of cleavage whilst bottom strand cleavage is catalysed by a res subunit supplied in trans by the distal endonuclease in the collision complex
