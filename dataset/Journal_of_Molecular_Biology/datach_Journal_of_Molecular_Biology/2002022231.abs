reaction mechanism of gtp cyclohydrolase i single turnover experiments using a kinetically competent reaction intermediate edited by j karn
elsevier science ltd gtp cyclohydrolase i catalyses the transformation of gtp into dihydroneopterin   triphosphate which is the first committed precursor of tetrahydrofolate and tetrahydrobiopterin the kinetically competent reaction intermediate  amino  formylamino  ribosylamino  h pyrimidinone was used as substrate for single turnover experiments monitored by multiwavelength photometry the early reaction phase is characterized by the rapid appearance of an optical transient with an absorption maximum centred at   this species is likely to represent a schiff base intermediate at the initial stage of the amadori rearrangement of the carbohydrate side chain deconvolution of the optical spectra suggested four linearly independent processes a fifth reaction step was attributed to photodecomposition of the enzyme product pre steady state experiments were also performed with the h  a mutant which can catalyse a reversible conversion of gtp to  amino  formylamino  ribosylamino  h pyrimidinone but is unable to form the final product dihydroneopterin triphosphate optical spectroscopy failed to detect any intermediate in the reversible reaction sequence catalysed by the mutant protein the data obtained with the wild type and mutant protein in conjunction with earlier quenched flow studies show that the enzyme catalysed opening of the imidazole ring of gtp and the hydrolytic release of formate from the resulting formamide type intermediate are both rapid reactions by comparison with the subsequent rearrangement of the carbohydrate side chain which precedes the formation of the dihydropyrazine ring of dihydroneopterin triphosphate
