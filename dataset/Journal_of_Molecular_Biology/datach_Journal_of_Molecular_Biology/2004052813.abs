molecular evolution of a microrna cluster
many of the known micrornas are encoded in polycistronic transcripts here we reconstruct the evolutionary history of the mir  microrna clusters which consist of mir   mir   mir  a mir  b mir   mir   mir   mir   mir  a and mir  b the history of this cluster is governed by an initial phase of local tandem duplications a series of duplications of entire clusters and subsequent loss of individual micrornas from the resulting paralogous clusters the complex history of the mir  microrna family appears to be closely linked to the early evolution of the vertebrate lineage
