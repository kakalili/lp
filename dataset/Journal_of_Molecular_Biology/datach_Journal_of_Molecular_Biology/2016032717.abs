mapping the interaction network of key proteins involved in histone mrna generation a hydrogen deuterium exchange study
histone pre mrnas are cleaved at the   end by a complex that contains u snrnp the flice associated huge protein flash and histone pre mrna cleavage complex hcc consisting of several polyadenylation factors within the complex the n terminus of flash interacts with the n terminus of the u snrnp protein lsm  and together they recruit the hcc flash through its distant c terminus independently interacts with the c terminal sant myb like domain of nuclear protein ataxia telangiectasia locus npat  a transcriptional co activator required for expression of histone genes in s phase to gain structural information on these interactions we used mass spectrometry to monitor hydrogen deuterium exchange in various regions of flash lsm  and npat alone or in the presence of their respective binding partners our results indicate that the flash interacting domain in lsm  is highly dynamic while the more downstream region required for recruiting the hcc exchanges deuterium slowly and likely folds into a stable structure in flash a stable structure is adopted by the domain that interacts with lsm  and this domain is further stabilized by binding lsm  notably both hydrogen deuterium exchange experiments and in vitro binding assays demonstrate that lsm  in addition to interacting with the n terminal region of flash also contacts the c terminal sant myb like domain of flash the same region that binds npat however while npat stabilizes this domain lsm  causes its partial relaxation these competing reactions may play a role in regulating histone gene expression in vivo
