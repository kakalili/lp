functional characterization of a conserved archaeal viral operon revealing single stranded dna binding annealing and nuclease activities
the majority of archaeal viral genes are of unknown function hindering our understanding of the virus life cycle and viral interactions with their host here we first describe functional characterization of orf  b gp  and orf   gp  of sulfolobus islandicus rod shaped virus  sirv  both encoding proteins of unknown function and forming an operon with orf   gp   sirv gp  was found to be a single stranded dna ssdna binding protein different in structure from all previously characterized ssdna binding proteins mutagenesis of a few conserved basic residues suggested a u shaped binding path for ssdna the recombinant gp  showed an ssdna annealing activity often associated with helicases and recombinases to gain insight into the biological role of the entire operon we characterized sirv gp  and showed it to possess a       ssdna exonuclease activity in addition to the previously demonstrated ssdna endonuclease activity further in vitro pull down assay demonstrated interactions between gp  and gp  and between gp  and gp  with the former being mediated by the intrinsically disordered c terminus of gp  the strand displacement replication mode proposed previously for rudiviruses and the close interaction among the ssdna binding annealing and nuclease proteins strongly point to a role of the gene operon in genome maturation and or dna recombination that may function in viral dna replication repair
