refined crystal structures of human ca  zn  binding s  a protein characterized by two disulfide bridges
s  a  a member of the ef hand type ca  binding s  protein family is unique in its exceptionally high cysteine content and zn  affinity we produced human s  a protein and its mutants in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system the purified wild type s  a and the pseudo citrullinated form r a were crystallized with ammonium sulfate in n n bis  hydroxyethyl glycine buffer and specifically for postrefolding treatment with ca  zn  supplementation we identified two previously undocumented disulfide bridges in the crystal structure of properly folded s  a  one disulfide bridge is between cys  in the n terminal pseudo ef hand and cys  in the c terminal ef hand ss  and another disulfide bridge attaches cys  in the c terminal coil structure to cys  in helix iv ss  mutational disruption of ss  c a c a abolished the ca  binding property of s  a and retarded the citrullination of arg  by peptidylarginine deiminase type iii pad  while ss disruption inversely increased both ca  affinity and pad reactivity in vitro similar backbone structures of wild type r a and c a c a indicated that neither arg  conversion by pad nor ss alters the overall dimer conformation comparative inspection of atomic coordinates refined to         resolution shows that ss renders the c terminal classical ca  binding loop flexible which are essential for its ca  binding properties whereas ss structurally shelters arg  in the metal free form we propose a model of the tetrahedral coordination of a zn  by cys his residues that is compatible with ss formation in s  a
