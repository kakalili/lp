crystal structures of complexes of bacterial dd peptidases with peptidoglycan mimetic ligands the substrate specificity puzzle
the x ray crystal structures of covalent complexes of the actinomadura r  dd peptidase and escherichia coli penicillin binding protein pbp  with  lactams bearing peptidoglycan mimetic side chains have been determined the structure of the hydrolysis product of an analogous peptide bound noncovalently to the former enzyme has also been obtained the r  dd peptidase structures reveal the presence of a specific binding site for the d  aminopimelyl side chain characteristic of the stem peptide of actinomadura r  this binding site features a hydrophobic cleft for the pimelyl methylene groups and strong hydrogen bonding to the polar terminus both of these active site elements are provided by amino acid side chains from two separate domains of the protein in contrast no clear electron density corresponding to the terminus of the peptidoglycan mimetic side chains is present when these  lactams are covalently bound to pbp  there is therefore no indication of a specific side chain binding site in this enzyme these results are in agreement with those from kinetics studies published earlier and support the general prediction made at the time of a direct correlation between kinetics and structural evidence the essential high molecular mass pbps have demonstrated to date no specific reactivity with peptidoglycan mimetic peptide substrates and  lactam inhibitors and thus probably do not possess a specific substrate binding site of the type demonstrated here with the r  dd peptidase this striking deficiency may represent a sophisticated defense mechanism against low molecular mass substrate  analogue inhibitors antibiotics its discovery should focus new inhibitor design
