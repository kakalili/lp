increased expression and activation of c jun contributes to human amylin induced apoptosis in pancreatic islet  cells
the role of c jun in apoptosis evoked by human amylin was investigated using human and rat insulinoma  cell lines two transient increases in the levels of c jun mrna were detected at  minutes and eight hours after treatment with human amylin the level of c jun protein was also up regulated in a time dependent manner reaching maximal levels after eight hours of exposure however no c jun induction was detected in cells treated with vehicle only or with rat amylin indicating that the amyloidogenic feature of the human peptide may be important for c jun induction we found that c jun was activated by phosphorylation specifically at ser  at four hours but not at ser  after treatment with human amylin preceding increased c jun protein furthermore expression of an antisense c jun as c jun  which suppressed protein levels of both c jun and phosphorylated c jun caused a marked reduction in apoptotic cell death whereas the corresponding sense c jun s c jun had no effect on changes of either c jun production or apoptosis this indicated that increased expression and activation of c jun is required for human amylin induced apoptosis immunocytochemical studies showed a significant increase in nuclear staining for c jun phosphorylated c jun ser  and phosphorylated jnk suggesting that c jun may be activated through activation of jnk in addition electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the increase in expression and phosphorylation of c jun was associated with increased ap  dna binding activity supershift assays demonstrated that c jun c fos and atf  are part of the ap  complex indicating that activated c jun is dimerized with c fos or atf  for control of its target gene expression finally we showed that human amylin triggers ap  mediated transcriptional activation our results suggest strongly that human amylin induces apoptosis through stimulation of expression and activation of c jun and that co expression and dimerization of c jun and c fos or atf  may be important for activation of the downstream apoptotic process
