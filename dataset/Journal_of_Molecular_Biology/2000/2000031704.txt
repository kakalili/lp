TNfn3, the third fibronectin type III domain of human tenascin, is an immunoglobulin-like protein that is a good model for experimental and theoretical analyses of Greek key folding. The third fibronectin type III domain of human tenascin folds and unfolds in a two-state fashion over a range of temperature and pH values, and in the presence of stabilising salts. Here, we present a high resolution protein engineering analysis of the single rate determining transition state. The 48 mutations report on the contribution of side-chains at 32 sites in the core and loop regions. Three areas in the protein exhibit high Φ-values, indicating that they are partially structured in the transition state. First, a common-core ring of four positions in the central strands B, C, E and F, that are in close contact, form a nucleus of tertiary interactions. The two other regions that appear well-formed are the C′ region and the E-F loop. The Φ-values gradually decrease away from these regions such that the very ends of the two terminal strands A and G, have Φ-values of zero. We propose a model for the folding of immunoglobulin-like proteins in which the common-core “ring” forms the nucleus for folding, whilst the C′ and E-F regions are constrained by topology to pack early. Folding characteristics of a group of structurally related proteins appear to support this model.
