ultrahigh resolution structure of a class a  lactamase on the mechanism and specificity of the extended spectrum shv  enzyme
bacterial  lactamases hydrolyze  lactam antibiotics such as penicillins and cephalosporins the tem type class a  lactamase shv  is a natural variant that exhibits activity against third generation cephalosporins normally resistant to hydrolysis by class a enzymes shv  contains a single gly  ser change relative to the wild type enzyme shv  crystallographic refinement of a model including hydrogen atoms gave r and rfree of    and    for data to    resolution the hydrogen atom on the o  atom of the reactive ser  is clearly seen for the first time bridging to the water molecule activated by glu   though hydrogen atoms on the nearby lys  are not seen this observation of the ser  hydrogen atom and the hydrogen bonding pattern around lys  indicate that lys  is protonated these findings support a role for the glu   water couple rather than lys  as the general base in the deprotonation of ser  in the acylation process of class a  lactamases overlay of shv  with shv  shows a significant     displacement in the       strand turn segment making the  lactam binding site more open to newer cephalosporins with large c substituents and thereby expanding the substrate spectrum of the variant enzyme the oh group of the buried ser  side chain hydrogen bonds to the main chain co of asn  on the  loop that is unaltered in position relative to shv  this structural role for ser  in protein  protein binding makes less likely its hydrogen bonding to oximino cephalosporins such as cefotaxime or ceftazidime
