mannosidase ia is in quality control vesicles and participates in glycoprotein targeting to erad
endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation erad of a misfolded glycoprotein in mammalian cells requires the removal of    alpha   linked mannose residues from its n glycans the trimming and recognition processes are ascribed to er mannosidase i the er degradation enhancing mannosidase like proteins edems  and the lectins os  and xtp b all residing in the er the er derived quality control compartment erqc  or quality control vesicles qcvs  folded glycoproteins with untrimmed glycans are transported from the er to the golgi complex where they are substrates of other alpha   mannosidases ia ib and ic the apparent redundancy of these enzymes has been puzzling for many years we have now determined that surprisingly mannosidase ia is not located in the golgi but resides in qcvs we had recently described this type of vesicles which carry er    mannosidase i ermani  we show that the overexpression of alpha class i    mannosidase ia mania significantly enhances the degradation of erad substrates and its knockdown stabilizes it our results indicate that mania trims mannose residues from man glcnac down to man glcnac  acting in parallel with ermani and the edems and targeting misfolded glycoproteins to erad
