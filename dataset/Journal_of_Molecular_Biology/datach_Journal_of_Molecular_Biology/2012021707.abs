atp binding and hydrolysis driven rate determining events in the rfc catalyzed pcna clamp loading reaction
the multi subunit replication factor c rfc complex loads circular proliferating cell nuclear antigen pcna clamps onto dna where they serve as mobile tethers for polymerases and coordinate the functions of many other dna metabolic proteins the clamp loading reaction is complex involving multiple components rfc pcna dna and atp and events minimally pcna opening closing dna binding release and atp binding hydrolysis that yield a topologically linked clamp dna product in less than a second here we report pre steady state measurements of several steps in the reaction catalyzed by saccharomyces cerevisiae rfc and present a comprehensive kinetic model based on global analysis of the data highlights of the reaction mechanism are that atp binding to rfc initiates slow activation of the clamp loader enabling it to open pcna at    s   and bind primer  template dna ptdna  rapid binding of ptdna leads to formation of the rfc atp pcnaopen ptdna complex which catalyzes a burst of atp hydrolysis another slow step in the reaction follows atp hydrolysis and is associated with pcna closure around ptdna   s    dissociation of pcna ptdna from rfc leads to catalytic turnover we propose that these early and late rate determining events are intramolecular conformational changes in rfc and pcna that control clamp opening and closure and that atp binding and hydrolysis switch rfc between conformations with high and low affinities respectively for open pcna and ptdna and thus bookend the clamp loading reaction
