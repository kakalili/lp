structure of the ecto adp ribosyl transferase art  from rat
the mammalian extracellular adp ribosyl transferases art through art are sequence related to each other among them art is involved in immuno regulation the variant art  was expressed in the periplasm of escherichia coli and crystallized its structure was determined by x ray diffraction at    resolution in one crystal form and at slightly lower resolutions in two others the active center was indicated by a ligated nicotinamide analogue which also revealed a small induced fit the centerpiece of the chainfold of art  agrees with those of all bacterial adp ribosyl transferases this correspondence and the nicotinamide position were used to model the binding structure of the whole substrate nad at art   two of the bacterial enzymes are structurally more closely related to art  while the others are more closely related to the eukaryotic poly adp ribosyl polymerase this splits the adp ribosyl transferases into two distinct subfamilies a special feature of art  is its long n terminal extension and two disulfide bridges that are far away from the active center they stabilize the protein against denaturation and presumably also against shearing forces parallel with the membrane where art  is anchored
