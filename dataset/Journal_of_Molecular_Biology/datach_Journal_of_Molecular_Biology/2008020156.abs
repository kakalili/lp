cgmp binding prepares pkg for substrate binding by disclosing the c terminal domain
type i cyclic guanosine      monophosphate cgmp dependent protein kinase pkg is involved in the nitric oxide cgmp signaling pathway pkg has been identified in many different species ranging from unicel lular organisms to mammals the enzyme serves as one of the major receptor proteins for intracellular cgmp and controls a variety of cellular responses ranging from smooth muscle relaxation to neuronal synaptic plasticity in the absence of a crystal structure the three dimensional structure of the homodimeric   kda kinase pkg is unknown however there is evidence that the kinase adopts a distinct cgmp dependent active conformation when compared to the inactive conformation we performed mass spectrometry based hydrogen deuterium exchange experiments to obtain detailed information on the structural changes in pkg i  induced by cgmp activation site specific exchange measurements confirmed that the autoinhibitory domain and the hinge region become more solvent exposed whereas the cgmp binding domains become more protected in holo pkg dimeric pkg saturated with four cgmp molecules bound  more surprisingly our data revealed a specific disclosure of the substrate binding region of holo pkg shedding new light into the kinase activation process of pkg
