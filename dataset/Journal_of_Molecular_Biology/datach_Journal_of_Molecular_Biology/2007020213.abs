the structures of l rhamnose isomerase from pseudomonas stutzeri in complexes with l rhamnose and d allose provide insights into broad substrate specificity
pseudomonas stutzeri l rhamnose isomerase p stutzeri l rhi can efficiently catalyze the isomerization between various aldoses and ketoses showing a broad substrate specificity compared to l rhi from escherichia coli e coli l rhi  to understand the relationship between structure and substrate specificity the crystal structures of p stutzeri l rhi alone and in complexes with l rhamnose and d allose which has different configurations of c and c from l rhamnose were determined at a resolution of          and      respectively p stutzeri l rhi has a large domain with a     barrel fold and an additional small domain composed of seven  helices forming a homo tetramer as found in e coli l rhi and d xylose isomerases d xis from various microorganisms the      loop gly   arg  of p stutzeri l rhi is involved in the substrate binding of a neighbouring molecule as found in d xis while in e coli l rhi the corresponding      loop is extended asp   arg  and covers the substrate binding site of the same molecule the complex structures of p stutzeri l rhi with l rhamnose and d allose show that both substrates are nicely fitted to the substrate binding site the part of the substrate binding site interacting with the substrate at the    and  positions is equivalent to e coli l rhi and the other part interacting with the    and  positions is similar to d xi in e coli l rhi the      loop creates an unique hydrophobic pocket at the the    and  positions leading to the strictly recognition of l rhamnose as the most suitable substrate while in p stutzeri l rhi there is no corresponding hydrophobic pocket where phe  from a neighbouring molecule merely forms hydrophobic interactions with the substrate leading to the loose substrate recognition at the    and  positions
