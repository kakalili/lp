ligand induced conformational change in the minimized insulin receptor edited by a r fersht
within the class of insulin and insulin like growth factor receptors detailed information about the molecular recognition event at the hormone receptor interface is limited by the absence of suitable co crystals we describe the use of a biologically active insulin derivative labeled with the nbd fluorophore b nbd insulin to characterize the mechanism of reversible   complex formation with a fragment of the insulin receptor ectodomain the accompanying   increase in the fluorescence quantum yield of the label provides the basis for a dynamic study of the hormone receptor binding event stopped flow fluorescence experiments show that the kinetics of complex formation are biphasic comprising a bimolecular binding event followed by a conformational change displacement with excess unlabeled insulin gave monophasic kinetics of dissociation the rate data are rationalized in terms of available experiments on mutant receptors and the x ray structure of a non binding fragment of the receptor of the homologous insulin like growth factor igf
