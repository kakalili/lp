three dimensional structure of iminodisuccinate epimerase defines the fold of the mmge prpd protein family
iminodisuccinate ids epimerase catalyzes the epimerisation of r r  s s and r s iminodisuccinate one step in the biodegradation of the chelating agent iminodisuccinate by agrobacterium tumefaciens by  the enzyme is a member of the mmge prpd protein family a diverse and little characterized class of proteins of prokaryotic and eukaryotic origin ids epimerase does not show significant overall amino acid sequence similarity to any other protein of known three dimensional structure the crystal structure of this novel epimerase has been determined by multi wavelength diffraction to     resolution using selenomethionine substituted enzyme in the crystal the enzyme forms a homo dimer and the subunit consists of two domains the larger domain not consecutive in sequence and comprising residues met  lys  and leu   pro   forms a novel all  helical fold with a central six helical bundle the second smaller domain folds into an    domain related in topology to chorismate mutase by a circular permutation ids epimerase is thus not related in three dimensional structure to other known epimerases the fold of the ids epimerase is representative for the whole mmge prpd family the putative active site is located at the interface between the two domains of the subunit and is characterized by a positively charged surface consistent with the binding of a highly negatively charged substrate such as iminodisuccinate docking experiments suggest a two base mechanism for the epimerisation reaction
