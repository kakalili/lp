The interaction of bovine α-lactalbumin (BLA) with negatively charged phospholipid bilayers was studied by NMR monitored 1H exchange to characterize the conformational transition that enables a water-soluble protein to associate with and partially insert into a membrane. BLA was allowed to exchange in deuterated buffer in the absence (reference) and the presence (membrane-bound) of acidic liposomes at pH 4.5, experimental conditions that allow efficient protein–membrane interaction. After adjusting the pH to 6.0, to dissociate the protein from the membrane, reference and membrane-released samples of BLA were analysed by (F1) band-selective homonuclear decoupled total correlation spectroscopy in the αH–NH region. The overall exchange behaviour of the membrane-bound state is molten globule-like, suggesting an overall destabilization of the polypeptide. Nevertheless, the backbone amide protons of residues R10, L12, C77, K94, K98, V99 and W104 show significant protection against solvent exchange in the membrane-bound protein. We propose a mechanism for the association of BLA with negatively charged membranes that includes initial protonation of acidic side-chains at the membrane interface, and formation of an interacting site with the membrane which involves helixes A and C. In the next step these helices would slide away from each other, adopting a parallel orientation to the membrane, and would rotate to maximize the interaction between their hydrophobic residues and the lipid bilayer.
