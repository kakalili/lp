hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry of actin in various biochemical contexts
hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry h d ms of monomeric actin g actin  polymeric actin f actin  phalloidin bound f actin and g actin complexed with dnase i provides new insights into the architecture of f actin and the effects of phalloidin and dnase i binding although the overall pattern of deuteration change supports the gross features of the holmes f actin model two important differences were observed most significantly no change in deuteration was observed in the critical  hydrophobic plug  region suggesting this feature may not be present polymerization also produced deuteration increases for peptide fragments containing the atp phosphate binding loops suggesting g actin transitions to a more  open  conformation upon polymerization however polymerization produced decreases in deuteration mainly localized to the  inner   filament axis side as predicted by the holmes model mapping the phalloidin induced decreases in f actin deuteration onto the lorenz binding site produced a single common patch straddling two monomers across the  start helix contact again consistent with the holmes architecture finally both dnase i and phalloidin were able to alter the deuteration of regions distal to their respective binding sites these results highlight the great opportunities for h d ms to exploit high resolution structures for detailed studies of the organization and dynamics of complex molecular assemblies
