functional role of c   h  o hydrogen bonds between transmembrane  helices in photosystem i
the crystal structure at    resolution of the membrane intrinsic homotrimeric photosystem i psi isolated from the thermophilic cyanobacterium synechococcus elongatus shows that each monomer is composed of  protein subunits of which nine are embedded in the membrane and feature a total of  transmembrane  helices tmh  hence psi provides an ideal case to study  conventional  and c   h  o hydrogen bonds between tmh engaged in intra and intersubunit interactions of the total of  c   h  o hydrogen bonds between tmhs   are intrasubunit and only three are intersubunit the two largest subunits psaa and psab are each folded into  tmhs showing  and  intrasubunit c   h  o hydrogen bonds respectively that are not distributed randomly but many of them flank chlorophyll a chl a co ordinating amino acids suggesting stabilisation of these structural segments as major constituent of the trimerisation domain subunit psal is located next to the  fold axis relating the three monomers of psi psal features a unique number of  intrasubunit c   h  o hydrogen bonds that connect two of its three tmhs but there are no intersubunit c   h  o hydrogen bonds between the three psal of the three intersubunit c   h  o hydrogen bonds two are formed between psaa and psab and one between psab and psam the large number of  c   h  o hydrogen bonds contrasts the  conventional hydrogen bonds indicating that the former and van der waals contacts determine association and orientation of tmhs in psi
