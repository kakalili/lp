asp  determines potassium dependence of a rada recombinase from methanococcus voltae
archaeal rada rad  are close homologues of eukaryal rad  dmc  such recombinases as well as their bacterial reca orthologues form helical nucleoprotein filaments in which a hallmark strand exchange reaction occurs between homologous dna substrates our recent atpase and structure studies on rada recombinase from methanococcus voltae have suggested that not only magnesium but also potassium ions are absorbed at the atpase center potassium but not sodium stimulates the atp hydrolysis reaction with an apparent dissociation constant of    mm the minimal inhibitory effect by   mm nacl further suggests that the protein does not have adequate affinity for sodium the wild type protein s strand exchange activity is also stimulated by potassium with an apparent dissociation constant of    mm we made site directed mutations at the potassium contacting residues glu  and asp   the mutant proteins are expectedly defective in promoting atp hydrolysis similar potassium preference in strand exchange is observed for the e  d and e  k proteins the d  k protein however shows comparable strand exchange efficiencies in the presence of either potassium or sodium crystallized e  d filaments reveal a potassium dependent conformational change similar to what has previously been observed with the wild type protein we interpret these data as suggesting that both atp hydrolysis and dna strand exchange requires accessibility to an  active  conformation similar to the crystallized atpase active form in the presence of atp mg  and k
