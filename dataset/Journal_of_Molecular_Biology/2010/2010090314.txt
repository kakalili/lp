In eubacteria, ribosome recycling factor (RRF) and elongation factor G (EFG) function together to dissociate posttermination ribosomal complexes. Earlier studies, using heterologous factors from Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Escherichia coli revealed that specific interactions between RRF and EFG are crucial for their function in ribosome recycling. Here, we used translation factors from E. coli, Mycobacterium smegmatis and M. tuberculosis, and polysomes from E. coli and M. smegmatis, and employed in vivo and in vitro experiments to further understand the role of EFG in ribosome recycling. We show that E. coli EFG (EcoEFG) recycles E. coli ribosomes with E. coli RRF (EcoRRF), but not with mycobacterial RRFs. Also, EcoEFG fails to recycle M. smegmatis ribosomes with either EcoRRF or mycobacterial RRFs. On the other hand, mycobacterial EFGs recycle both E. coli and M. smegmatis ribosomes with either of the RRFs. These observations suggest that EFG establishes distinct interactions with RRF and the ribosome to carry out ribosome recycling. Furthermore, the EFG chimeras generated by swapping domains between mycobacterial EFGs and EcoEFG suggest that while the residues needed to specify the EFG interaction with RRF are located in domains IV and V, those required to specify its interaction with the ribosome are located throughout the molecule.
