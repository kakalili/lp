structure activity relationships in flexible protein domains regulation of rho gtpases by rhogdi and d gdi edited by p e wright
the guanine dissociation inhibitors rhogdi and d gdi inhibit guanosine   diphosphate dissociation from rho gtpases keeping these small gtpases in an inactive state the gdis are made up of two domains a flexible n terminal domain of about  amino acid residues and a folded   residue c terminal domain here we characterize the conformation of the n terminal regions of both rhogdi and d gdi using a series of nmr experiments which include  n relaxation and amide solvent accessibility measurements in each protein two regions with tendencies to form helices are identified residues  to  and  to  in rhogdi and residues  to  and  to  in d gdi to examine the functional roles of the n terminal domain of rhogdi in vitro and in vivo functional assays have been carried out with n terminally truncated proteins these studies show that the first  amino acid residues are not required for inhibition of gdp dissociation but appear to be important for gtp hydrolysis whilst removal of the first  residues completely abolish the ability of rhogdi to inhibit gdp dissociation the combination of structural and functional studies allows us to explain why rhogdi and d gdi are able to interact in similar ways with the guanosine   diphosphate bound gtpase but differ in their ability to regulate gtp bound forms these functional differences are attributed to the conformational differences of the n terminal domains of the guanosine   diphosphate dissociation inhibitors therefore the two transient helices appear to be associated with different biological effects of rhogdi providing a clear example of structure activity relationships in a flexible protein domain
