The GroES protein from Escherichia coli is a well-known member of the molecular chaperones. GroES consists of seven identical 10 kDa subunits, and forms a dome-like oligomeric structure. In order to obtain information on the structural stability and unfolding–refolding mechanism of GroES protein, especially at protein concentrations (0.4–1.2 mM GroES monomer) that would mimic heat stress conditions in vivo, we have performed synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments. Surprisingly, in spite of the high protein concentration, reversibility in the unfolding–refolding reaction was confirmed by SAXS experiments structurally. Although the unfolding–refolding reaction showed an apparent single transition with a Cm of 1.1 M guanidium hydrochloride, a more detailed analysis of this transition demonstrated that the unfolding mechanism could be best explained by a sequential three-state model, which consists of native heptamer, dissociated monomer, and unfolded monomer. Together with our previous result that GroES unfolded completely via a partially folded monomer according to a three-state model at low protein concentration (5 μM monomer), the unfolding–refolding mechanism of GroES protein could be explained uniformly by the three-state model from low to high protein concentrations. Furthermore, to clarify an ambiguity of the native GroES structure in solution, especially mobile loop structures, we have estimated a solution structure of GroES using SAXS profiles obtained from experiments and simulation analysis. The result suggested that the native structure of GroES in solution was very similar to that seen in GroES–GroEL complex determined by crystallography.
