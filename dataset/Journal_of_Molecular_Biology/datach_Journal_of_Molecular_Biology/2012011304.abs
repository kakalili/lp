challenging packaging limits and infectivity of phage
the terminase motors of bacteriophages have been shown to be among the strongest active machines in the biomolecular world being able to package several tens of kilobase pairs of viral genome into a capsid within minutes yet these motors are hindered at the end of the packaging process by the progressive buildup of a force resisting packaging associated with already packaged dna in this experimental work we raise the issue of what sets the upper limit on the length of the genome that can be packaged by the terminase motor of phage  and still yield infectious virions and the conditions under which this can be efficiently performed using a packaging strategy developed in our laboratory of building phage  from scratch together with plaque assay monitoring we have been able to show that the terminase motor of phage  is able to produce infectious particles with up to   of the wild type  dna length however the phage production rate and thus the infectivity decreased exponentially with increasing dna length and was a factor of   lower for the     dna phage interestingly our in vitro strategy was still efficient in fully packaging phages with dna lengths as high as   of the wild type length but these viruses were unable to infect bacterial cells efficiently further we demonstrated that the phage production rate is modulated by the presence of multivalent ionic species the biological consequences of these findings are discussed
