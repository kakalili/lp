jktbp is involved in stabilization and ires dependent translation of nrf mrnas by binding to   and   untranslated regions
heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein d like protein jktbp  was implicated in cap independent translation by binding to the internal ribosome entry site in the   untranslated region utr of nf  b repressing factor nrf  two different nrf mrnas have been identified so far both sharing the common   internal ribosome entry site but having different length of   utrs here we used a series of dna and rna luciferase reporter constructs comprising      or both nrf utrs to study the effect of jktbp on translation of nrf mrna variants the results indicate that jktbp regulates the level of nrf protein expression by binding to both nrf   and   utrs using successive deletion and point mutations as well as rna binding studies we define two distinct jktbp binding elements in nrf   and   utrs furthermore jktbp requires two distinct rna binding domains to interact with nrf utrs and a short c terminal region for its effect on nrf expression together our study shows that jktbp contributes to nrf protein expression via two disparate mechanisms mrna stabilization and cap independent translation by binding to   utr jktbp increases the internal translation initiation in both nrf mrna variants whereas its binding to   utr elevated primarily the stability of the major nrf mrna thus jktbp is a key regulatory factor linking two pivotal control mechanisms of nrf gene expression the cap independent translation initiation and mrna stabilization
