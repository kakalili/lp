transcription processing at  n ethenoguanine by human rna polymerase ii and bacteriophage t rna polymerase
the dna lesion  n ethenoguanine  n  g is formed endogenously as a by product of lipid peroxidation or by reaction with epoxides that result from the metabolism of the industrial pollutant vinyl chloride a known human carcinogen dna replication past  n  g and site specific mutagenesis studies on mammalian cells have established the highly mutagenic and genotoxic properties of the damaged base however there is as yet no information on the processing of this lesion during transcription here we report the results of transcription past a site specifically modified  n  g dna template this lesion contains an exocyclic ring obstructing the watson  crick hydrogen bonding edge of guanine our results show that  n  g acts as a partial block to the bacteriophage t rna polymerase rnap  which allows nucleotide incorporation in the growing rna with the selectivity a gt g gt c   deletion  u in contrast  n  g poses an absolute block to human rnap ii elongation and nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion is not observed computer modeling studies show that the more open active site of t rnap allows lesion bypass when the  n  g adopts the syn conformation this orientation places the exocyclic ring in a collision free empty pocket of the polymerase and the observed base incorporation preferences are in agreement with hydrogen bonding possibilities between the incoming nucleotides and the hoogsteen edge of the lesion on the other hand in the more crowded active site of the human rnap ii the modeling studies show that both syn and anti conformations of the  n  g are sterically impermissible polymerase stalling is currently believed to trigger the transcription coupled nucleotide excision repair machinery thus our data suggest that this repair pathway is likely engaged in the clearance of the  n  g from actively transcribed dna
