two active site tyrosyl residues of protein trwc act sequentially at the origin of transfer during plasmid r  conjugation edited by j karn
protein trwc is the relaxase helicase responsible for the initiation and termination reactions of dna processing during plasmid r  conjugation site directed mutagenesis was used to change to phenylalanine each of a set of four conserved tyrosyl residues in the sequence of the n terminal relaxation domain of the protein simultaneous mutation of both y  and y  was required to abolish in vitro cleavage and strand transfer reactions catalyzed by protein trwc on oligonucleotides containing the nic site thus both y  and y  could be involved independently in the formation of oligonucleotide protein covalent complexes that constitute presumed intermediates of these reactions this hypothesis was confirmed by the observation of y  and y  specific peptide oligonucleotide adducts after protease digestion of trwc and mutant derivatives finally mutation y f but not mutation y f abolished nic cleavage of a supercoiled dna containing the r  origin of transfer orit  these data allowed the construction of a model for conjugative dna processing in which y  specifically catalyzes the initial cleavage reaction while y  is used for the second strand transfer reaction which terminates conjugation the model suggests a control mechanism that can be effective at each conjugative replication cycle
