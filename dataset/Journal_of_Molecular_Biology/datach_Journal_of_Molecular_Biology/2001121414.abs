dynamic association of trigger factor with protein substrates edited by c r matthews
trigger factor is a ribosome bound folding helper which apparently combines two functions chaperoning of nascent proteins and catalyzing prolyl isomerization in their folding immediate chaperone binding at the ribosome might interfere with rapid protein folding reactions and we find that trigger factor indeed retards the in vitro folding of a protein with native prolyl isomers the kinetic analysis of trigger factor binding to a refolding protein reveals that the adverse effects of trigger factor on conformational folding are minimized by rapid binding and release the complex between trigger factor and a substrate protein is thus very short lived and fast folding proteins can escape efficiently from an accidental interaction with trigger factor protein chains with incorrect prolyl isomers cannot complete folding and therefore can rebind for further rounds of catalysis unlike dnak trigger factor interacts with substrate proteins in a nucleotide independent binding reaction which seems to be optimized for high catalytic activity rather than for chaperone function the synthetic lethality observed when the genes for both dnak and trigger factor are disrupted might result from an indirect linkage in the absence of trigger factor folding is retarded and more aggregates form which can neither be prevented nor disposed of when dnak is lacking as well
