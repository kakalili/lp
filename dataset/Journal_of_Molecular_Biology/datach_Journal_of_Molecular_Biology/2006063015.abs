the asymmetric isca homodimer with an exposed  fe s cluster suggests the structural basis of the fe s cluster biosynthetic scaffold
it has been shown that the so called scaffold proteins are vital in fe s cluster biosynthesis by providing an intermediate site for the assembly of fe s clusters however since no structural information on such scaffold proteins with bound fe s cluster intermediates is available the structural basis of the core of fe s cluster biosynthesis remains poorly understood here we report the first fe s cluster bound crystal structure of a scaffold protein isca from thermosynechococcus elongatus which carries three strictly conserved cysteine residues surprisingly one partially exposed  fe s cluster is coordinated by two conformationally distinct isca protomers termed  and   with asymmetric cysteinyl ligation by cys  cys   cys  from  and cys  from   in the crystal two   dimers form an unusual domain swapped tetramer via central domains of  protomers together with additional biochemical data supporting its physiologically relevant configuration we propose that the unique asymmetric fe s cluster coordination and the resulting distinct conformational stabilities of the two isca protomers are central to the function of isca type fe s cluster biosynthetic scaffold
