structural basis for catalysis of a tetrameric class iia fructose   bisphosphate aldolase from mycobacterium tuberculosis
mycobacterium tuberculosis the causative agent of tuberculosis tb  currently infects one third of the world s population in its latent form the emergence of multidrug resistant and extensive drug resistant strains has highlighted the need for new pharmacological targets within m tuberculosis the class iia fructose   bisphosphate aldolase fba enzyme from m tuberculosis mtfba has been proposed as one such target since it is upregulated in latent tb since the structure of mtfba has not been determined and there is little information available on its reaction mechanism we sought to determine the x ray structure of mtfba in complex with its substrates by lowering the ph of the enzyme in the crystalline state we were able to determine a series of high resolution x ray structures of mtfba bound to dihydroxyacetone phosphate glyceraldehyde  phosphate and fructose   bisphosphate at      and     respectively through these structures it was discovered that mtfba belongs to a novel tetrameric class of type iia fbas the molecular details at the interface of the tetramer revealed important information for better predictability of the quaternary structures among the fbas based on their primary sequences these x ray structures also provide interesting and new details on the reaction mechanism of class ii fbas substrates and products were observed in geometries poised for catalysis in addition unexpectedly the hydroxyl  enolate intermediate of dihydroxyacetone phosphate was also captured and resolved structurally these concise new details offer a better understanding of the reaction mechanisms for fbas in general and provide a structural basis for inhibitor design efforts aimed at this class of enzymes
