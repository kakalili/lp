structural basis for rangtp independent entry of spliceosomal u snrnps into the nucleus
the nuclear import of assembled spliceosomal subunits the uridine rich small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles u snrnps  is mediated by a nuclear import receptor adaptor couple of importin  imp  and snurportin  spn  in contrast to any other characterized active nuclear import the imp  spn u snrnp complex does not require rangtp for the terminal release from the nuclear basket of the nuclear pore complex npc  the crystal structure of imp        in complex with the imp  binding ibb domain of spn      at    resolution reveals that imp  adopts an open conformation which is unique for a functional imp  cargo complex and rather surprisingly it resembles the conformation of the imp  rangtp complex as binding of rangtp to imp  usually triggers the release of import complexes from the npc we propose that by already mimicking a conformation similar to imp  rangtp the independent dissociation of imp  spn from the nuclear basket is energetically aided
