identifying assembly inhibiting and assembly tolerant sites in the sbsb s layer protein from geobacillus stearothermophilus
surface layer s layer proteins self assemble into two dimensional crystalline lattices that cover the cell wall of all archaea and many bacteria we have generated assembly negative protein variants of high solubility that will facilitate high resolution structure determination assembly negative versions of the s layer protein sbsb from geobacillus stearothermophilus pv  p were obtained using an insertion mutagenesis screen the haemagglutinin epitope tag was inserted at  amino acid positions known to be located on the monomer protein surface from a previous cysteine accessibility screen limited proteolysis circular dichroism and fluorescence were used to probe whether the epitope insertion affected the secondary and tertiary structures of the monomer while electron microscopy and size exclusion chromatography were employed to examine proteins ability to self assemble the screen not only identified assembly compromised mutants with native fold but also yielded correctly folded self assembling mutants suitable for displaying epitopes for biomedical and biophysical applications as well as cryo electron microscopy imaging our study marks an important step in the analysis of the s layer structure in addition the approach of concerted insertion and cysteine mutagenesis can likely be applied for other supramolecular assemblies
