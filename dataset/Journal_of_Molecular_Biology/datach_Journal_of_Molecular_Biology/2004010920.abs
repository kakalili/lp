mosa a protein implicated in rhizopine biosynthesis in sinorhizobium meliloti l   is a dihydrodipicolinate synthase
mosa is a gene product encoded on a psym megaplasmid of sinorhizobium meliloti l   the gene is part of an operon reported to be essential for the synthesis of the rhizopine  o methyl scyllo inosamine mosa has been assigned the function of an o methyltransferase however the reported sequence of this protein is very much like that of dihydrodipicolinate synthase dhdps  except for a  amino acid residue c terminal domain this similarity contradicts accepted ideas regarding structure  function relationships of enzymes we have cloned and overexpressed the recombinant gene in escherichia coli and discovered that the reported sequence contains an error resulting in a frame shift the correct sequence contains a new stop codon truncating the c terminal  amino acid residues of the reported sequence the expressed protein bearing an n terminal polyhistidine tag catalyzes the condensation of pyruvate and aspartate  semialdehyde efficiently suggesting that this activity is not a side reaction but an activity for which this enzyme has evolved electro spray mass spectrometry experiments and inhibition by l lysine are consistent with the enzyme being a dhdps e coli at   a mutant host normally requiring exogenous diaminopimelate for growth could be complemented by transformation with a plasmid bearing the gene encoding mosa a role for this enzyme in rhizopine synthesis cannot be ruled out but is called into question
