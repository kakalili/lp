The potential utility of catalytic RNAs and DNAs (ribozymes and deoxyribozymes, respectively) as reagents in molecular biology as well as therapeutic agents for a variety of human diseases, has long been recognized. Although naturally occurring RNA-cleaving ribozymes are typically not subject to feedback control, rational methodologies for the creation of allosteric ribozymes, by functional combination of ribozyme and ligand-responsive aptamer RNA elements, have existed for some years. Here, we report the in vitro selection of RNA aptamers specific for binding one but not the other of two light-induced isomers of a dihydropyrene photo-switch compound, and the utilization of such an aptamer for the construction of the UG-dihydropyrene ribozyme, an allosteric hammerhead ribozyme whose catalysis is controllable by irradiation with visible versus ultraviolet light. In the presence of micromolar concentrations of the photo-switch compound, the ribozyme behaves as a two-state switch, exhibiting a &gt;900-fold difference in catalytic rates between the two irradiation regimes. We anticipate that the UG-dihydropyrene, and other ribozymes like it, may find significant application in the developmental biology of model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, as well as in the biomedical sciences.
