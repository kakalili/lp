Here, we discuss the relationship between protein sequence and protein structural similarity. It is established that a protein structural distance (PSD) of 2.0 is a threshold above which two proteins are unlikely to have a detectable pairwise sequence relationship. A precise correlation is established between the level of sequence similarity, defined by a normalized Smith-Waterman score, and the probability that two proteins will have a similar structure (defined by pairwise PSD&lt;2). This correlation can be used in evaluating the likelihood for success in a comparative modeling procedure. We establish the existence of a correlation between sequence and structural similarity for pairs of proteins that are related in structure but whose sequence relationship is not detectable using standard pairwise sequence alignments. Although it is well known that there is a close relationship between sequence and structural similarity for pairwise sequence identities greater than about 30 %, there has been little discussion as to the possible existence of such a relationship for pairs of proteins in or below the twilight zone of sequence similarity (&lt;25 % pairwise sequence identity). Possible implications of our results for the evolution of protein structure are discussed.
