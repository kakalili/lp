multimeric interactions between complement factor h and its c d ligand provide new insight on complement regulation
activation of c to c b signals the start of the alternative complement pathway the c terminal short complement regulator scr   domain of factor h fh  the major serum regulator of c b possesses a binding site for c d a  kda physiological fragment of c b size distribution analyses of mixtures of scr    or fh with c d by analytical ultracentrifugation in  and   mm nacl buffer revealed a range of discrete peaks showing that multimeric complexes had formed at physiologically relevant concentrations surface plasmon resonance studies showed that native fh binds c d in two stages an equilibrium dissociation constant kd of    m in physiological buffer was determined for the first stage overlay experiments indicated that c d formed multimeric complexes with fh x ray scattering showed that the maximum dimension of the c d complexes with scr    at   nm was not much longer than that of the unbound scr    dimer molecular modelling suggested that the ultracentrifugation and scattering data are most simply explained in terms of associating dimers of each of scr    and c d we conclude that the physiological interaction between fh and c d is not a simple   binding stoichiometry between the two proteins that is often assumed because the multimers involve the c terminus of fh which is bound to host cell surfaces our results provide new insight on fh regulation during excessive complement activation both in the fluid phase and at host cell surfaces decorated by c d
