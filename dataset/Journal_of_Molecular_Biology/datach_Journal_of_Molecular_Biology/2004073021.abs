topological measurement of an a tract bend angle effect of magnesium
sequences of four to six adenine residues termed a tracts have been shown to produce curvature in the dna double helix a tracts have been used extensively as reference standards to quantify bending induced by other sequences as well as by dna binding proteins when they bind to their sites however the ability of an a tract to serve as such a standard is hampered by the wide variation of values reported for the amount of bend conferred by an a tract one experimental condition that differs in these studies is the presence of divalent cation to evaluate this effect a new application of a topological method termed rotational variant analysis is used here to measure for the first time the effect of the presence of magnesium ion on the bend angle conferred by an a tract this method which has the unique ability to measure a bend angle in the presence or absence of magnesium ion demonstrates that magnesium ion markedly increases the bend angle for example when measured in a commonly used gel electrophoretic buffer the bend angle conferred by a tract of six adenine residues increases from about   in the absence of magnesium ion to   in the presence of   mm magnesium ion this quantitative demonstration of substantial magnesium ion dependence has several important implications first it explains discrepancies among bend values reported in various previous studies particularly those employing gel electrophoretic versus other solution methods in addition these findings necessitate substantial revisions of the conclusions in a large number of studies that have used a tract dna as the bend angle reference standard in comparison measurements finally any such future studies employing this comparison methodology will need to use the same sequence analyzed in the original measurements as well as replicate the original measurement conditions e g ionic composition and temperature
