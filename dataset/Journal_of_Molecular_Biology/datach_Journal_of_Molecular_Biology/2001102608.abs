mutational analysis of hydrogen bonding residues in the bpti folding pathway edited by c r matthews
nine bpti variants with replacements that remove one or more hydrogen bonds from the native protein were constructed and the folding pathways of these proteins were determined by isolating and identifying the disulfide bonded intermediates that accumulated during unfolding and refolding the forward and reverse rate constants for the individual steps in the folding pathways for each protein were measured providing a detailed description of the energetic effects of the substitutions the native forms of eight of the nine variants were measurably destabilized by    kcal mol  cal     j  with an average effect of   kcal mol per hydrogen bond removed the folding pathways for the variants were found to be similar to that previously described for the wild type protein with the kinetically preferred mechanism involving intramolecular rearrangements of intermediates with two disulfide bonds some of the substitutions however significantly destabilized the major intermediates and broadened the distribution of species with one or two disulfide bonds thus identifying residues that play important roles in stabilizing the normal intermediates and defining specificity in the folding process the kinetic data also suggest that one residue asn  may play a distinctive role in defining the bpti folding mechanism replacement of this residue with either gly or ala appeared to stabilize the major transition states for folding and unfolding in the native protein the side chain of asn  participates directly in the hydrogen bonding pattern of the central  sheet and the kinetic behavior of the asn  variants suggests that the major energy barriers in folding and unfolding may be due in part to the steric constraints imposed by this structural element together with those imposed by the chemical transition states for thiol disulfide exchange
