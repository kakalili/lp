structure of poia  a homologous protein to the propeptide of subtilisin implication for protein foldability and the function as an intramolecular chaperone edited by r huber
solution structure of poia  pleurotus ostreatus proteinase a inhibitor   which functions as an intramolecular chaperone and as an inhibitor to subtilisin was determined by making use of the fact that poia is the only structured protein that shows homology to the propeptide of subtilisin which is unstructured by itself foldability of this protein was elucidated it became clear that the evolutionarily conserved residues play two important roles one for the maintenance of its own structure and the other for the interaction with subtilisin structural softness and mutational tolerance contained in the poia structure makes it an ideal material for designing a foldable protein
