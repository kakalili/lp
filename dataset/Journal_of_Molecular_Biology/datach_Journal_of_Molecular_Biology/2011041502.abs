inhibition of escherichia coli rnap by t gp protein role of negatively charged strip of amino acid residues in gp
gp  a  kda protein encoded by t bacteriophage is a potent inhibitor of escherichia coli rna polymerase rnap  the enzyme responsible for transcription of all bacterial genes and early viral genes a prominent feature in the structure of gp is a contiguous strip of seven negatively charged amino acid residues negatively charged strip or ncs  located along one side of the molecule the role of the ncs in gp function is not known here the in vivo and in vitro properties of altered forms of gp with amino acid substitutions in the ncs are described while mutations in the ncs do not compromise the folding or the ability of gp to bind to the rnap    subunit disruption of the ncs significantly attenuates gp function in vivo and its ability to inhibit rnap in vitro efficient inhibition of the rnap by gp also involves the amino terminal region  domain of the rnap promoter specificity subunit    located in the vicinity of the primary gp binding site in    the results are discussed in the context of hypothetical molecular mechanisms of rnap inhibition by gp
