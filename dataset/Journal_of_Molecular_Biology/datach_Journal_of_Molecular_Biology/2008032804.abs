functional characterization of recombinant prefoldin complexes from a hyperthermophilic archaeon thermococcus sp strain ks
prefoldin is a heterohexameric molecular chaperone complex that is found in the eukaryotic cytosol and also in archaea it captures a nonnative protein and subsequently delivers it to a group ii chaperonin for proper folding archaeal prefoldin is a heterocomplex containing two  subunits and four  subunits with the structure of a double  barrel assembly with six long coiled coils protruding from it like a jellyfish with six tentacles we have studied the protein folding mechanism of group ii chaperonin using those of thermococcus sp strain ks  t ks  because they exhibit high protein folding activity in vitro we have also demonstrated functional cooperation between t ks  chaperonins and prefoldin from pyrococcus horikoshii ot  recent genome analysis has shown that thermococcus kodakaraensis kod contains two pairs of prefoldin subunit genes correlating with the existence of two different chaperonin subunits in this study we characterized four different recombinant prefoldin complexes composed of two pairs of prefoldin subunits         and   from t ks  all of them                  and      exist as    heterohexamers and can protect several proteins from forming aggregates with different activities we have also compared the collaborative activity between the prefoldin complexes and the cognate chaperonins prefoldin complexes containing the   subunit interacted with the chaperonins more strongly than those with the   subunit the results suggest that thermococcus spp express different prefoldins for different substrates or conditions as chaperonins
