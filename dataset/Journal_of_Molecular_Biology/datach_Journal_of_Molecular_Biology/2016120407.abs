the continuing mystery of lipid rafts
since its initial formalization nearly  years ago the concept of lipid rafts has generated a tremendous amount of attention and interest and nearly as much controversy the controversy is perhaps surprising because the notion itself is intuitive compartmentalization in time and space is a ubiquitous theme at all scales of biology and therefore the partitioning of cellular membranes into lateral subdivision should be expected nevertheless the physicochemical principles responsible for compartmentalization and the molecular mechanisms by which they are functionalized remain nearly as mysterious today as they were two decades ago herein we review recent literature on this topic with a specific focus on the major open questions in the field including   what are the best tools to assay raft behavior in living membranes   what is the function of the complex lipidome of mammalian cells with respect to membrane organization   what are the mechanisms that drive raft formation and determine their properties   how can rafts be modulated   how is membrane compartmentalization integrated into cellular signaling despite decades of intensive research this compelling field remains full of fundamental questions
