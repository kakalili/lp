observation of additional calcium ion in the crystal structure of the triple mutant k     m of bovine pancreatic phospholipase a
phospholipase a catalyses hydrolysis of the ester bond at the c position of  sn phosphoglycerides here we report the    resolution crystal structure of the triple mutant k     m of bovine pancreatic phospholipase a  the structure was solved by molecular replacement method using the orthorhombic form of the recombinant phospholipase a  the final protein model contains all the   amino acid residues two calcium ions   water molecules and one  methyl   pentanediol molecule the model has been refined to a crystallographic r factor of    rfree of    for all data between    and    the residues     which are in a surface loop are always disordered in the structures of bovine pancreatic phospholipase a and its mutants it is interesting to note that the residues     in the present structure is ordered and the conformation varies substantially from those in the previously published structures of this enzyme an unexpected and interesting observation in the present structure is that in addition to the functionally important calcium ion in the active site one more calcium ion is found near the n terminus detailed structural analyses suggest that binding of the second calcium ion could be responsible for the conformational change and the ordering of the surface loop furthermore the results suggest a structural reciprocity between the kcat  allosteric site and surface loop at the i face which represents a newly identified structural property of secreted phospholipase a
