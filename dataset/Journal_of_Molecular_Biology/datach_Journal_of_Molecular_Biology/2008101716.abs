formation of toxic a      fibrils on gm ganglioside containing membranes mimicking lipid rafts polymorphisms in a      fibrils
the abnormal aggregation and deposition of amyloid  protein a  on neuronal cells are critical to the onset of alzheimer s disease the entity oligomers or fibrils of toxic a  species responsible for the pathogenesis of the disease has been controversial we have reported that the a  aggregates on ganglioside rich domains of neuronal pc  cells as well as in raft like model membranes here we identified toxic a      aggregates formed with gm ganglioside containing membranes a      was incubated with raft like liposomes composed of gm cholesterol sphingomyelin at    and    c after a lag period toxic amyloid fibrils with a width of   nm were formed and subsequently laterally assembled with slight changes in their secondary structure as confirmed by viability assay thioflavin t fluorescence circular dichroism and transmission electron microscopy in striking contrast a  fibrils formed without membranes were thinner    nm and much less toxic because of weaker binding to cell membranes and a smaller surface hydrophobicity this study suggests that toxic a      species formed on membranes are not soluble oligomers but amyloid fibrils and that a      fibrils exhibit polymorphisms
