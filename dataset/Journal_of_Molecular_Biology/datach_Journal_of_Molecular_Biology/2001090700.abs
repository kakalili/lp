rna folding pathway functional intermediates their prediction and analysis edited by i tinoco
the massively parallel genetic algorithm ga for rna structure prediction uses the concepts of mutation recombination and survival of the fittest to evolve a population of thousands of possible rna structures toward a solution structure as described below the properties of the algorithm are ideally suited to use in the prediction of possible folding pathways and functional intermediates of rna molecules given their sequences utilizing stem trace an interactive visualization tool for rna structure comparison analysis of not only the solution ensembles developed by the algorithm but also the stages of development of each of these solutions can give strong insight into these folding pathways the ga allows the incorporation of information from biological experiments making it possible to test the influence of particular interactions between structural elements on the dynamics of the folding pathway these methods are used to reveal the folding pathways of the potato spindle tuber viroid pstvd and the host killing mechanism of escherichia coli plasmid r  both of which are successfully explored through the combination of the ga and stem trace we also present novel intermediate folds of each molecule which appear to be phylogenetically supported as determined by use of the methods described below
