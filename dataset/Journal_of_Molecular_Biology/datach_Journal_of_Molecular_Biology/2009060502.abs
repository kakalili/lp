topologies of complexes containing o alkylguanine  dna alkyltransferase and dna
the mutagenic and cytotoxic effects of many alkylating agents are reduced by o alkylguanine  dna alkyltransferase agt  in humans this protein not only protects the integrity of the genome but also contributes to the resistance of tumors to dna alkylating chemotherapeutic agents here we describe and test models for cooperative multiprotein complexes of agt with single stranded and duplex dnas that are based on in vitro binding data and the crystal structure of a   agt  dna complex these models predict that cooperative assemblies contain a three start helical array of proteins with dominant protein  protein interactions between the amino terminal face of protein n and the carboxy terminal face of protein n  and they predict that binding duplex dna does not require large changes in b form dna geometry experimental tests using protein cross linking analyzed by mass spectrometry electrophoretic and analytical ultracentrifugation binding assays and topological analyses with closed circular dna show that the properties of multiprotein agt  dna complexes are consistent with these predictions
