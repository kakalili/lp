gaining target access for deoxyribozymes
antisense oligonucleotides and ribozymes have been used widely to regulate gene expression by targeting mrnas in a sequence specific manner long rnas however are highly structured molecules thus up to   of putative cleavage sites have been shown to be inaccessible to classical rna based ribozymes or dnazymes here we report the use of modified nucleotides to overcome barriers raised by internal structures of the target rna in our attempt to cleave a broad range of picornavirus rnas we generated a dnazyme against a highly conserved sequence in the   untranslated region    utr  while this dnazyme was highly efficient against the   utr of the human rhinovirus   it failed to cleave the identical target sequence within the rna of the related coxsackievirus a  cav   after introduction of   o methyl rna or locked nucleic acid lna monomers into the substrate recognition arms the dnazyme degraded the previously inaccessible virus rna at a high catalytic rate even to completion indicating that nucleotides with high target affinity were able to compete successfully with internal structures we then adopted this strategy to two dnazymes that we had found to be inactive in our earlier experiments the modified dnazymes proved to be highly effective against their respective target structures our approach may be useful for other ribozyme strategies struggling with accessibility problems especially when being restricted to unique target sites
