filling in void and sparse regions in protein sequence space by protein like artificial sequences enables remarkable enhancement in remote homology detection capability
protein functional annotation relies on the identification of accurate relationships sequence divergence being a key factor this is especially evident when distant protein relationships are demonstrated only with three dimensional structures to address this challenge we describe a computational approach to purposefully bridge gaps between related protein families through directed design of protein like  linker  sequences for this we represented scop domain families integrated with sequence homologues as multiple profiles and performed hmm hmm alignments between related domain families where convincing alignments were achieved we applied a roulette wheel based method to design      protein like sequences corresponding to   scop folds to analyze their ability to link proteins in homology searches we used   queries to search two databases one containing only natural sequences and another one additionally containing designed sequences our results showed that augmented database searches showed up to   improvement in fold coverage for over   of the folds with  folds achieving all theoretically possible connections although sequences could not be designed between some families the availability of designed sequences between other families within the fold established the sequence continuum to demonstrate   difficult relationships ultimately as a practical and realistic extension we demonstrate that such protein like sequences can be  plugged into  routine and generic sequence database searches to empower not only remote homology detection but also fold recognition our richly statistically supported findings show that complementary searches in both databases will increase the effectiveness of sequence based searches in recognizing all homologues sharing a common fold
