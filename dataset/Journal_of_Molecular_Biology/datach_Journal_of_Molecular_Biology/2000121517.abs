ph dependent self association of influenza hemagglutinin fusion peptides in lipid bilayers
we have recently designed a host guest peptide system that allows us to quantitatively measure the energetics of interaction of viral fusion peptides with lipid bilayers here we show that fusion peptides of influenza hemagglutinin reversibly associate with one another at membrane surfaces above critical surface concentrations which range from one to five peptides per   lipids in the systems that we investigated it is further demonstrated by using circular dichroism and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy that monomeric peptides insert into the bilayers in a predominantly  helical conformation whereas self associated fusion peptides adopt predominantly antiparallel  sheet structures at the membrane surface the two forms are readily interconvertible and the equilibrium between them is determined by the ph and ionic strength of the surrounding solution lowering the ph favors the monomeric  helical conformation whereas increasing the ionic strength shifts the equilibrium towards the membrane associated  aggregates the binding data are interpreted in terms of a cooperative binding model that yields free energies of insertion and free energies of self association for each of the peptides studied at ph   and ph   at ph  and  mm ionic strength the insertion energy of the  residue influenza hemagglutinin fusion peptide is    kcal mol and the self association energy is    kcal mol we propose that self association of fusion peptides could be a major driving force for recruiting a small number of hemagglutinin trimers into a fusion site
