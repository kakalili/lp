visualizing the disassembly of s cerevisiae rad  nucleoprotein filaments
rad  is the core component of the eukaryotic homologous recombination machinery and assembles into elongated nucleoprotein filaments on dna we have used total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and a dna curtain assay to investigate the dynamics of individual saccharomyces cerevisiae rad  nucleoprotein filaments for these experiments the dna molecules were end labeled with single fluorescent semiconducting nanocrystals the assembly and disassembly of the rad  nucleoprotein filaments were visualized by tracking the location of the labeled dna end in real time using this approach we have analyzed yeast rad  under a variety of different reaction conditions to assess parameters that impact the stability of the nucleoprotein filament we show that rad  readily dissociates from dna in the presence of adp or in the absence of nucleotide cofactor but that free atp in solution confers a fivefold increase in the stability of the nucleoprotein filaments we also probe how protein dissociation is coupled to atp binding and hydrolysis by examining the effects of atp concentration and by the use of the nonhydrolyzable atp analogue adenosine   beta gamma imido triphosphate and atpase active site mutants finally we demonstrate that the rad  gain of function mutant i  t dissociates from dna with kinetics nearly identical to that of wild type rad  but assembles   more rapidly together these results provide a framework for studying the biochemical behaviors of s cerevisiae rad  nucleoprotein filaments at the single molecule level
