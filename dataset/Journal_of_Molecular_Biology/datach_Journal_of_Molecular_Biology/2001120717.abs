modifying the specificity of an rna backbone contact edited by d e draper
the interaction between the ms bacteriophage coat protein homodimer and its cognate rna hairpin is facilitated by  different rna protein contacts in one of these contacts the   hydroxyl group at ribose   of the rna acts as a hydrogen bond donor to glu  in one subunit of the protein previous experiments showed that substitution of ribose   with deoxyribose resulted in a  fold decrease in binding affinity between rna and protein using a protein where the two ms monomers were fused to increase stability the contribution of this contact to the overall binding affinity was investigated by site directed mutagenesis when glu  was substituted with glutamine aspartate or alanine the binding affinity of the hairpin for the protein was weakened by  to   fold similar to that observed with deoxyribose at position    however the specificity of the three mutant proteins for rnas with various modifications at the   position of ribose   differed dramatically while the glu asp protein resembled the wild type protein in preferring the   hydroxyl group over a proton or a bulky   substituent both the glu ala and glu gln proteins preferred bulky   substituents over the   hydroxyl group by more than   fold these experiments emphasize the ease with which the specificity of a protein nucleic acid interaction can be changed at thermodynamically important sites
