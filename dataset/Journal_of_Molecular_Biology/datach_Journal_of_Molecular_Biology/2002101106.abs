native like mean structure in the unfolded ensemble of small proteins
the nature of the unfolded state plays a great role in our understanding of proteins however accurately studying the unfolded state with computer simulation is difficult due to its complexity and the great deal of sampling required using a supercluster of over    processors we have performed close to   s of molecular dynamics simulation in atomistic detail of the folded and unfolded states of three polypeptides from a range of structural classes the all alpha villin headpiece molecule the beta hairpin tryptophan zipper and a designed alpha beta zinc finger mimic a comparison between the folded and the unfolded ensembles reveals that even though virtually none of the individual members of the unfolded ensemble exhibits native like features the mean unfolded structure averaged over the entire unfolded ensemble has a native like geometry this suggests several novel implications for protein folding and structure prediction as well as new interpretations for experiments which find structure in ensemble averaged measurements
