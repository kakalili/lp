mdl is a high copy suppressor of atm  evidence for a role in resistance to oxidative stress
the yeast atm gene is essential for normal cellular iron homeostasis deletion of atm results in mitochondrial iron accumulation and increased sensitivity to oxidative stress and transition metal toxicity atm p is an atp binding cassette abc transporter localized to the mitochondrial inner membrane the specific function of atm p has not been determined though roles in both mitochondrial iron export and cytosolic fe  s cluster assembly have been proposed we undertook a screen for yeast genes capable of suppressing the abnormalities of cellular iron metabolism demonstrated by  atm cells one of the genes we identified was mdl  which like atm  encodes a mitochondrial inner membrane abc transporter mdl p has previously been shown to function in the export of peptides from the mitochondrial matrix we demonstrate that over expression of mdl in  atm cells results in a reduction of mitochondrial iron content and decreased sensitivity to h o and transition metal toxicity additionally in studies of the effect of over expression and deletion of mdl  we have identified a novel role for mdl p in the regulation of cellular resistance to oxidative stress
