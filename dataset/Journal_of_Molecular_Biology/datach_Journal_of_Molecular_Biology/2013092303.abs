structure of the pseudorabies virus capsid comparison with herpes simplex virus type  and differential binding of essential minor proteins
the structure of pseudorabies virus prv capsids isolated from the nucleus of infected cells and from prv virions was determined by cryo electron microscopy cryo em and compared to herpes simplex virus type  hsv  capsids prv capsid structures closely resemble those of hsv  including distribution of the capsid vertex specific component cvsc of hsv  which is a heterodimer of the pul  and pul  proteins occupancy of cvsc on all prv capsids is near    compared to   reported for hsv  c capsids and   or less that we measure for hsv  a and b capsids a prv mutant lacking pul  does not produce c capsids and lacks visible cvsc density in the cryo em based reconstruction a reconstruction of prv capsids in which green fluorescent protein was fused within the n terminus of pul  confirmed previous studies with a similar hsv  capsid mutant localizing pul  to the cvsc density region that is distal to the penton however comparison of the cvsc density in a   resolution prv c capsid map with the available crystal structure of hsv  pul  failed to find a satisfactory fit suggesting either a different fold for prv pul  or a capsid bound conformation for pul  that does not match the x ray model determined from protein crystallized in solution the prv capsid imaged within virions closely resembles c capsids with the addition of weak but significant density shrouding the pentons that we attribute to tegument proteins our results demonstrate significant structure conservation between the prv and hsv capsids
