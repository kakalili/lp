electron microscopic observation and single stranded dna binding activity of the mcm   complex  edited by dr m yanagida
mcm   proteins that play an essential role in eukaryotic dna replication contain dna dependent atpase motifs in a central domain that from yeast to mammals is highly conserved our group has reported that a dna helicase activity is associated with a   kda human mcm   and  complex the structure of the mcm   complex was visualized by electron microscopy after negative staining with uranyl acetate the complex contained toroidal forms with a central channel and also contained structures with a slit gel shift analysis indicated that the level of affinity of the mcm   complex for single stranded dna was comparable to that of sv  t antigen although the mcm   complex required longer single stranded dna for the binding than did sv  t antigen the nucleoprotein complexes of mcm   and single stranded dna were visualized as beads in a queue or beads on string like structures the formation of these nucleoprotein complexes was erased by mcm that is a potential inhibitor of the mcm   helicase we also found that the dna helicase activity of mcm   complex was inhibited by the binding of mcm  complex these results support the notion that the mcm   complex functions as a dna helicase and the formation of   kda complex is essential for the activity
