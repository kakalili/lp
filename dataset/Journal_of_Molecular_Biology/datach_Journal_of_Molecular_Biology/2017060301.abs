proteasome structure and assembly
the eukaryotic  s proteasome is a large multisubunit complex that degrades the majority of proteins in the cell under normal conditions the  s proteasome can be divided into two subcomplexes the  s regulatory particle and the  s core particle most substrates are first covalently modified by ubiquitin which then directs them to the proteasome the function of the regulatory particle is to recognize unfold deubiquitylate and translocate substrates into the core particle which contains the proteolytic sites of the proteasome given the abundance and subunit complexity of the proteasome the assembly of this   mda complex must be carefully orchestrated to ensure its correct formation in recent years significant progress has been made in the understanding of proteasome assembly structure and function technical advances in cryo electron microscopy have resulted in a series of atomic cryo electron microscopy structures of both human and yeast  s proteasomes these structures have illuminated new intricacies and dynamics of the proteasome in this review we focus on the mechanisms of proteasome assembly particularly in light of recent structural information
