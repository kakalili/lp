disulfide reduced als variants of cu zn superoxide dismutase exhibit increased populations of unfolded species
cu zn superoxide dismutase sod  is a dimeric metal binding enzyme responsible for the dismutation of toxic superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen in cells mutations at dozens of sites in sod induce amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als  a fatal gain of function neurodegenerative disease whose molecular basis is unknown to obtain insights into effects of the mutations on the folded and unfolded populations of immature monomeric forms whose aggregation or self association may be responsible for als the thermodynamic and kinetic folding properties of a set of disulfide reduced and disulfide oxidized zn free and zn bound stable monomeric sod variants were compared to properties of the wild type wt protein the most striking effect of the mutations on the monomer stability was observed for the disulfide reduced metal free variants whereas the wt and s  n monomers are gt   folded at neutral ph and    c a v l v g a and l  v ranged from   to    unfolded the reduction of the disulfide bond was also found to reduce the apparent zn affinity of the wt monomer by   fold into the nanomolar range where it may be unable to compete for free zn in the cell with the exception of the s  n metal binding variant the zn affinity of disulfide oxidized sod monomers showed little sensitivity to amino acid replacements these results suggest a model for sod aggregation where the constant synthesis of als variants of sod on ribosomes provides a pool of species in which the increased population of the unfolded state may favor aggregation over productive folding to the native dimeric state
