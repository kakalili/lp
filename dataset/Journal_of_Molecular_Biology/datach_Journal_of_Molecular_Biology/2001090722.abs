visualization of the stop of microtubule depolymerization that occurs at the high density region of microtubule associated protein  map  edited by j karn
individual microtubules mts repeat alternating phases of polymerization and depolymerization a process known as dynamic instability microtubule associated proteins maps regulate the dynamic instability by increasing the rescue frequency to explore the influence of map on in vitro mt dynamics we correlated the distribution of map on individual mts with the dynamic phase changes of the same mts map was modified selectively on its projection region by x rhodamine iodoacetamide without altering the mt binding activity when the labeled map was added to mts the fluorescence was distributed along almost the entire length of individual mts however the inhomogeneity of the distribution gradually became obvious due to the fluorescence bleaching and the mts appeared to consist of rapidly bleached portions rbps and slowly bleached portions sbps  which were distributed randomly along the mt by measuring the duration of fluorescence bleaching the density of map in sbp was estimated to be approximately   times higher than the rbp the average tubulin map ratio in sbp was calculated to be   when the mt dynamics were observed by dark field microscopy after determining the map distribution rescues were always found to occur only at the sbps mts also displayed intermittent shortening by repeated depolymerization phases separated by pause phases in these cases depolymerization phases stopped only at the sbps not every sbp stopped depolymerization but depolymerization always stopped at an sbp taken together we suggest that there is a minimum density of map that is necessary to stop depolymerization
