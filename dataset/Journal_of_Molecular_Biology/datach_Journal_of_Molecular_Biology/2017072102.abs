a residue specific insight into the arkadia e ubiquitin ligase activity and conformational plasticity
arkadia rnf   is an e ubiquitin ligase that plays a central role in the amplification of transforming growth factor beta tgf   signaling responses by targeting for degradation the negative regulators of the pathway smad and smad  and the nuclear co repressors ski and skil snon  arkadia s function in vivo depends on the really interesting new gene ring  h interaction with the e enzyme ubch b in order to ligate ubiquitin chains on its substrates a conserved tryptophan w   in the c terminal  helix is widely accepted as essential for e recruitment and interaction and thus also for e enzymatic activity the present nmr driven study provides an atomic level investigation of the structural and dynamical properties of two w  arkadia ring mutants attempting to illuminate for the first time the differences between a functional and a nonfunctional mutant w  a and w  r respectively a tgf  responsive promoter driving luciferase was used to assay for arkadia function in vivo these experiments showed that the arkadia w  a mutant has the same activity as wild type wt arkadia in enhancing tgf  signaling responses while w  r does not only minor structural differences exist between the w  a ring domain and wt ring in contrast the w  r mutant hardly interacts with e  the loss of function correlates with structural changes in the c terminal  helix and an increase in the distance between the zn ii ions our data show that the position occupied by w  within wt arkadia is critical for the function of ring and that it depends on the nature of the residue at this position
