nucleocapsid protein annealing of a primer  template enhances   strand dna synthesis and fidelity by hiv  reverse transcriptase
human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  requires reverse transcriptase rt and hiv  nucleocapsid protein ncp  for proper viral replication hiv  ncp has been shown to enhance various steps in reverse transcription including trna initiation and strand transfer which may be mediated through interactions with rt as well as rna and dna oligonucleotides with the use of dna oligonucleotides we have examined the interaction of ncp with rt and the kinetics of reverse transcription during   strand synthesis with an ncp facilitated annealed primer  template through the use of a pre steady state kinetics approach the ncp annealed primer  template has a substantial increase   to  fold in the rate of incorporation kpol by rt as compared to heat annealed primer  template with single nucleotide incorporation there was also a  fold increase in the binding affinity constant kd of the nucleotide these differences in kpol and kd were not through direct interactions between hiv  rt and ncp  when extension by rt was examined the data suggest that the ncp annealed primer  template facilitates the formation of a longer product more quickly compared to the heat annealed primer  template this enhancement in rate is mediated through interactions with ncp s zinc fingers and n terminal domain and nucleic acids the ncp annealed primer  template also enhances the fidelity of rt  fold by slowing the rate of incorporation of an incorrect nucleotide taken together this study elucidates a new role of ncp by facilitating dna directed dna synthesis during reverse transcription by hiv  rt that may translate into enhanced viral fitness and offers an avenue to exploit for targeted therapeutic intervention against hiv
