crystal structure of pseudomonas aeruginosa tsi reveals a stably folded superhelical antitoxin
in the competition for niches in natural resources pseudomonas aeruginosa utilizes the type vi secretion system to inject the toxic protein effector tse into bacteria on cell  cell contact the cytoplasm toxin immunity protein tsi can neutralize tse by physical interaction with the toxin providing essential protection from toxin activity except for orthologues in p aeruginosa tsi antitoxin does not share detectable sequence homology with known proteins in public databases the mechanism underlying toxin neutralization by tsi remains unknown we report here the crystal structure of tsi at     resolution our structural and biophysical analyses demonstrate that the antitoxin adopts a previously unobserved superhelical conformation tsi is highly thermostable in the absence of the toxin in solution tsi assembles a dimer with  fold rotational symmetry similar to that observed in other toxin  antitoxin systems dimerization is essential for the stable folding of tsi
