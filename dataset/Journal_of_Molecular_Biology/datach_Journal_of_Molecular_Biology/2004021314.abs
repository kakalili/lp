crystal structure of a  butyrolactone autoregulator receptor protein in streptomyces coelicolor a
the  butyrolactone type autoregulator receptor systems in the gram positive bacterial genus streptomyces regulate morphological differentiation or antibiotic production or both the autoregulator receptors act as dna binding proteins and on binding their cognate ligands   butyrolactones they are released from the dna thus serving as repressors the crystal structure of cprb in streptomyces coelicolor a   a homologue of the a factor receptor protein arpa in streptomyces griseus was determined the overall structure of cprb shows that the  butyrolactone receptors belong to the tetr family cprb is composed of two domains a dna binding domain and a regulatory domain the regulatory domain contains a hydrophobic cavity which probably serves as a ligand binding pocket on the basis of the crystal structure of cprb and on the analogy of the characteristics of ligand tetr binding the binding of  butyrolactones to the regulatory domain of the receptors is supposed to induce the relocation of the dna binding domain through conformational changes of residues located between the ligand binding site and the dna binding domain which would result in the dissociation of the receptors from their target dna
