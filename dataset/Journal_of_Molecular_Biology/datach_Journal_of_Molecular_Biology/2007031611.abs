herpes simplex virus  up regulates il  gene expression in monocytic cells through the activation of protein tyrosine kinase and pkc zeta lambda signaling pathways
il  plays a seminal role in innate immunity through enhancing the cytotoxic function as well as cytokine production by nk and t cells we have previously shown that exposure of pbmc as well as monocytic cells to different viruses results in immediate up regulation of il  gene expression and subsequent nk cell activation as an innate immune response of those cells to these viruses however no signaling pathway involved in this up regulation has been identified here we show for the first time that hsv  induced up regulation of il  gene expression is independent of viral infectivity replication il  gene is up regulated by hsv  in human monocytes but not in cd  t cells hsv  induces the phosphorylation of protein tyrosine kinases ptks and protein kinase c pkc for inducing il  expression in monocytic cells inhibitors for ptks reduced hsv  induced ptk activity dna binding activity of nf kb as well as il  gene expression in contrast an inhibitor for membrane bound tyrosine kinases had no effect on these events experiments using pkc inhibitors revealed that phosphorylation of pkc zeta lambda pkc     dna binding activity of nf kb and hsv  induced up regulation of il  were all decreased furthermore we found that hsv  induced il  up regulation was also dependent on ptks regulation of pkc phosphorylation thus we conclude that il  up regulation in hsv  treated monocytic cells is dependent on the activity of both ptks and pkc
