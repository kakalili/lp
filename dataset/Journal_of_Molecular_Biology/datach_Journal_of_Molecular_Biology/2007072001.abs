active site properties of the oxidized and reduced c terminal domain of dsbd obtained by nmr spectroscopy
the periplasmic c terminal domain of the escherichia coli dsbd protein cdsbd has a thioredoxin fold the two cysteine residues in the cxxc motif serve as the reductant for the disulfide bond of the n terminal domain which can in turn act as a reductant for various periplasmic partners the resulting disulfide bond in cdsbd is reduced via an unknown mechanism by the transmembrane helical domain of the protein we show by nmr analysis of  c  n labelled cdsbd that the protein is rigid is stable to extremes of ph and undergoes only localized conformational changes in the vicinity of the cxxc motif and in adjacent regions of secondary structure upon undergoing the reduced oxidized transition pka values have been determined using d nmr for the n terminal cysteine of the cxxc motif cys   as well as for other active site residues it is demonstrated using site directed mutagenesis that the negative charges of the side chains of asp  and glu  in the active site contribute to the unusually high pka value    of cys   this value is higher than expected from knowledge of the reduction potential of cdsbd in a double mutant of cdsbd d  n e  q the pka value of cys  is lowered to   a value close to that expected for an unperturbed cysteine residue the pka value of the second cysteine in wild type cdsbd cys   is significantly higher than the maximum ph value that was studied ph
