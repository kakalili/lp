structural basis of recognition of monopartite and bipartite nuclear localization sequences by mammalian importin   edited by k nagai
importin  is the nuclear import receptor that recognizes cargo proteins which contain classical monopartite and bipartite nuclear localization sequences nlss  and facilitates their transport into the nucleus to determine the structural basis of the recognition of the two classes of nlss by mammalian importin   we co crystallized an n terminally truncated mouse receptor protein with peptides corresponding to the monopartite nls from the simian virus   sv  large t antigen and the bipartite nls from nucleoplasmin we show that the monopartite sv  large t antigen nls binds to two binding sites on the receptor similar to what was observed in yeast importin   the nucleoplasmin nls importin  complex shows for the first time the mode of binding of bipartite nlss to the receptor the two basic clusters in the nls occupy the two binding sites used by the monopartite nls while the sequence linking the two basic clusters is poorly ordered consistent with its tolerance to mutations the structures explain the structural basis for binding of diverse nlss to the sole receptor protein
