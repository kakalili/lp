impact of ligand and protein desolvation on ligand binding to the s pocket of thrombin
in the present study we investigate the impact of a tightly bound water molecule on ligand binding in the s pocket of thrombin the s pocket contains a deeply buried deprotonated aspartate residue asp   that is due to its charged state well hydrated in the uncomplexed state we systematically studied the importance of this water molecule by evaluating a series of ligands that contains pyridine type p side chains that could potentially alter the binding properties of this water molecule all of the pyridine derivatives retain the original hydration state albeit sometimes with a slight perturbance in order to prevent a direct h bond formation with asp   and to create a permanent positive charge on the p side chain that is positioned adjacent to the asp  carboxylate anion we methylated the pyridine nitrogen this methylation resulted in displacement of water but was accompanied by a loss in binding affinity quantum chemical calculations of the ligand solvation free energy showed that the positively charged methylpyridinium derivatives suffer a large penalty of desolvation upon binding consequently they have a substantially less favorable enthalpy of binding in addition to the ligand desolvation penalty the hydration shell around asp  has to be overcome which is achieved in nearly all pyridinium derivatives only for the ortho derivative is a partial population of a water next to asp  found possibly the gain of electrostatic interactions between the charged p side chain and asp  helps to compensate for the desolvation penalty in all uncharged pyridine derivatives the solvation shell remains next to asp   partly mediating interactions between ligand and protein in the case of the para pyridine derivative a strongly disordered cluster of water sites is observed between ligand and asp
