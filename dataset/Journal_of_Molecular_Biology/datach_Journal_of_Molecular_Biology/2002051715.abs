crystal structure of a non canonical low affinity peptide complexed with mhc class i a new approach for vaccine design
peptides bind with high affinity to mhc class i molecules by anchoring certain side chains anchors into specificity pockets in the mhc peptide binding groove peptides that do not contain these canonical anchor residues normally have low affinity resulting in impaired pmhc stability and loss of immunogenicity here we report the crystal structure at    resolution of an immunogenic low affinity peptide from the tumor associated antigen muc  bound to h kb stable binding is still achieved despite small non canonical residues in the c and f anchor pockets this muc kb structure reveals how low affinity peptides can be utilized in the design of novel peptide based tumor vaccines the molecular interactions elucidated in this non canonical low affinity peptide mhc complex should help uncover additional immunogenic peptides from primary protein sequences and aid in the design of alternative approaches for t cell vaccines
