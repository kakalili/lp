aggregation prone motifs in human immunoglobulin g
therapeutic antibodies of many different igg subclasses igg  igg and igg  are used in the treatment of various cancers rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory and infectious diseases these antibodies are stored for long durations under high concentrations as required in the disease treatment unfortunately these antibodies aggregate under these storage conditions leading to a decrease in antibody activity and raising concerns about causing an immunological response thus there is a tremendous need to identify the aggregation prone regions in different classes of antibodies we use the sap spatial aggregation propensity technology based on molecular simulations to determine the aggregation prone motifs in the constant regions of igg classes of antibodies mutations engineered on these aggregation prone motif regions led to antibodies of enhanced stability fourteen aggregation prone motifs are identified with each motif containing one to seven residues while some of these motifs contain residues that are neighbors in primary sequence others contain residues that are far apart in primary sequence but are close together in the tertiary structure comparison of the igg sequence with those of other subclasses igg  igg and igg  showed that these aggregation prone motifs are largely preserved among all igg subclasses other broader classes of antibodies iga  igd ige and igm  however differed in these motif regions the aggregation prone motifs identified were therefore common to all igg subclasses but differ from those of non igg classes moreover since the motifs identified are in the constant regions they are applicable for all antibodies within the igg class irrespective of the variable region thus the motif regions identified could be modified on all iggs to yield antibodies of enhanced stability
