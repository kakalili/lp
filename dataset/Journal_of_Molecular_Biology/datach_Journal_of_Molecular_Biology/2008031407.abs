structure of the minor pseudopilin epsh from the type  secretion system of vibrio cholerae
many gram negative bacteria use the multi protein type ii secretion system t ss to selectively translocate virulence factors from the periplasmic space into the extracellular environment in vibrio cholerae the t ss is called the extracellular protein secretion eps system which translocates cholera toxin and several enzymes in their folded state across the outer membrane five proteins of the t ss the pseudopilins are thought to assemble into a pseudopilus which may control the outer membrane pore epsd and participate in the active export of proteins in a  piston like  manner we report here the     resolution crystal structure of an n terminally truncated variant of epsh a minor pseudopilin from vibrio cholerae while epsh maintains an n terminal  helix and c terminal  sheet consistent with the type a pilin fold structural comparisons reveal major differences between the minor pseudopilin epsh and the major pseudopilin gspg from klebsiella oxytoca epsh contains a large  sheet in the variable domain where gspg contains an  helix most importantly epsh contains at its surface a hydrophobic crevice between its variable and conserved  sheets wherein a majority of the conserved residues within the epsh family are clustered in a tentative model of a t ss pseudopilus with epsh at its tip the conserved crevice faces away from the helix axis this conserved surface region may be critical for interacting with other proteins from the t ss machinery
