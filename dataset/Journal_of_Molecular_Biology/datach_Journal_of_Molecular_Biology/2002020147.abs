sugar specificity of bacterial cmp kinases as revealed by crystal structures and mutagenesis of escherichia coli enzyme edited by k morikawa
bacterial cytidine monophosphate cmp kinases are characterised by an insert enlarging their cmp binding domain and by their particular substrate specificity thus both cmp and   deoxy cmp dcmp are good phosphate acceptors for the cmp kinase from escherichia coli e coli cmpk  whereas eukaryotic ump cmp kinases phosphorylate the deoxynucleotides with very low efficiency four crystal structures of e coli cmpk complexed with nucleoside monophosphates differing in their sugar moiety were solved both structures with cmp or dcmp show interactions with the pentose that were not described so far these interactions are lost with the poorer substrates aracmp and      dideoxy cmp comparison of all four structures shows that the pentose hydroxyls are involved in ligand induced movements of enzyme domains it also gives a structural basis of the mechanism by which either ribose or deoxyribose can be accommodated in parallel for the four nucleotides the kinetic results of the wild type enzyme and of three structure based variants are presented the phosphorylation rate is significantly decreased when either of the two pentose interacting residues is mutated one of these is an arginine that is highly conserved in all known nucleoside monophosphate kinases in contrast the other residue asp   is typical of bacterial cmp kinases it interacts with ser   the only residue conserved in all cmp binding domain inserts mutating ser  reduces cmp phosphorylation only moderately but dramatically reduces dcmp phosphorylation this is the first experimental evidence of a catalytic role involving the characteristic insert of bacterial cmp kinases furthermore this role concerns only dcmp phosphorylation a feature of this family of enzymes
