molecular architecture of cag repeats in human disease related transcripts
cag repeats are present in numerous human transcripts but neither their structures nor physiological functions have been satisfactorily recognized the expanded cag repeats are present in transcripts from several mutant genes associated with hereditary neurodegenerative diseases but their contribution to pathogenesis has not been documented convincingly here we show that the structures formed by the repeats and their natural flanking sequences in the spinocerebellar ataxia sca type  and type  and dentatorubral palidoluysian atrophy drpla transcripts have different molecular architectures which may have functional meaning we provide evidence that the hairpin structure formed by cag repeats in mrna fragments is preserved in full length mrna we also demonstrate that the single nucleotide polymorphism snp that is located immediately adjacent    to the repeats of the sca transcript modulates the structures formed by these sequences and may have functional significance as only one of its variants is selected in human evolution
