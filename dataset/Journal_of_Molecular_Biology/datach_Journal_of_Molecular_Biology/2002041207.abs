stiffness of the distal loop restricts the structural heterogeneity of the transition state ensemble in sh domains edited by a r fersht
protein engineering experiments and  f value analysis of sh domains reveal that their transition state ensemble tse is conformationally restricted i e the fluctuations in the transition state ts structures are small in the ts of src sh and  spectrin sh the distal loop and the associated hairpin are fully structured while the rest of the protein is relatively disordered if native structure predominantly determines the folding mechanism the findings for sh folds raise the question what are the features of the native topology that determine the nature of the tse we propose that the presence of stiff loops in the native state that connect local structural elements such as the distal hairpin in sh domains conformationally restricts tse we validate this hypothesis using the simulations of a  control  system   residue  hairpin forming c terminal fragment of the gbl protein and its variants in these fragments the role of bending rigidity in determining the nature of the tse can be directly examined without complications arising from interactions with the rest of the protein the tse structures in the  hairpins are determined computationally using cluster analysis and limited  f value analysis both techniques prove that the conformational heterogeneity decreases as the bending rigidity of the loop increases to extend this finding to sh domains a measure of bending rigidity based on loop curvature which utilizes native structures in the protein data bank pdb  is introduced using this measure we show that with few exceptions the ordering of stiffness of the distal n src and rt loops in the  pdb structures of sh domains is conserved combining the simulation results for  hairpins and the analysis of pdb structures for sh domains we propose that the stiff distal loop restricts the conformational fluctuations in the tse we also predict that constraining the distal loop to be preformed in the denatured ensemble should not alter the nature of tse on the other hand if the amino and carboxy terminals are cross linked to form a circular polypeptide chain the pathways and tss are altered these contrasting scenarios are illustrated using simulations of cross linked wt  hairpin fragments computations of bending rigidities for immunoglobulin like domain proteins reveal no clear separation in the stiffness of their loops in the  sandwich proteins which have large fractions of non local native contacts the nature of the tse cannot be apparently determined using purely local structural characteristics nevertheless the measure of loop stiffness still provides qualitative predictions of the ordered regions in the tse of ig  and tenfn
