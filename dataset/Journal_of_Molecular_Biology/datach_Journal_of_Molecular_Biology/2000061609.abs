estimating the number of protein folds and families from complete genome data edited by j thornton
using the data on proteins encoded in complete genomes combined with a rigorous theory of the sampling process we estimate the total number of protein folds and families as well as the number of folds and families in each genome the total number of folds in globular water soluble proteins is estimated at about    with structural information currently available for about one third of that number the sequenced genomes of unicellular organisms encode from approximately    for the minimal genomes of the mycoplasmas to      for larger genomes such as escherichia coli and yeast of the total number of folds the number of protein families with significant sequence conservation was estimated to be between   and    with structures available for about   of these
