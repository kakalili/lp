prmt interacts with ass and citrullinemia mutations disrupt the interaction
protein arginine methyltransferase  prmt  catalyzes the introduction of monomethylation marks at the arginine residues of substrate proteins prmt plays important roles in the regulation of gene expression splicing dna damage paternal imprinting cancer and metastasis however little is known about the interaction partners of prmt  to address this we performed yeast two hybrid screening of prmt and identified argininosuccinate synthetase ass  as a potential interaction partner of prmt  we confirmed that prmt directly interacts with ass using pull down studies ass catalyzes the rate limiting step of arginine synthesis in urea cycle and citrulline nitric oxide cycle we mapped the interface of prmt  ass complex through computational approaches and validated the predicted interface in vivo by site directed mutagenesis evolutionary analysis revealed that the ass residues important for prmt  ass interaction have co evolved with prmt  we showed that ass mutations linked to type i citrullinemia disrupt the ass  prmt interaction which might explain the molecular pathogenesis of the disease
