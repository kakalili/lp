assembly architecture and dna binding of the bacteriophage p  terminase small subunit
morphogenesis of bacteriophage p  involves the packaging of double stranded dna into a preassembled procapsid dna is translocated by a powerful virally encoded molecular motor called terminase which comprises large gp    residues and small gp    residues subunits while gp contains the phosphohydrolase and endonuclease activities of terminase the function of gp may be to regulate specific and nonspecific modes of dna recognition as well as the enzymatic activities of gp  electron microscopy shows that wild type gp self assembles into a stable and monodisperse nonameric ring a three dimensional reconstruction at    resolution provides the first glimpse of p  terminase architecture and implies two distinct modes of interaction with dna  involving a central channel of    diameter and radial spikes separated by     electromobility shift assays indicate that the gp ring binds double stranded dna nonspecifically in vitro via electrostatic interactions between the positively charged c terminus of gp  residues      and phosphates of the dna backbone raman spectra show that nonameric rings formed by subunits truncated at residue   retain the subunit fold despite the loss of dna binding activity difference density maps between gp rings containing full length and c terminally truncated subunits are consistent with localization of residues      along the central channel of the nonameric ring the results suggest a plausible molecular mechanism for gp function in dna recognition and translocation
