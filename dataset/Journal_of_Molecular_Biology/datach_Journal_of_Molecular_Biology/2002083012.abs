t dna helicase a molecular motor that processively and unidirectionally translocates along single stranded dna
dna helicases are molecular motors that use the energy from ntp hydrolysis to drive the process of duplex dna strand separation here we measure the translocation and energy coupling efficiency of a replicative dna helicase from bacteriophage t that is a member of a class of helicases that assembles into ring shaped hexamers presteady state kinetics of dna stimulated dttp hydrolysis activity of t helicase were measured using a real time assay as a function of ssdna length which provided evidence for unidirectional translocation of t helicase along ssdna global fitting of the kinetic data provided an average translocation rate of   bases per second per hexamer at   c while translocating along ssdna t helicase hydrolyzes dttp at a rate of  dttp per second per hexamer which indicates that the energy from hydrolysis of one dttp drives unidirectional movement of t helicase along two to three bases of ssdna one of the features that distinguishes this ring helicase is its processivity which was determined to be     which indicated that t helicase travels on an average about  kb of ssdna before dissociating we propose that the ability of t helicase to translocate unidirectionally along ssdna in an efficient manner plays a crucial role in dna unwinding
