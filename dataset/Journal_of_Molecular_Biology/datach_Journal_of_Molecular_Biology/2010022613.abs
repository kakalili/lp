crystal structure analysis of free and substrate bound  hydroxy l nicotine oxidase from arthrobacter nicotinovorans
the pathway for oxidative degradation of nicotine in arthrobacter nicotinovorans includes two genetically and structurally unrelated flavoenzymes  hydroxy l nicotine oxidase  hlno and  hydroxy d nicotine oxidase which act with absolute stereospecificity on the l and d forms respectively of  hydroxy nicotine we solved the crystal structure of hlno at     resolution by combined isomorphous multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing the overall structure of each subunit of the hlno homodimer and the folds of the individual domains are closely similar as in eukaryotic monoamine oxidases unexpectedly a diacylglycerophospholipid molecule was found to be non covalently bound to each protomer of hlno the fatty acid chains occupy hydrophobic channels that penetrate deep into the interior of the substrate binding domain of each subunit the solvent exposed glycerophosphate moiety is located at the subunit  subunit interface we further solved the crystal structure of a complex of dithionite reduced hlno with the natural substrate  hydroxy l nicotine at     resolution the location of the substrate in a tight cavity suggests that the binding geometry of this unproductive complex may be closely similar as under oxidizing conditions the observed orientation of the bound substrate relative to the isoalloxazine ring of the flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor is suitable for hydride transfer dehydrogenation at the carbon atom that forms the chiral center of the substrate molecule a comparison of the substrate binding modes of hlno and  hydroxy d nicotine oxidase based on models of complexes with the d substrate suggests an explanation for the stereospecificity of both enzymes the two enzymes are proposed to orient the enantiomeric substrates in mirror symmetry with respect to the plane of the flavin
