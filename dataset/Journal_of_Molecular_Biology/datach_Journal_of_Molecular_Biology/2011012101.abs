phosphorylation and mutation of phospholamban alter physical interactions with the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump
phospholamban physically interacts with the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump serca and regulates contractility of the heart in response to adrenergic stimuli we studied this interaction using electron microscopy of d crystals of serca in complex with phospholamban in earlier studies phospholamban oligomers were found interspersed between serca dimer ribbons and a d model was constructed to show interactions with serca in this study we examined the oligomeric state of phospholamban and the effects of phosphorylation and mutation of phospholamban on the interaction with serca in the d crystals on the basis of projection maps from negatively stained and frozen hydrated crystals phosphorylation of ser  selectively disordered the cytoplasmic domain of wild type phospholamban this was not the case for a pentameric gain of function mutant lys ala  which retained inhibitory activity and remained ordered in the phosphorylated state a partial loss of function mutation that altered the charge state of phospholamban arg ala retained an ordered state while a complete loss of function mutation asn ala was also disordered the functional state of phospholamban was correlated with an order to disorder transition of the phospholamban cytoplasmic domain in the d co crystals furthermore co crystals of the gain of function mutant lys ala facilitated data collection from frozen hydrated crystals an improved projection map was calculated to a resolution of    which supports the pentamer as the oligomeric state of phospholamban in the crystals the d co crystals with serca require a functional pentameric form of phospholamban which physically interacts with serca at an accessory site distinct from that used by the phospholamban monomer for the inhibitory association
