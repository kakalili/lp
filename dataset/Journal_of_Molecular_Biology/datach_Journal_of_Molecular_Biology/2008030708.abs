structure of the n terminal oligomerization domain of dnad reveals a unique tetramerization motif and provides insights into scaffold formation
dnad is a primosomal protein that remodels supercoiled plasmids it binds to supercoiled forms and converts them to open forms without nicking during this remodeling process all the writhe is converted to twist and the plasmids are held around the periphery of large scaffolds made up of dnad molecules this dna remodeling function is the sum of a scaffold forming activity on the n terminal domain and a dna dependent oligomerization activity on the c terminal domain we have determined the crystal structure of the scaffold forming n terminal domain which reveals a winged helix architecture with additional structural elements extending from both n and c termini four monomers form dimers that join into a tetramer the n terminal extension mediates dimerization and tetramerization with extensive interactions and distinct interfaces the wings and helices of the winged helix domains remain exposed on the surface of the tetramer structure guided mutagenesis and atomic force microscopy imaging indicate that these elements together with the c terminal extension are involved in scaffold formation based upon our data we propose a model for the dnad mediated scaffold formation
