We have probed the structure and dynamics of ribosomal RNA in the Escherichia coli ribosome using equilibrium and time-resolved hydroxyl radical (OH) RNA footprinting to explore changes in the solvent-accessible surface of the rRNA with single-nucleotide resolution. The goal of these studies is to better understand the structural transitions that accompany association of the 30 S and 50 S subunits and to build a foundation for the quantitative analysis of ribosome structural dynamics during translation. Clear portraits of the subunit interface surfaces for 16 S and 23 S rRNA were obtained by constructing difference maps between the OH protection maps of the free subunits and that of the associated ribosome. In addition to inter-subunit contacts consistent with the crystal structure, additional OH protections are evident in regions at or near the subunit interface that reflect association-induced conformational changes. Comparison of these data with the comparable difference maps of the solvent-accessible surface of the rRNA calculated for the Thermus thermophilus X-ray crystal structures shows extensive agreement but also distinct differences. As a prelude to time-resolved OH footprinting studies, the reactivity profiles obtained using Fe(II)EDTA and X-ray generated OH were comprehensively compared. The reactivity patterns are similar except for a small number of nucleotides that have decreased reactivity to OH generated from Fe(II)EDTA compared to X-rays. These nucleotides are generally close to ribosomal proteins, which can quench diffusing radicals by virtue of side-chain oxidation. Synchrotron X-ray OH footprinting was used to monitor the kinetics of association of the 30 S and 50 S subunits. The rates individually measured for the inter-subunit contacts are comparable within experimental error. The application of this approach to the study of ribosome dynamics during the translation cycle is discussed.
