direct transmembrane interaction between actin and the pore competent cholesterol dependent cytolysin pneumolysin
the eukaryotic actin cytoskeleton is an evolutionarily well established pathogen target as a large number of bacterial factors disturb its dynamics to alter the function of the host cells these pathogenic factors modulate or mimic actin effector proteins or they modify actin directly leading to an imbalance of the precisely regulated actin turnover here we show that the pore forming cholesterol dependent cytolysin pneumolysin ply  a major neurotoxin of streptococcus pneumoniae has the capacity to bind actin directly and to enhance actin polymerisation in vitro in cells the toxin co localised with f actin shortly after exposure and this direct interaction was verified by f rster resonance energy transfer ply was capable of exerting its effect on actin through the lipid bilayer of giant unilamellar vesicles but only when its pore competence was preserved the dissociation constant of g actin binding to ply in a biochemical environment was     nm which is indicative of a high affinity interaction comparable to the affinity of other intracellular actin binding factors our results demonstrate the first example of a direct interaction of a pore forming toxin with cytoskeletal components suggesting that the cross talk between pore forming cytolysins and cells is more complex than previously thought
