the structure of aquifex aeolicus ribosomal protein s reveals a unique subdomain that contributes to an extremely tight association with  s rrna
the assembly of ribonucleoprotein complexes occurs under a broad range of conditions but the principles that promote assembly and allow function at high temperature are poorly understood the ribosomal protein s from aquifex aeolicus as  is unique in that there is a  residue insertion in the consensus s sequence in addition as exhibits an unusually high affinity for the  s ribosomal rna characterized by a picomolar dissociation constant that is approximately    fold tighter than the equivalent interaction from escherichia coli deletion analysis demonstrated that binding to the minimal site on helix  occurred at the same nanomolar affinity found for other bacterial species the additional affinity required the presence of a three helix junction between helices     and   the crystal structure of as was solved revealing the helix  loop  helix geometry of the unique as insertion region while the core of the molecule is conserved with known s structures the as structure was modeled onto the structure of the  s ribosomal subunit from e coli suggesting the possibility that the unique subdomain provides additional backbone and side chain contacts between the protein and an unpaired base within the three way junction of helices     and   point mutations in the protein insertion subdomain resulted in a significantly reduced rna binding affinity with respect to wild type as  these results indicate that the as specific subdomain provides additional interactions with the three way junction that contribute to the extremely tight binding to ribosomal rna
