the linkage between magnesium binding and rna folding edited by b honig
understanding the linkage between mg  binding and rna folding requires a proper theoretical model describing the energetics of mg  binding to the folded and unfolded states of rna our current understanding of mg  binding to these different rna states derives from empirical thermodynamic models that depend on a number of unjustified assumptions we present a rigorous theoretical model describing the linkage between rna folding and magnesium ion binding in this model based on the non linear poisson boltzmann nlpb equation the stabilization of rna by mg  arises from two distinct binding modes diffuse binding and site binding diffusely bound mg  are described as an ensemble of hydrated ions that are attracted to the negative charge of the rna site bound mg  are partially desolvated ions that are attracted to electronegative pockets on the rna surface we explore two systems yeast trnaphe and a  nucleotide rrna fragment with different mg  binding properties the nlpb equation accurately describes both the stoichiometric and energetic linkage between mg  binding and rna folding for both of these systems without requiring any fitted parameters in the calculation moreover the nlpb model presents a well defined physical description of how mg  binding helps fold an rna for both of the molecules studied here the relevant unfolded state is a disordered intermediate state i that contains stable helical secondary structure without any tertiary contacts diffusely bound mg  interact with these secondary structure elements to stabilize the i state the secondary structural elements of the i state fold into a compact native tertiary structure the n state  diffuse binding plays a dominant role in stabilizing the n state for both rnas studied however for the rrna fragment site binding to a location with extraordinarily high electrostatic potential is also coupled to folding our results suggest that much experimental data measuring the linkage between mg  binding and rna folding must be reinterpreted
