Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channels are expressed strongly in glial cells, where they play a role in brain water balance, neuroexcitation, and glial cell migration. Here, we investigated a proposed new role of AQP4 in facilitating cell–cell adhesion. Measurements were made in differentiated primary glial cell cultures from wild-type versus AQP4 knockout mice as well as in null versus AQP4-transfected L-cells, a cell type lacking endogenous adhesion molecules, and in null versus AQP4-transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells and Fisher rat thyroid cells. Using established assays of cell–cell adhesion, we found no significant effect of AQP4 expression on adhesion in each of the cell types. As a positive control, transfection with E-cadherin greatly increased cell–cell adhesion. High-level AQP4 expression also did not affect aggregation of plasma membrane vesicles in a sensitive quasi-elastic light-scattering assay. Further, we found no specific AQP4 binding of a fluorescently labeled oligopeptide containing the putative adhesion sequence in the second extracellular loop of AQP4. These data provide evidence against involvement of AQP4 in cell–cell adhesion.
