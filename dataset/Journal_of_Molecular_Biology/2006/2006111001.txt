Recent 15N and 13C spin-relaxation dispersion studies of fast-folding mutants of the Fyn SH3 domain have established that folding proceeds through a low-populated on-pathway intermediate (I) where the central β-sheet is at least partially formed, but without interactions between the NH2- and COOH-terminal β-strands that exist in the folded state (F). Initial studies focused on mutants where Gly48 is replaced; in an effort to establish whether this intermediate is a general feature of Fyn SH3 folding a series of 15N relaxation experiments monitoring the folding of Fyn SH3 mutants N53P/V55L and A39V/N53P/V55L are reported here. For these mutants as well, folding proceeds through an on-pathway intermediate with similar features to those observed for G48M and G48V Fyn SH3 domains. However, the 15N chemical shifts extracted for the intermediate indicate pronounced non-native contacts between the NH2 and COOH-terminal regions not observed previously. The kinetic parameters extracted for the folding of A39V/N53P/V55L Fyn SH3 from the three-state folding model F↔I↔U are in good agreement with folding and unfolding rates extrapolated to zero denaturant obtained from stopped-flow experiments analyzed in terms of a simplified two-state folding reaction. The folding of the triple mutant was studied over a wide range of temperatures, establishing that there is no difference in heat capacities between F and I states. This confirms a compact folding intermediate structure, which is supported by the 15N chemical shifts of the I state extracted from the dispersion data. The temperature-dependent relaxation data simplifies data analysis because at low temperatures (&lt;25 °C) the unfolded state (U) is negligibly populated relative to I and F. A comparison between parameters extracted at low temperatures where the F↔I exchange model is appropriate with those from the more complex, three-state model at higher temperatures has been used to validate the protocol for analysis of three-site exchange relaxation data.
