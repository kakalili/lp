roles of the ccoghis gene products in the biogenesis of the cbb type cytochrome c oxidase edited by m gottesman
in many bacteria the ccoghis cluster located immediately downstream of the structural genes cconoqp of cytochrome cbb oxidase is required for the biogenesis of this enzyme genetic analysis of ccoghis in rhodobacter capsulatus demonstrated that ccog ccoh ccoi and ccos are expressed independently of each other and do not form a simple operon absence of ccog which has putative  fe s cluster binding motifs does not significantly affect cytochrome cbb oxidase activity however ccoh and ccoi are required for normal steady state amounts of the enzyme ccoi is highly homologous to atp dependent metal ion transporters and appears to be involved in the acquisition of copper for cytochrome cbb oxidase since a ccoi minus phenotype could be mimicked by copper ion starvation of a wild type strain remarkably the small protein ccos with a putative single transmembrane span is essential for the incorporation of the redox active prosthetic groups heme b heme b and cu into the cytochrome cbb oxidase thus the ccoghis products are involved in several steps during the maturation of the cytochrome cbb oxidase
