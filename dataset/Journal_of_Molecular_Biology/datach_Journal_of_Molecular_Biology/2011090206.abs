the structure of brms nuclear export signal and snx interacting region reveals a hexamer formed by antiparallel coiled coils
we present here the first structural report derived from breast cancer metastasis suppressor  brms  a member of the metastasis suppressor protein group which during recent years have drawn much attention since they suppress metastasis without affecting the growth of the primary tumor the relevance of the predicted n terminal coiled coil on the molecular recognition of some of the brms partners on its cellular localization and on the role of brms biological functions such as transcriptional repression prompted us to characterize its three dimensional structure by x ray crystallography the structure of brms n terminal region reveals that residues     form an antiparallel coiled coil motif and also that it has the capability of homo oligomerizing in a hexameric conformation by forming a trimer of coiled coil dimers we have also performed hydrodynamic experiments that strongly supported the prevalence in solution of this quaternary structure for brms     this work explores the structural features of brms n terminal region to help clarify the role of this area in the context of the full length protein our crystallographic and biophysical results suggest that the biological function of brms may be affected by its ability to promote molecular clustering through its n terminal coiled coil region
