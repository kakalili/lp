an insight into the pathway of the amyloid fibril formation of hen egg white lysozyme obtained from a small angle x ray and neutron scattering study
it is known that hen egg white lysozyme hewl forms amyloid fibrils since hewl is one of the proteins that have been studied most extensively and is closely related to human lysozyme the variants of which form the amyloid fibrils that are related to hereditary systemic amyloidosis this protein is an ideal model to study the mechanism of amyloid fibril formation in order to gain an insight into the mechanism of amyloid fibril formation systematic and detailed studies to detect and characterize various structural states of hewl were conducted since hewl forms amyloid fibrils in highly concentrated ethanol solutions solutions of various concentrations of hewl in various concentrations of ethanol were prepared and the structures of hewl in these solutions were investigated by small angle x ray and neutron scattering it was shown that the structural states of hewl were distinguished as the monomer state the state of the dimer formation the state of the protofilament formation the protofilament state and the state towards the formation of amyloid fibrils a phase diagram of these structural states was obtained as a function of protein water and ethanol concentrations it was found that under the monomer state the structural changes of hewl were not gross changes in shape but local conformational changes and the dimers formed by the association at the end of the long axis of hewl had an elongated shape circular dichroism measurements showed that the large changes in the secondary structures of hewl occurred during dimer formation the protofilaments were formed by stacking of the dimers with their long axis nearly perpendicular to and rotated around the protofilament axis to form a helical structure these protofilaments were characterized by their radius of gyration of the cross section of  nm and the mass per unit length of        da nm it was shown that the changes of the structural states towards the amyloid fibril formation occurred via lateral association of the protofilaments a pathway of the amyloid fibril formation of hewl was proposed from these results
