a bacterial transcription terminator with inefficient molecular motor action but with a robust transcription termination function
molecular motors such as helicases translocases are capable of translocating along the single stranded nucleic acids and unwinding dna or rna duplex substrates using the energy derived from their atpase activity the bacterial transcription terminator rho is a hexameric helicase and releases rna from the transcription elongation complexes by an unknown mechanism it has been proposed but not directly demonstrated that kinetic energy obtained from its molecular motor action helicase translocase activities is instrumental in dissociating the transcription elongation complex here we report a hexameric rho analogue rv   m tb rho from mycobacterium tuberculosis having poor rna dependent atp hydrolysis and inefficient dna  rna unwinding activities however compared to escherichia coli rho it exhibited very robust and earlier transcription termination from the elongation complexes of e coli rna polymerase bicyclomycin an inhibitor of atpase as well as rna release activities of e coli rho inhibited the atpase activity of m tb rho with comparable efficiency but was not efficient in inhibiting its transcription termination function unlike e coli rho m tb rho was capable of releasing rna in the presence of nonhydrolyzable analogues of atp quite efficiently also this termination function most likely does not require nusg an rna release facilitator as this rho was incapable of binding to nusg either of m tb  rv   or e coli these results strongly suggest that the atpase activity of m tb rho is uncoupled from its transcription termination function and this function may not be dependent on its helicase translocase activity
