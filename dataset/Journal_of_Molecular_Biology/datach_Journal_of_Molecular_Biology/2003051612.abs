folding of a  sheet protein monitored by real time nmr spectroscopy
at low ionic strength apoplastocyanin forms an unfolded state under non denaturing conditions the refolding of this state is sufficiently slow to allow real time nmr experiments to be performed folding of apoplastocyanin initiated by the addition of salt and followed by real time d h   n heteronuclear single quantum coherence hsqc spectroscopy is highly cooperative a concomitant increase in the intensity of both sequential and long range nuclear overhauser effects noes between backbone amide protons in successive acquisitions of h   n hsqc noesy hsqc spectra provides the first direct observation of the development of structure specific noes as a protein folds our results show that the local and long range interactions in the native apoplastocyanin are formed simultaneously consistent with highly cooperative formation of the native structure
