evidence for a novel binding site conformer of aldose reductase in ligand bound state
human aldose reductase alr  has evolved as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetic long term complications the binding site of this enzyme possesses two main subpockets the catalytic anion binding site and the hydrophobic specificity pocket the latter can be observed in the open or closed state depending on the bound ligand thus it exhibits a pronounced capability for induced fit adaptations whereas the catalytic pocket exhibits rigid properties throughout all known crystal structures here we determined two alr crystal structures at   and     resolution each complexed with an inhibitor of the recently described naphtho   d isothiazole acetic acid series in contrast to the original design hypothesis based on the binding mode of tolrestat   both inhibitors leave the specificity pocket in the closed state unexpectedly the more potent ligand   extends the catalytic pocket by opening a novel subpocket access to this novel subpocket is mainly attributed to the rotation of an indole moiety of trp  by about    the newly formed subpocket provides accommodation of the naphthyl portion of the ligand the second inhibitor   differs from  only by an extended glycolic ester functionality added to one of its carboxylic groups however despite this slight structural modification the binding mode of  differs dramatically from that of the first inhibitor but provokes less pronounced induced fit adaptations of the binding cavity thus a novel binding site conformation has been identified in a region where previous complex structures suggested only low adaptability of the binding pocket furthermore the two ligand complexes represent an impressive example of how the slight change of a chemically extended side chain at a given ligand scaffold can result in a dramatically altered binding mode in addition our study emphasizes the importance of crystal structure analysis for the translation of affinity data into structure  activity relationships
