ultrastructural analysis of ipad at the tip of the nascent mxih type iii secretion apparatus of shigella flexneri
shigella flexneri is a gram negative enteric pathogen that is the predominant cause of bacillary dysentery shigella uses a type iii secretion system to deliver effector proteins that alter normal target cell functions to promote pathogen invasion the type iii secretion apparatus t sa consists of a basal body an extracellular needle and a tip complex that is responsible for delivering effectors into the host cell cytoplasm ipad ipa invasion plasmid antigen  is the first protein to localize to the t sa needle tip where it prevents premature effector secretion and serves as an environmental sensor for triggering recruitment of the translocator protein ipab to the needle tip thus ipad would be expected to form a stable structure whose overall architecture supports its functions it is not immediately obvious from the published ipad crystal structure protein data bank id j o how a multimer of ipad would be incorporated at the tip of the first static t sa intermediate nor what its functional role would be in building a mature t sa here we produce three dimensional reconstructions from transmission electron microscopy images of ipad localized at the shigella t sa needle tip for comparison to needle tips from a shigella ipad null mutant the results demonstrate that ipad resides as a homopentamer at the needle tip of the t sa furthermore comparison to tips assembled from the distal domain ipad     mutation shows that ipad adopts an elongated conformation that facilitates its ability to control type iii secretion and stepwise assembly of the t sa needle tip complex
