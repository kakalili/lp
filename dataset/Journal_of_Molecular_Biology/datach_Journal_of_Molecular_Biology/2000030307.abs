molecular dynamics simulations of a  hairpin fragment of protein g balance between side chain and backbone forces edited by f e cohen
how is the native structure encoded in the amino acid sequence for the traditional backbone centric view the dominant forces are hydrogen bonds backbone and    propensity the role of hydrophobicity is non specific for the side chain centric view the dominant force of protein folding is hydrophobicity in order to understand the balance between backbone and side chain forces we have studied the contributions of three components of a  hairpin peptide turn backbone hydrogen bonding and side chain interactions of a  residue fragment of protein g the peptide folds rapidly and cooperatively to a conformation with a defined secondary structure and a packed hydrophobic cluster of aromatic side chains our strategy is to observe the structural stability of the  hairpin under systematic perturbations of the turn region backbone hydrogen bonds and the hydrophobic core formed by the side chains respectively in our molecular dynamics simulations the peptides are solvated with explicit water molecules and an all atom force field cff  is used starting from the original peptide g ewtyddatktftvte   we carried out the following md simulations   unfolding at   k   forcing the distance between the c  atoms of asp  and lys  to be      deleting two turn residues ala  and thr  to form a  sheet complex of two short peptides gewtydd and ktftvte   four hydrophobic residues w  y  f  and t  are replaced by a glycine residue step by step and   most importantly four amide hydrogen atoms t  d  t  and t  which are crucial for backbone hydrogen bonding  are substituted by fluorine atoms the fluorination not only makes it impossible to form attractive hydrogen bonding between the two  hairpin strands but also introduces a repulsive force between the two strands due to the negative charges on the fluorine and oxygen atoms throughout all simulations we observe that backbone hydrogen bonds are very sensitive to the perturbations and are easily broken in contrast the hydrophobic core survives most perturbations in the decisive test of fluorination the fluorinated peptide remains folded under our simulation conditions  ns   k  hydrophobic interactions keep the peptide folded even with a repulsive force between the  strands thus our results strongly support a side chain centric view for protein folding
