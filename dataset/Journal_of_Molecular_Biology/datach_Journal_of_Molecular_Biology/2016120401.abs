molecular mechanism of dna topoisomerase i dependent rdna silencing sir p recruitment at ribosomal genes
saccharomyces cerevisiae sir  or top  mutants exhibit similar phenotypes involving ribosomal dna including i loss of transcriptional silencing resulting in non coding rna hyperproduction from cryptic rna polymerase ii promoters  ii alterations in recombination and iii a general increase in histone acetylation given the distinct enzymatic activities of sir and top proteins a histone deacetylase and a dna topoisomerase respectively we investigated whether genetic and or physical interactions between the two proteins could explain the shared ribosomal rna genes rdna phenotypes we employed an approach of complementing top  cells with yeast human truncated and chimeric yeast human top constructs and of assessing the extent of non coding rna silencing and histone h k  deacetylation our findings demonstrate that residues      within the yeast top p n terminal domain are required for the complementation of the top   rdna phenotypes in chromatin immunoprecipitation and co immunoprecipitation experiments we further demonstrate the physical interaction between top p and sir p our genetic and biochemical studies support a model whereby top p recruits sir p to the rdna and clarifies a structural role of dna topoisomerase i in the epigenetic regulation of rdna independent of its known catalytic activity
