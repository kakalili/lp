plasticity of the tsg  ha binding loop and mobility in the tsg  ha complex revealed by nmr and x ray crystallography
tumour necrosis factor stimulated gene  tsg  is a glycosaminoglycan binding protein expressed during inflammatory and inflammation like processes previously nmr structures were calculated for the link module of tsg  link tsg  in its free state and when bound to an octasaccharide of hyaluronan ha  heparin was found to compete for ha binding even though it interacts at a site that is distinct from the ha binding surface here we present crystallography data on the free protein and  n nmr relaxation data for the uncomplexed and ha bound forms of link tsg  although the link module is comparatively rigid overall the free protein shows a high degree of mobility in the     loop and at the cys   cys  disulfide bond both of which are regions involved in ha binding when bound to ha  this dynamic behaviour is dampened but not eliminated suggesting a degree of dynamic matching between the protein and sugar that may decrease the entropic penalty of complex formation a further highly dynamic residue is lys  which is distant from the ha binding site but was previously shown to be involved in heparin binding when ha is bound lys  becomes less mobile providing evidence for an allosteric effect linking the ha and heparin binding sites a mechanism is suggested involving the   strand and   helix the crystal structure of free link tsg contains five molecules in the asymmetric unit that are highly similar to the nmr structure and support the dynamic behaviour seen near the ha binding site they show little or no electron density for the     loop and display multiple conformations for the cys   cys  disulfide bond the crystal structures were used in docking calculations with heparin an extended interface between a link tsg dimer and heparin  mer was identified that is in excellent agreement with previous mutagenesis and calorimetric data providing the basis for further investigation of this interaction
