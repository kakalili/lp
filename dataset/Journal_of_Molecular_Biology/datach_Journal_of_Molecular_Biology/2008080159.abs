effect of flap mutations on structure of hiv  protease and inhibition by saquinavir and darunavir
hiv  human immunodeficiency virus type  protease pr and its mutants are important antiviral drug targets the pr flap region is critical for binding substrates or inhibitors and catalytic activity hence mutations of flap residues frequently contribute to reduced susceptibility to pr inhibitors in drug resistant hiv structural and kinetic analyses were used to investigate the role of flap residues gly  ile  and ile  in the development of drug resistance the crystal structures of flap mutants pri v pr with i v mutation  pri v pr with i v mutation  and pri m pr with i m mutation complexed with saquinavir sqv as well as prg v pr with g v mutation  pri v and pri m complexed with darunavir drv were determined at resolutions of         the pr mutants showed changes in flap conformation interactions with adjacent residues inhibitor binding and the conformation of the  s loop relative to the wild type pr the pr contacts with drv were closer in prg v  drv than in the wild type pr  drv whereas they were longer in pri m  drv the relative inhibition of pri v and that of pri m were similar for sqv and drv prg v was about twofold less susceptible to sqv than to drv whereas the opposite was observed for pri v the observed inhibition was in agreement with the association of g v and i v with clinical resistance to sqv and drv respectively this analysis of structural and kinetic effects of the mutants will assist in the development of more effective inhibitors for drug resistant hiv
