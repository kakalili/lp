structural analysis of lipid complexes of gm activator protein
the gm activator protein gm ap is a small lysosomal lipid transfer protein essential for the hydrolytic conversion of ganglioside gm to gm by  hexosaminidase a the crystal structure of human apo gm ap is known to consist of a novel  cup fold with a spacious hydrophobic interior here we present two new structures of gm ap with bound lipids showing two different lipid binding modes within the apolar pocket the    structure with gm bound shows the position of the ceramide tail and significant conformational differences among the three molecular copies in the asymmetric unit the tetrasaccharide head group is not visible and is presumed to be disordered however its general position could be established through modeling the structure of a low ph crystal determined at    resolution has a significantly enlarged hydrophobic channel that merges with the apolar pocket electron density inside the pocket and channel suggests the presence of a trapped phospholipid molecule structure alignments among the four crystallographically unique monomers provide information on the potential role for lipid binding of flexible chain segments at the rim of the cavity opening two discrete orientations of the s  t  loop define an open and a closed configuration of the hydrophobic channel that merges with the apolar pocket we propose  i that the low ph structure represents an active membrane binding conformation  ii that the mobile s  t  loop serves as a gate for passage of ligand into the apolar pocket and iii that this loop and the adjacent apolar v  w  loop form a surface patch with two exposed tryptophan residues that could interface with lipid bilayers
