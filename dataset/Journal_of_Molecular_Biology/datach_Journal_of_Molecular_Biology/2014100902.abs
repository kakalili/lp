histone methyltransferase ezh is transcriptionally induced by estradiol as well as estrogenic endocrine disruptors bisphenol a and diethylstilbestrol
enhancer of zeste homolog  ezh  a methyltransferase specific to histone  lysine   is a critical player in gene silencing and is overexpressed in breast cancer our studies demonstrate that ezh is transcriptionally induced by estradiol in cultured breast cancer cells and in the mammary glands of ovariectomized rats ezh promoter contains multiple functional estrogen response elements estrogen receptors ers and er coregulators such as mixed lineage leukemia mll histone methylases mll and mll  and histone acetyltransferase cbp p  bind to the ezh promoter in the presence of estradiol and regulate estradiol induced ezh expression ezh expression is also increased upon exposure to estrogenic endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs such as bisphenol a bpa and diethylstilbestrol des  similar to estradiol bpa and des induced ezh expression is coordinated by ers mlls and cbp p   in summary we demonstrate that ezh is transcriptionally regulated by estradiol in vitro and in vivo and its expression is potentially dysregulated upon exposure to estrogenic edcs
