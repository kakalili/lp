crystal structures of bchu a methyltransferase involved in bacteriochlorophyll c biosynthesis and its complex with s adenosylhomocysteine implications for reaction mechanism
bchu plays a role in bacteriochlorophyll c biosynthesis by catalyzing methylation at the c  position of cyclic tetrapyrrole chlorin using s adenosylmethionine sam as a methyl source this methylation causes red shifts of the electronic absorption spectrum of the light harvesting pigment allowing green photosynthetic bacteria to adapt to low light environments we have determined the crystal structures of bchu and its complex with s adenosylhomocysteine sah  bchu forms a dimer and each subunit consists of two domains an n terminal domain and a c terminal domain dimerization occurs through interactions between the n terminal domains and the residues responsible for the catalytic reaction are in the c terminal domain the binding site of sah is located in a large cavity between the two domains where sah is specifically recognized by many hydrogen bonds and a salt bridge the electron density map of bchu in complex with an analog of bacteriochlorophyll c located its central metal near the sah binding site but the tetrapyrrole ring was invisible suggesting that binding of the ring to bchu is loose and or occupancy of the ring is low it is likely that his  acts as a ligand for the central metal of the substrate the orientation of the substrate was predicted by simulation and allows us to propose a mechanism for the bchu directed methylation the strictly conserved tyr  residue acts catalytically in the direct transfer of the methyl group from sam to the substrate through an sn like mechanism
