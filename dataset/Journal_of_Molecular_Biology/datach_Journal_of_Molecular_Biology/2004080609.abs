the elongation and contraction of actin bundles are induced by double headed myosins in a motor concentration dependent manner
many types of myosin have been found and characterized to date and already nearly  classes have been identified however these myosin motors can be classified more simply into two groups according to their head structure i e double or single headed myosins why do some myosin motors possess a double headed structure one obvious possible reason would be that the two heads improve the motor s processivity and sliding performance previously to investigate the possibility that the double headed myosins simultaneously interact with parallel arrayed two actin filaments in the presence of mg atp we developed an in vitro assay system using actin bundles formed by inert polymers using that system we show here that skeletal muscle heavy meromyosin hmm  a double headed myosin derivative but not subfragment  s   a single headed one was able to contract or elongate actin bundles in a concentration dependent manner similar elongation or contraction of actin bundles can also be induced by other double headed myosin species isolated in the native state from dictyostelium from green algae chara or from chicken brain the results of this study confirm that double headed myosin motors can induce sliding movements among neighboring actin filaments the double headed structure of myosins may also be important for generating tension or elongation in actin bundles or gels and for organizing polarity sorted actin networks not just for improving their motor processivity or activity
