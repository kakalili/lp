combination of the loss of cmnm u  with the lack of s u  modifications of trnalys trnaglu and trnagln altered mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration
yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae mto  mto  and mss genes encoded highly conserved trna modifying enzymes for the biosynthesis of carboxymethylaminomethyl cmnm s u  in mitochondrial trnalys trnaglu and trnagln in fact mto p and mss p are involved in the biosynthesis of the cmnm group cmnm u   while mto p is responsible for the  thiouridylation s u  of these trnas previous studies showed that partial modifications at u  in mitochondrial trna enabled mto  mto  and mss strains to respire in this report we investigated the functional interaction between mto  mto  and mss genes by using the mto  mto  and mss single double and triple mutants strikingly the deletion of mto was synthetically lethal with a mutation of mss or deletion of mto on medium containing glycerol but not on medium containing glucose interestingly there were no detectable levels of nine trnas including trnalys trnaglu and trnagln in mto mss  mto mto  and mto mto mss strains furthermore mto mss  mto mto  and mto mto mss mutants exhibited extremely low levels of cox and cytb mrna and  s and  s rrna as well as the complete loss of mitochondrial protein synthesis the synthetic enhancement combinations likely resulted from the completely abolished modification at u  of trnalys trnaglu and trnagln caused by the combination of eliminating the  thiouridylation by the mto mutation with the absence of the cmnm u  by the mto or mss mutation the complete loss of modifications at u  of trnas altered mitochondrial rna metabolisms causing a degradation of mitochondrial trna mrna and rrnas as a result failures in mitochondrial rna metabolisms were responsible for the complete loss of mitochondrial translation consequently defects in mitochondrial protein synthesis caused the instability of their mitochondrial genomes thus producing the respiratory deficient phenotypes therefore our findings demonstrated a critical role of modifications at u  of trnalys trnaglu and trnagln in maintenance of mitochondrial genome mitochondrial rna stability translation and respiratory function
