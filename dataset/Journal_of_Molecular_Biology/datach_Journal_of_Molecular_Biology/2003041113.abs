quantitative nmr studies of high molecular weight proteins application to domain orientation and ligand binding in the   residue enzyme malate synthase g
a high resolution multidimensional nmr study of ligand binding to escherichia coli malate synthase g msg  a   residue monomeric enzyme   kda  is presented msg catalyzes the condensation of glyoxylate with an acetyl group of acetyl coa producing malate an intermediate in the citric acid cycle we show that despite the size of the protein important structural and dynamic information about the molecule can be obtained on a per residue basis  n  hn residual dipolar couplings and carbonyl chemical shift changes upon alignment in pf phage establish that there are no significant domain reorientations in the molecule upon ligand binding in contrast to what was anticipated on the basis of both the x ray structure of the glyoxylate bound form of the enzyme and structural studies of a related set of proteins the chemical shift changes of hn  n and  co nuclei upon binding of pyruvate a glyoxylate mimicking inhibitor and acetyl coa have been mapped onto the three dimensional structure of the molecule binding constants of pyruvate glyoxylate and acetyl coa in the presence of pyruvate have been measured along with the kinetic parameters for glyoxylate and pyruvate binding the on rates of pyruvate and glyoxalate binding       m  s   and      m  s   respectively are significantly lower than what is anticipated from a simple diffusion controlled process some structural implications of the chemical shift perturbations upon binding and the estimated ligand on rates are discussed
