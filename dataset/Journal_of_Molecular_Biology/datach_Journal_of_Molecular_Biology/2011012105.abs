mutant genetic background affects the functional rearrangement and kinetic properties of jmjd b histone demethylase
we have studied jmjd b histone demethylase which antagonizes h k me in the pericentromeric heterochromatin in cells with a deficiency in the histone methyltransferase suv h the level of full length jmjd b jmjd b gfp    at chromocenters was reduced corresponding to a global decrease in jmjd b and h k me  in wild type fibroblasts the chromatin of ribosomal genes which is dense with h k methylation lacked jmjd b gfp    while mutant and truncated forms of jmjd b densely occupied the nucleolar compartment this implies that the phd zn fingers and tudor domains which were removed in truncated jmjd b are responsible for the aberrant jmjd b function intriguingly the jmjd b gfp   level was significantly higher in tumor cell nucleoli the kinetic properties of jmjd b gfp   in the nucleoli and nucleoplasm of normal and tumor cells were similar     recovery of prebleached intensity was reached after lt  s however the mobile fraction of jmjd b gfp   was increased in suv h deficient cells similarly the mobile fractions of mutant jmjd b     h  a gfp and truncated jmjd b     gfp were greater than that measured for the full length protein we suggest that nucleoli are the site of an aberrant function of jmjd b the kinetic properties of which can be influenced by a mutant genetic background
