exploring the d molecular architecture of escherichia coli type  pili
an integrated approach combining information gained by fourier transformation linear markham superposition real space and mass per length measurement by scanning transmission electron microscopy was used to analyze the helical structure of the rod like type  pili expressed by uropathogenic escherichia coli strain w   the d reconstruction calculated from the experimental data showed the pili to be  nm wide right handed helical tubes with a       nm long helical repeat comprising  fima monomers associated head to tail in eight turns of the genetic one start helix adjacent turns of the genetic helix are connected via three binding sites making the pilus rod rather stiff in situ immuno electron microscopy experiments showed the minor subunit fimh mediating pilus adhesion to bladder epithelial cells to be the distal protein of the pilus tip which had a spring like appearance at higher magnification the subunits fimg and fimf connect fimh to the fima rod the sequential orientation being fima  fimf  fimg  fimh the electron density map calculated at   resolution from an atomic model of the pilus rod built using the pilin domain fimh together with the g strand of fimc as a template for fima and applying the optimal helical parameters determined to the head to tail interaction model for pilus assembly was practically identical with that of the actual d reconstruction
