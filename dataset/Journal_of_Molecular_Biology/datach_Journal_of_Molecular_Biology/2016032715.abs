trigger factor reduces the force exerted on the nascent chain by a cotranslationally folding protein
cotranslational protein folding can generate pulling forces on the nascent chain that can affect the instantaneous translation rate and thereby possibly feed back on the folding process such feedback would represent a new way of coupling translation and folding different from coupling based on for example codon usage however to date we have carried out the experiments used to measure pulling forces generated by cotranslational protein folding either in reconstituted in vitro translation systems lacking chaperones in ill defined cell lysates or in vivo hence the effects of chaperones on force generation by folding are unknown here we have studied the cotranslational folding of dihydrofolate reductase dhfr in the absence and in the presence of the chaperones trigger factor tf and groel es dhfr was tethered to the ribosome via a c terminal linker of varying length ending with the secm translational arrest peptide that serves as an intrinsic force sensor reporting on the force generated on the nascent chain when dhfr folds we find that dhfr folds into its native structure only when it has emerged fully outside the ribosome and that tf and groel alone substantially reduces the force generated on the nascent chain by the folding of dhfr while groel es has no effect tf therefore weakens the possible coupling between cotranslational folding and translation
