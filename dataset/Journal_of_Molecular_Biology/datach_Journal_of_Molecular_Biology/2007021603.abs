coliphage n n acetylmuramidase defines a new family of murein hydrolases
escherichia coli phage n infection leads to delayed host cell lysis    particles per infected bacterium and a small plaque phenotype we show that bacteriophage n encodes a murein hydrolase gp  that is essential for n plaque forming ability gp  has a high level of sequence similarity to hypothetical proteobacterial proteins and vibrio harveyi phage vhml orf   nano electrospray ionization nesi quadrupole ion trap qit mass spectrometry ms analysis of muropeptides from purified gp  digestion of e coli peptidoglycan indicates that gp  is an n acetylmuramidase the eggy motif present near the n terminus of gp  and its homologs contains the glutamic acid residue essential for enzymatic activity these results provide evidence that n gp  and its homologs define a new family of n acetylmuramidases pfam     duf   cog    in contrast to its homologs gp  contains an n terminal signal sequence when expressed at levels present during phage infection gp  localizes primarily to the cell inner membrane in contrast over expression of recombinant n gp  is sufficient for rapid cell lysis overproduction of the recombinant salmonella typhimurium stm   homolog is sufficient for cell lysis only when fused to the gp  n terminal signal sequence the results of subcellular localization and of mutagenesis of the gp  n terminal signal sequence indicate that gp  must be released from the inner membrane to be catalytically active
