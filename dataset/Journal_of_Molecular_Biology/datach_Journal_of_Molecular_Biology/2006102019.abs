binding induced stabilization and assembly of the phage p  tail accessory factor gp
to infect and replicate bacteriophage p  injects its   kbp genome across the cell wall of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium the attachment of phage p  to the host cell as well as the injection of the viral dna into the host is mediated by the virion s tail complex this   mda molecular machine is formed by five proteins which include the portal protein gp  the adhesion tailspike protein gp  and three tail accessory factors gp  gp  gp  we have isolated the tail accessory factor gp and characterized its structure and binding interactions with portal protein interestingly gp exists in solution as a monomer which displays an exceedingly low structural stability tm    c  unfolded gp is prone to aggregation within a narrow range of temperatures both in vitro and in salmonella extracts in the virion the thermal unfolding of gp is prevented by the interaction with the dodecameric portal protein which stabilizes the structure of gp and suppresses unfolded gp from irreversibly aggregating in the salmonella milieu the structural stabilization of gp is accompanied by the concomitant oligomerization of the protein to form a ring of  subunits bound to the lower end of the portal ring the interaction of gp with portal protein is complex and likely involves the distinct binding of two non equivalent sets of six gp proteins binding of the first set of six gp equivalents to dodecameric portal protein yields a gp   gp   assembly intermediate which is stably populated at    c and can be resolved by native gel electrophoresis the final product of the assembly reaction is a bi dodecameric gp   gp   complex which appears hollow by electron microscopy suggesting that gp does not physically plug the dna entry exit channel but acts as a structural adaptor for the other tail accessory factors gp  and gp
