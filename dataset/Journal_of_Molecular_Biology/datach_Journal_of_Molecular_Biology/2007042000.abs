the roles of tyr  and tyr  in rb  dna polymerase replication fidelity
in the family b dna polymerase of bacteriophage rb  the conserved aromatic palm subdomain residues tyr  and tyr  interact with the last primer  template base pair tyr  interacts via a water mediated hydrogen bond with the phosphate of the terminal primer nucleotide the main chain amide of tyr  interacts with the corresponding template nucleotide a hydrogen bond has been postulated between tyr  and the hydroxyl group of tyr   a residue that plays a key role in base discrimination this hydrogen bond may be crucial for forcing an infrequent tyr  rotamer conformation and when the bond is removed may influence fidelity we investigated the roles of these residues in replication fidelity in vivo employing phage t rii reversion assays and an ri forward assay tyr  was replaced by phe met and ala and tyr  by phe the y  a mutant reported previously to decrease polymerase affinity for incoming nucleotides was unable to support dna replication in vivo so we used an in vitro fidelity assay tyr  f m replacements affect fidelity only slightly implying that the bond with tyr  is not essential for fidelity the y  a enzyme has no mutator phenotype in vitro the y  f mutant displays a complex profile of impacts on fidelity but has almost the same mutational spectrum as the parental enzyme the y  f mutant displays reduced dna binding processivity and exonuclease activity on single stranded dna and double stranded dna substrates the y  f substitution would disrupt the hydrogen bond network at the primer terminus and may affect the alignment of the   primer terminus at the polymerase active site slowing chemistry and overall dna synthesis
