trichoderma reesei    mannosidase structural basis for the cleavage of four consecutive mannose residues edited by i a wilson
the process of n glycosylation of eukaryotic proteins involves a range of host enzymes that delete or add saccharide monomers while endoplasmic reticulum e r  mannosidases cleave only one mannose to produce the man b isomer an    mannosidase from trichoderma reesei can sequentially cleave all four   linked mannose sugars from a man glcnac oligosaccharide a feature reminiscent of the activity of golgi mannosidases we now report the structure of the t reesei enzyme at     resolution the enzyme folds as an     barrel the substrate binding site of the t reesei mannosidase differs appreciably from the saccharomyces cerevisiae enzyme in the former shorter loops at the surface allow substrate protein to come closer to the catalytic site there is more internal space available so that different oligosaccharide conformations are sterically allowed in the t reesei    mannosidase
