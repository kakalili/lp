the c terminal repeating units of csgb direct bacterial functional amyloid nucleation
curli are functional amyloids produced by enteric bacteria the major curli fiber subunit csga self assembles into an amyloid fiber in vitro the minor curli subunit protein csgb is required for csga polymerization on the cell surface both csga and csgb are composed of five predicted   strand  loop    strand  loop repeating units that feature conserved glutamine and asparagine residues because of this structural homology we proposed that csgb might form an amyloid template that initiates csga polymerization on the cell surface to test this model we purified wild type csgb and found that it self assembled into amyloid fibers in vitro preformed csgb fibers seeded csga polymerization as did soluble csgb added to the surface of cells secreting soluble csga to define the molecular basis of csgb nucleation we generated a series of mutants that removed each of the five repeating units each of these csgb deletion mutants was capable of self assembly in vitro in vivo membrane localized mutants lacking the first second or third repeating units were able to convert csga into fibers however mutants missing either the fourth or fifth repeating units were unable to complement a csgb mutant these mutant proteins were not localized to the outer membrane but were instead secreted into the extracellular milieu synthetic csgb peptides corresponding to repeating units    and  self  assembled into ordered amyloid polymers while peptides corresponding to repeating units  and  did not suggesting that there are redundant amyloidogenic domains in csgb our results suggest a model where the rapid conversion of csgb from unstructured protein to a  sheet rich amyloid template anchored to the cell surface is mediated by the c terminal repeating units
