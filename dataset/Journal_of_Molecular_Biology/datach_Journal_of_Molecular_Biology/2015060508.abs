immunoaffinity enrichment coupled to quantitative mass spectrometry reveals ubiquitin mediated signaling events
ubiquitination is one of the most prevalent posttranslational modifications in eukaryotic cells with functional importance in protein degradation subcellular localization and signal transduction pathways immunoaffinity enrichment coupled with quantitative mass spectrometry enables the in depth characterization of protein ubiquitination events at the site specific level we have applied this strategy to investigate cellular response triggered by two distinct type agents small molecule inhibitors of the tumor associated kinases mek and pi k or the pro inflammatory cytokine il   temporal profiling of protein ubiquitination events across a series of time points covering the biological response permits interrogation of signaling through thousands of quantified proteins of which only a subset display significant and physiologically meaningful regulation distinctive clusters of residues within proteins can display distinct temporal patterns attributable to diverse molecular functions although the majority of differential ubiquitination appears as a coordinated response across the modifiable residues present within an individual substrate in cells treated with a combination of mek and pi k inhibitors we found differential ubiquitination of mek within the first hour after treatment and a series of mitochondria proteins at later time points in the il  signaling pathway ubiquitination events on several signaling proteins including hoil  and tollip were observed the functional relevance of these putative il  mediators was subsequently validated by knockdown of hoil  hoip and tolip each of which decreased il  stimulated cytokine production together these data validate proteomic profiling of protein ubiquitination as a viable approach for identifying dynamic signaling components in response to intracellular and extracellular perturbations
