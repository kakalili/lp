crystal structures identify an atypical two metal ion mechanism for uridyltransfer in glmu its significance to sugar nucleotidyl transferases
n acetylglucosamine  phosphate uridyltransferase glmu  exclusive to prokaryotes is a bifunctional enzyme that synthesizes udp glcnac  an important component of the cell wall of many microorganisms uridyltransfer one of the reactions it catalyzes involves binding glcnac  p utp and mg  ions however whether one or two ions catalyze this reaction remains ambiguous here we resolve this using biochemical and crystallographic studies on glmu from mycobacterium tuberculosis glmumtb and identify a two metal ion mechanism mechanism b  in contrast to well established two metal mechanism mechanism a for enzymes acting on nucleic acids mechanism b is distinct in the way the two mg  ions mg a and mg b are positioned and stabilized further attempts to delineate the roles of the metal ions in substrate stabilization nucleophile activation and transition state stabilization are presented interestingly a detailed analysis of the available structures of sugar nucleotidyl transferases snts suggests that they too would utilize mechanism b rather than mechanism a based on this snts could be classified into group i which employs the two metal mechanism b as in glmu and group ii that employs a variant one metal mechanism b wherein the role of mg a is substituted by a conserved lysine strikingly eukaryotic snts appear confined to group ii recognizing these differences may be important in the design of selective inhibitors against microbial nucleotidyl transferases
