structural insights into the assembly and shape of type iii restriction  modification r  m ecop i complex by small angle x ray scattering
ecop i is the prototype of the type iii restriction enzyme family composed of two modification mod subunits to which two or one restriction res subunits are then added the mod subunits are responsible for dna recognition and methylation while the res subunits are responsible for atp hydrolysis and cleavage despite extensive biochemical and genetic studies there is still no structural information on type iii restriction enzymes we present here small angle x ray scattering saxs and analytical ultracentrifugation analysis of the ecop i holoenzyme and the mod subcomplex we show that the mod subcomplex has a relatively compact shape with a radius of gyration rg of       and a maximal dimension of       the holoenzyme adopts an elongated crescent shape with an rg of       and a maximal dimension of       from reconstructed saxs envelopes we postulate that mod is likely docked in the middle of the holoenzyme with a res subunit at each end we discuss the implications of our model for ecop i action whereby the res subunits may come together and form a  sliding clamp  around the dna
