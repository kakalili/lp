a general method to quantify quasi equivalence in icosahedral viruses
a quantitative atom based method is described for comparing protein subunit interfaces in icosahedral virus capsids with quasi equivalent surface lattices an integrated normalized value between  and  based on equivalent residue contacts q score is computed for every pair of subunit interactions and scores that are significantly above zero readily identify interfaces that are quasi equivalent to each other the method was applied to all quasi equivalent capsid structures t     and   in the protein data bank and the q scores were interpreted in terms of their structural underpinnings the analysis allowed classification of t  structures into three groups with architectures that resemble different polyhedra with icosahedral symmetry the preference of subunits to form dimers in the t  human hepatitis b virus capsid hbv was clearly reflected in high q scores of quasi equivalent dimers interesting differences between the classical t  capsid and polyoma like capsids were also identified application of the method to the outer shell of the t  blue tongue virus core btvc highlighted the modest distortion between the interfaces of the general trimers and the strict trimers of vp subunits furthermore the method identified the quasi  fold symmetry in the inner capsids of the btv and reovirus cores the results show that the q scores of various quasi symmetries represent a  fingerprint  for a particular virus capsid architecture allowing particle classification into groups based on their underlying structural and geometric features
