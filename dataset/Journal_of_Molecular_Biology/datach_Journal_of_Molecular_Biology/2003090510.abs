structural basis of the carbohydrate specificities of jacalin an x ray and modeling study
the structures of the complexes of tetrameric jacalin with gal me  galnac me  t antigen galnac   gal  o me and gal   glc mellibiose show that the sugar binding site of jacalin has three components the primary site secondary site a and secondary site b in these structures and in the two structures reported earlier gal or galnac occupy the primary site with the anomeric carbon pointing towards secondary site a the  substituents when present interact primarily hydrophobically with secondary site a which has variable geometry o  h   and c  h   hydrogen bonds involving this site also exist on the other hand   substitution leads to severe steric clashes therefore in complexes involving  linked disaccharides the reducing sugar binds at the primary site with the non reducing end located at secondary site b the interactions at secondary site b are primarily through water bridges thus the nature of the linkage determines the mode of the association of the sugar with jacalin the interactions observed in the crystal structures and modeling based on them provide a satisfactory qualitative explanation of the available thermodynamic data on jacalin  carbohydrate interactions they also lead to fresh insights into the nature of the binding of glycoproteins by jacalin
