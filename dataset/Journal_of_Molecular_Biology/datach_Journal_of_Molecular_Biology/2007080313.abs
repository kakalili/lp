spackling the crack stabilizing human fibroblast growth factor  by targeting the n and c terminus  strand interactions
the  trefoil protein human fibroblast growth factor  fgf  is made up of a six stranded antiparallel  barrel closed off on one end by three  hairpins thus exhibiting a  fold axis of structural symmetry the n and c terminus  strands hydrogen bond to each other and their interaction is postulated from both nmr and x ray structure data to be important in folding and stability specific mutations within the adjacent n and c terminus  strands of fgf  are shown to provide a substantial increase in stability this increase is largely correlated with an increased folding rate constant and with a smaller but significant decrease in the unfolding rate constant a series of stabilizing mutations are subsequently combined and result in a doubling of the  g value of unfolding when taken in the context of previous studies of stabilizing mutations the results indicate that although fgf  is known for generally poor thermal stability the  trefoil architecture appears capable of substantial thermal stability targeting stabilizing mutations within the n and c terminus  strand interactions of a  barrel architecture may be a generally useful approach to increase protein stability such stabilized mutations of fgf  are shown to exhibit significant increases in effective mitogenic potency and may prove useful as  second generation  forms of fgf  for application in angiogenic therapy
