regulation of directionality in bacteriophage  site specific recombination structure of the xis protein
upon induction of a bacteriophage  lysogen a site specific recombination reaction excises the phage genome from the chromosome of its bacterial host a critical regulator of this process is the phage encoded excisionase xis protein which functions both as a dna architectural factor and by cooperatively recruiting integrase to an adjacent binding site specifically required for excision here we present the three dimensional structure of xis and the results of a structure based mutagenesis study to define the molecular basis of its function xis adopts an unusual  winged  helix motif that is modeled to interact with the major and minor grooves of its binding site through a single  helix and loop structure   wing   respectively the c terminal tail of xis which is required for cooperative binding with integrase is unstructured in the absence of dna we propose that asymmetric bending of dna by xis positions its unstructured c terminal tail for direct contacts with the n terminal dna binding domain of integrase and that an ensuing disordered to ordered transition of the tail may act to stabilize the formation of the tripartite integrase  xis  dna complex required for phage excision
