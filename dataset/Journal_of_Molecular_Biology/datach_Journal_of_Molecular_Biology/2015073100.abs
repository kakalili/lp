limited proteolysis reveals that amyloids from the d domain swapping cystatin b have a non native  sheet topology
d domain swapping proteins form multimers by unfolding and then sharing of secondary structure elements often with native like interactions runaway domain swapping is proposed as a mechanism for folded proteins to form amyloid fibres with examples including serpins and cystatins cystatin c amyloids cause a hereditary form of cerebral amyloid angiopathy whilst cystatin b aggregates are found in cases of unverricht lundborg syndrome a progressive form of myoclonic epilepsy under conditions that favour fibrillisation cystatins populate stable d domain swapped dimers both in vitro and in vivo that represent intermediates on route to the formation of fibrils previous work on cystatin b amyloid fibrils revealed that the  helical region of the protein becomes disordered and identified the conservation of a continuous  residue elongated  strand residues      the latter being a salient feature of the dimeric d domain swapped structure here we apply limited proteolysis to cystatin b amyloid fibrils and show that not only the  helical n terminal of the protein residues     but also the c terminal of the protein residues     can be removed without disturbing the underlying fibril structure this observation is incompatible with previous models of cystatin amyloid fibrils where the  sheet is assumed to retain its native antiparallel arrangement we conclude that our data favour a more generic at least partially parallel arrangement for cystatin  sheet structure in mature amyloids and propose a model that remains consistent with available data for amyloids from either cystatin b or cystatin c
