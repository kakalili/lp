adp binding to origin recognition complex of saccharomyces cerevisiae
the origin recognition complex orc  a possible initiator of chromosomal dna replication in eukaryotes binds to atp through its subunits orc p and orc p orc p possesses atpase activity as for dnaa the escherichia coli initiator the atp  dnaa complex is active but the adp  dnaa complex is inactive for dna replication and therefore the atpase activity of dnaa inactivates the atp  dnaa complex to suppress the re initiation of chromosomal dna replication we investigated adp binding to orc by a filter binding assay the kd values for adp binding to wild type orc and to orc a orc containing orc p with a defective walker a motif were less than  nm showing that orc p can bind to adp with a high affinity similar to atp orc a orc containing orc p with a defective walker a motif did not bind to adp suggesting that the adp  orc p complex is too unstable to be detected by the filter binding assay adp dissociated more rapidly than atp from wild type orc and orc a origin dna fragments did not stimulate adp binding to any type of orc in the presence of adp orc could not bind to origin dna in a sequence specific manner thus in eukaryotes the adp  orc complex may be unable to initiate chromosomal dna replication and in this it resembles the adp  dnaa complex in prokaryotes however overall control may be different in eukaryotes the adp  orc complex is unstable suggesting that the adp  orc complex might rapidly become an atp  orc complex whereas in prokaryotes adp remains bound to dnaa keeping dnaa inactive and preventing re initiation for some periods
