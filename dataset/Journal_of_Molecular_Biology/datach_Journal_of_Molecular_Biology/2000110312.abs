deuterium proton exchange on the native wild type transthyretin tetramer identifies the stable core of the individual subunits and indicates mobility at the subunit interface edited by p e wright
transthyretin is a human protein capable of amyloid formation that is believed to cause several types of amyloid disease depending on the sequence deposited previous studies have demonstrated that wild type transthyretin ttr  although quite stable forms amyloid upon dissociation from its native tetrameric form into monomers with an altered conformation many naturally occurring single site variants of ttr display decreased stability in vitro manifested by the early onset familial amyloid diseases in vivo only subtle structural changes were observed in x ray crystallographic structures of these disease associated variants in this study the stability of the wild type ttr tetramer was investigated at the residue resolution level by monitoring h h exchange via nmr spectroscopy the measured protection factors for slowly exchanging amide hydrogen atoms reveal a stable core consisting of strands a b e f and interestingly the loop between strands a and b in addition the faster exchange of amide groups from residues at the subunit interfaces suggests unexpected mobility in these regions this information is crucial for future comparisons between disease associated and wild type tetramers such studies can directly address the regions of ttr that become destabilized as a consequence of single amino acid substitutions providing clues to aspects of ttr amyloidogenesis
