the tertiary structure at     resolution and the proposed amino acid sequence of a family  xylanase from the thermophilic fungus paecilomyces varioti bainier edited by a klug
we report the crystal structure at     and the proposed amino acid sequence of an endo    xylanase pvx from the thermophilic fungus paecilomyces varioti bainier pvb  stable up to   c this fungus is attracting clinical attention as a pathogen causing post surgical infections its xylanase known as a skin contact allergen is the first protein from this fungus whose three dimensional structure has been elucidated the crystals of pvx conform to the space group p    with a       b      and c       the structure was solved by molecular replacement techniques using polyalanine coordinates of the thermomyces lanuginosus xylanase pdb code yna and a careful model building based on the amino acid sequence known for two trypsin digested peptide fragments   residues  the sequence and structural alignment of family  xylanases and electron density maps the final refined model has   amino acid residues and   water molecules with a crystallographic r factor of     and a free r factor of     the structure belongs to an all  fold with two curved  sheets forming the cylindrical active site cleft and a lone  helix as present in other family  xylanases we have carried out a quantitative comparison of the structure and sequence of the present thermophilic xylanase pvx with other available native structures of mesophiles and thermophiles the first such detailed analysis to be carried out on family  xylanases the analysis provides a basis for the rationalisation of the idea that the  hinge  region is made more compact in thermophiles by the addition of a disulphide bridge between cys  and cys  and a n h   o hydrogen bond between trp  near the extremity of the lone  helix and trp  on  strand b  this work brings out explicitly the presence of the c h   o and the c h     type interactions in these enzymes a complete description of structural stability of these enzymes needs to take account of these weaker interactions
