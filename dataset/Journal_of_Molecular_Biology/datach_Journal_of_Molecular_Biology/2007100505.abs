the putative dna binding protein sto a from the thermoacidophilic archaeon sulfolobus tokodaii contains intrachain and interchain disulfide bonds
the sto a protein from the thermoacidophilic archaeon sulfolobus tokodaii has been identified as a small putative dna binding protein most of the proteins with a high level of amino acid sequence homology to this protein are derived from members of the sulfolobaceae family including a transcriptional regulator we determined the crystal structure of sto a at     resolution by multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing from the selenomethionine containing protein crystal this is the first structure of a member of this family of dna binding proteins the sto a protein forms a homodimer and the structure is composed of an n terminal  helix a winged helix  turn  helix domain and a c terminal  helix that forms an interchain antiparallel coiled coil the two winged helix domains are located at both ends of the coiled coil with putative dna recognition helices separated by approximately     a structural homology search indicated that the winged helix domain shared a high level of homology with those found in b dna or z dna binding proteins from various species including archaea bacteria and human despite a low level of sequence similarity the unique structural features of the sto a protein include intrachain and interchain disulfide bonds which stabilize the chain and homodimer structures there are three cysteine residues cys  and cys  in the n terminal  helix and cys  in the c terminal  helix cys  is involved in an interchain disulfide bridge with the other cys  and cys  forms an intrachain disulfide bridge with cys   this is a novel fold among winged helix dna binding proteins possible dna binding interactions of the sto a protein are discussed based on the crystal structure of sto a and comparisons to other winged helix dna binding proteins
