side chain dynamics of the sap sh domain correlate with a binding hot spot and a region with conformational plasticity
x linked lymphoproliferative disease is caused by mutations in the protein sap which consists almost entirely of a single sh domain sap interacts with the tyr  site of the t  b cell signaling protein slam via its sh domain interestingly binding is not dependent on phosphorylation but does involve interactions with residues n terminal to the tyr we have used  n and h nmr relaxation experiments to investigate the motional properties of the sap sh domain backbone amides and side chain methyl groups in the free protein and complexes with phosphorylated and non phosphorylated peptides derived from the tyr  site of slam the most mobile methyl groups are in side chains with large rmsd values between the three crystal structures of sap suggesting that fast time scale dynamics in side chains is associated with conformational plasticity the backbone amides of two residues which interact with the c terminal part of the peptides experience fast time scale motions in the free sh domain that are quenched upon binding of either the phosphorylated or non phosphorylated peptide of most importance the mobility of methyl groups in and around the binding site for residues in the n terminus of the peptide is significantly restricted in the complexes underscoring the dominance of this interaction with sap and demonstrating a correlation between changes in rapid side chain motion upon binding with local binding energy
