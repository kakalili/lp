binding of atp to tk like enzymes is associated with a conformational change in the quaternary structure
human thymidine kinase  htk  and structurally related tks from other organisms catalyze the initial phosphorylation step in the thymidine salvage pathway though atp is known to be the preferred phosphoryl donor for tk like enzymes its exact binding mode and effect on the oligomeric state has not been analyzed here we report the structures of htk and of the thermotoga maritima thymidine kinase tmtk in complex with the bisubstrate inhibitor tp a the tmtk tp a structure reveals that the adenosine moiety of atp binds at the subunit interface of the homotetrameric enzyme and that the majority of the atp  enzyme interactions occur between the phosphate groups and the p loop in the htk structure the adenosine group of tp a exhibited no electron density this difference between htk and tmtk is rationalized by a difference in the conformation of their quaternary structure a more open conformation as seen in the tmtk tp a complex structure is required to provide space for the adenosine moiety our analysis supports the formation of an analogous open conformation in htk upon atp binding
