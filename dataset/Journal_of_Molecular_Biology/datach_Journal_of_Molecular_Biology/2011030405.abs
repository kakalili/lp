probing membrane protein unfolding with pulse proteolysis
technical challenges have greatly impeded the investigation of membrane protein folding and unfolding to develop a new tool that facilitates the study of membrane proteins we tested pulse proteolysis as a probe for membrane protein unfolding pulse proteolysis is a method to monitor protein folding and unfolding which exploits the significant difference in proteolytic susceptibility between folded and unfolded proteins this method requires only a small amount of protein and in many cases may be used with unpurified proteins in cell lysates to evaluate the effectiveness of pulse proteolysis as a probe for membrane protein unfolding we chose halobacterium halobium bacteriorhodopsin br as a model system the denaturation of br in sds has been investigated extensively by monitoring the change in the absorbance at   nm a   in this work we demonstrate that denaturation of br by sds results in a significant increase in its susceptibility to proteolysis by subtilisin when pulse proteolysis was applied to br incubated in varying concentrations of sds the remaining intact protein determined by electrophoresis shows a cooperative transition the midpoint of the cooperative transition cm shows excellent agreement with that determined by a   the cm values determined by pulse proteolysis for m a and y a brs are also consistent with the measurements made by a   our results suggest that pulse proteolysis is a quantitative tool to probe membrane protein unfolding combining pulse proteolysis with western blotting may allow the investigation of membrane protein unfolding in situ without overexpression or purification
