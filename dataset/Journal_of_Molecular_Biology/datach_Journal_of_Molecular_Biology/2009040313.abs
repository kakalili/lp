structural and functional analysis of sopip  mutants adds insight into plant aquaporin gating
plant plasma membrane aquaporins facilitate water flux into and out of plant cells thus coupling their cellular function to basic aspects of plant physiology posttranslational modifications of conserved phosphorylation sites changes in cytoplasmic ph and the binding of ca  can regulate water transport activity by gating the plasma membrane aquaporins a structural mechanism unifying these diverse biochemical signals has emerged for the spinach aquaporin sopip   although several questions concerning the opening mechanism remain here we describe the x ray structures of the s  e and s  e single sopip  mutants and the corresponding double mutant phosphorylation of these serines is believed to increase water transport activity of sopip  by opening the channel however all mutants crystallised in a closed conformation as confirmed by water transport assays implying that neither substitution fully mimics the phosphorylated state nevertheless a half turn extension of transmembrane helix  occurs upon the substitution of ser   which draws the c  atom of glu     away from its wild type conformation thereby disrupting the divalent cation binding site involved in the gating mechanism mutation of ser  disorders the c terminus but no other significant conformational changes are observed inspection of the hydrogen bond interactions within loop d suggested that the phosphorylation of ser  may also produce an open channel and this was supported by an increased water transport activity for the s  e mutant and molecular dynamics simulations these findings add additional insight into the general mechanism of plant aquaporin gating
