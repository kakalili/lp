replication factor c from the hyperthermophilic archaeon pyrococcus abyssi does not need atp hydrolysis for clamp loading and contains a functionally conserved rfc pcna binding domain
the molecular organization of the replication complex in archaea is similar to that in eukaryotes only two proteins homologous to subunits of eukaryotic replication factor c rfc have been detected in pyrococcus abyssi pab  the genes encoding these two proteins are arranged in tandem we cloned these two genes and co expressed the corresponding recombinant proteins in escherichia coli two inteins present in the gene encoding the small subunit pabrfc small were removed during cloning the recombinant protein complex was purified by anion exchange and hydroxyapatite chromatography also the pabrfc small subunit could be purified while the large subunit pabrfc large alone was completely insoluble the highly purified pabrfc complex possessed an atpase activity which was not enhanced by dna the pab proliferating cell nuclear antigen pcna activated the pabrfc complex in a dna dependent manner but the pabrfc small atpase activity was neither dna dependent nor pcna dependent the pabrfc complex was able to stimulate pabpcna dependent dna synthesis by the pabfamily d heterodimeric dna polymerase finally  i the pabrfc large fraction cross reacted with anti human rfc pcna binding domain antibody corroborating the conservation of the protein sequence  ii the human pcna stimulated the pabrfc complex atpase activity in a dna dependent way and iii the pabrfc complex could load human pcna onto primed single stranded circular dna suggesting that the pcna binding domain of rfc has been functionally conserved during evolution in addition atp hydrolysis was not required either for dna polymerase stimulation or pcna loading in vitro
