translation of mrnas from vesicular stomatitis virus and vaccinia virus is differentially blocked in cells with depletion of eif gi and or eif gii
cytolytic viruses abrogate host protein synthesis to maximize the translation of their own mrnas in this study we analyzed the eukaryotic initiation factor eif  g requirement for translation of vesicular stomatitis virus vsv and vaccinia virus vv mrnas in hela cells using two different strategies eif g depletion by small interfering rnas or cleavage of eif g by expression of poliovirus a protease depletion of eif gi or eif gii moderately inhibits cellular protein synthesis whereas silencing of both factors has only a slightly higher effect under these conditions the extent of vsv protein synthesis is similar to that of nondepleted control cells whereas vv expression is substantially reduced similar results were obtained when eif e was depleted on the other hand eif g cleavage by poliovirus a protease strongly inhibits translation of vv protein expression whereas translation directed by vsv mrnas is not abrogated even though vsv mrnas are capped therefore the requirement for eif f activity is different for vv and vsv suggesting that the molecular mechanism by which their mrnas initiate their translation is also different consistent with these findings eif gi does not colocalize with ribosomes in vsv infected cells while eif  locates at perinuclear sites coincident with ribosomes
