structure of the filamentous phage piv multimer by cryo electron microscopy
the homo multimeric piv protein constitutes a channel required for the assembly and export of filamentous phage across the outer membrane of escherichia coli we present a   resolution three dimensional reconstruction of detergent solubilized piv by cryo electron microscopy associated with image analysis the structure reveals a barrel like complex   nm in diameter and  nm in length with d  point group symmetry consisting of a dimer of unit multimers side views of each unit multimer exhibit three cylindrical domains named the n ring the m ring and the c ring gold labeling of piv engineered to contain a single cysteine residue near the n or c terminus unambiguously identified the n terminal region as the n ring and the c terminal region was inferred to make up the c ring a large pore ranging in inner diameter from  nm to  nm runs through the middle of the multimer but a central domain the pore gate blocks it moreover the pore diameter at the n ring is smaller than the phage particle we therefore propose that the piv multimer undergoes a large conformational change during phage transport with reorganization of the central domain to open the pore and widening at the n ring in order to accommodate the  nm diameter phage particle
