Transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2), a homologue of the classical transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), is found in two isoforms, α and β. Like TfR1, TfR2α is a type II membrane protein, but the β form lacks transmembrane portions and therefore is likely to be an intracellular protein. To investigate the functional properties of TfR2α, we expressed the protein with FLAG tagging in transferrin-receptor-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells. The association constant for the binding of diferric transferrin (Tf) to TfR2α is 5.6×106 M−1, which is about 50 times lower than that for the binding of Tf to TfR1, with correspondingly reduced rates of iron uptake. Evidence for Tf internalization and recycling via TfR2α without degradation, as in the TfR1 pathway, was also found. The interaction of TfR2α with Tf was further investigated using atomic force microscopy, a powerful tool used for investigating the interaction between a ligand and its receptor at the single-molecule level on the living cell surface. Dynamic force microscopy reveals a difference in the interactions of Tf with TfR2α and TfR1, with Tf–TfR1 unbinding characterized by two energy barriers, while only one is present for Tf–TfR2. We speculate that this difference may reflect Tf binding to TfR2α by a single lobe, whereas two lobes of Tf participate in binding to TfR1. The difference in the binding properties of Tf to TfR1 and TfR2α may help account for the different physiological roles of the two receptors.
