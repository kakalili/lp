structural insight into the mechanism of substrate specificity and catalytic activity of an hd domain phosphohydrolase the   deoxyribonucleotidase yfbr from escherichia coli
hd domain phosphohydrolases have nucleotidase and phosphodiesterase activities and play important roles in the metabolism of nucleotides and in signaling we present three    resolution crystal structures one in the free state and two complexed with natural substrates of an hd domain phosphohydrolase the escherichia coli   nucleotidase yfbr the free state structure of yfbr contains a large cavity accommodating the metal coordinating hd motif h  h  d  and d   and other conserved residues r  e  and d   alanine scanning mutagenesis confirms that these residues are important for activity two structures of the catalytically inactive mutant e a complexed with co  and either thymidine   monophosphate or   deoxyriboadenosine   monophosphate disclose the novel binding mode of deoxyribonucleotides in the active site residue r  stabilizes the phosphate on the co  and residue d  forms a strong hydrogen bond critical for binding the ribose the indole side chain of w  is located close to the   carbon atom of the deoxyribose moiety and is proposed to act as the selectivity switch for deoxyribonucleotide which is supported by comparison to yfdr another   nucleotidase in e coli the nucleotide bases of both deoxyriboadenosine   monophosphate and thymidine   monophosphate make no specific hydrogen bonds with the protein explaining the lack of nucleotide base selectivity the yfbr e a substrate complex structures also suggest a plausible single step nucleophilic substitution mechanism this is the first proposed molecular mechanism for an hd domain phosphohydrolase based directly on substrate bound crystal structures
