how hsp  molecular machines interact with their substrates to mediate diverse physiological functions
hsp  molecular chaperones are implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes including protein biogenesis protection of the proteome from stress recovery of proteins from aggregates facilitation of protein translocation across membranes and more specialized roles such as disassembly of particular protein complexes it is a fascinating question to ask how the mechanism of these deceptively simple molecular machines is matched to their roles in these wide ranging processes the key is a combination of the nature of the recognition and binding of hsp  substrates and the impact of hsp  action on their substrates in many cases the binding which relies on interaction with an extended accessible short hydrophobic sequence favors more unfolded states of client proteins the atp mediated dissociation of the substrate thus releases it in a relatively less folded state for downstream folding membrane translocation or hand off to another chaperone there are cases such as regulation of the heat shock response or disassembly of clathrin coats however where binding of a short hydrophobic sequence selects conformational states of clients to favor their productive participation in a subsequent step this perspective discusses current understanding of how hsp  molecular chaperones recognize and act on their substrates and the relationships between these fundamental processes and the functional roles played by these molecular machines
