dissecting ngf interactions with trka and p  receptors by structural and functional studies of an anti ngf neutralizing antibody
the anti nerve growth factor ngf monoclonal antibody  d  is a potent antagonist that neutralizes the biological functions of its antigen in vivo ngf antagonism is expected to be a highly effective and safe therapeutic approach in many pain states a comprehensive functional and structural analysis of  d  monoclonal antibody was carried out showing its ability to neutralize ngf binding to either tropomyosine receptor kinase a trka or p  receptors the  d structure of the  d  fab fragment was solved at     resolution a computational docking model of the  d  fab  ngf complex based on epitope mapping using a pool of  ngf mutants and experimentally validated by small angle x ray scattering provided the structural basis for identifying the residues involved in  d  fab binding the present study pinpoints loop ii of ngf to be an important structural determinant for ngf biological activity mediated by trka receptor
