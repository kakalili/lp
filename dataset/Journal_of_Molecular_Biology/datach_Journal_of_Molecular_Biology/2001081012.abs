automated structure based prediction of functional sites in proteins applications to assessing the validity of inheriting protein function from homology in genome annotation and to protein docking edited by g von heijne
a major problem in genome annotation is whether it is valid to transfer the function from a characterised protein to a homologue of unknown activity here we show that one can employ a strategy that uses a structure based prediction of protein functional sites to assess the reliability of functional inheritance we have automated and benchmarked a method based on the evolutionary trace approach using a multiple sequence alignment we identified invariant polar residues which were then mapped onto the protein structure spatial clusters of these invariant residues formed the predicted functional site for  of  proteins examined the method yielded information about the observed functional site this algorithm for functional site prediction was then used to assess the validity of transferring the function between homologues this procedure was tested on  pairs of homologous proteins with unrelated function and  pairs of proteins with related function and was shown to be   accurate this automated method could be linked to schemes for genome annotation finally we examined the use of functional site prediction in protein protein and protein dna docking the use of predicted functional sites was shown to filter putative docked complexes with a discrimination similar to that obtained by manually including biological information about active sites or dna binding residues
