locating herpesvirus bcl  homologs in the specificity landscape of anti apoptotic bcl  proteins
viral homologs of the anti apoptotic bcl  proteins are highly diverged from their mammalian counterparts yet they perform overlapping functions by binding and inhibiting bh  bcl  homology  motif containing proteins we investigated the bh binding properties of the herpesvirus bcl  homologs ksbcl  bhrf  and m  as they relate to those of the human bcl  homologs mcl  bfl  bcl w bcl xl and bcl  analysis of the sequence and structure of the bh binding grooves showed that despite low sequence identity m  has structural similarities to bcl xl bcl  and bcl w bhrf and ksbcl  are more structurally similar to mcl  than to the other human proteins binding to human bh like peptides showed that ksbcl  has similar specificity to mcl  and bhrf has a restricted binding profile m  binding preferences are distinct from those of bcl xl bcl  and bcl w because ksbcl  and bhrf are from human herpesviruses associated with malignancies we screened computationally designed bh peptide libraries using bacterial surface display to identify selective binders of ksbcl  or bhrf  the resulting peptides bound to ksbcl  and bhrf in preference to bfl  bcl w bcl xl and bcl  but showed only modest specificity over mcl  rational mutagenesis increased specificity against mcl  resulting in a peptide with a dissociation constant of  nm for binding to ksbcl  and gt   fold specificity over other bcl  proteins as well as a peptide with gt  fold specificity for bhrf  in addition to providing new insights into viral bcl  binding specificity this study will inform future work analyzing the interaction properties of homologous binding domains and designing specific protein interaction partners
