dimeric crystal structure of rabbit l gulonate  dehydrogenase  crystallin insights into the catalytic mechanism
l gulonate  dehydrogenase gdh is a bifunctional dimeric protein that functions not only as an nad dependent enzyme in the uronate cycle but also as a taxon specific  crystallin in rabbit lens here we report the first crystal structure of gdh in both apo form and nadh bound holo form the gdh protomer consists of two structural domains the n terminal domain with a rossmann fold and the c terminal domain with a novel helical fold in the n terminal domain of the nadh bound structure we identified  coenzyme binding residues and found  distinct side chain conformers of ser   which is a putative coenzyme substrate binding residue a structural comparison between apo form and holo form and a mutagenesis study with e q mutant suggest an induced fit mechanism upon coenzyme binding coenzyme binding induces a conformational change in the coenzyme binding residues glu  and ser  to switch their activation state from resting to active which is required for the subsequent substrate recruitment subunit dimerization is mediated by numerous intersubunit interactions including  hydrogen bonds and   residue pairs of van der waals interactions of which those between two cognate c terminal domains are predominant from a structure sequence comparison within gdh homologues a much greater degree of interprotomer interactions both polar and hydrophobic in the rabbit gdh would contribute to its higher thermostability which may be relevant to the other function of this enzyme as  crystallin a constitutive structural protein in rabbit lens the present crystal structures and amino acid mutagenesis studies assigned the role of active site residues catalytic base for his  and substrate binding for ser   cys   asn   and arg   notably arg  participates in substrate binding from the other subunit of the gdh dimer indicating the functional significance of the dimeric state proper orientation of the substrate binding residues for catalysis is likely to be maintained by an interprotomer hydrogen bonding network of residues asn   gln   and arg   suggesting a network based substrate recognition of gdh
