architecture of the herpes simplex virus major capsid protein derived from structural bioinformatics
the dispositions of    helices of greater than   turns and four  sheets in the major capsid protein vp    kda of herpes simplex virus type  were identified by computational and visualization analysis from the    electron cryomicroscopy structure of the whole capsid the assignment of helices in the vp upper domain was validated by comparison with the recently determined crystal structure of this region analysis of the spatial arrangement of helices in the middle domain of vp revealed that the organization of a tightly associated bundle of ten helices closely resembled that of a domain fold found in the annexin family of proteins structure based sequence searches suggested that sequences in both the n and c terminal portions of the vp sequence contribute to this domain the long helices seen in the floor domain of vp form an interconnected network within and across capsomeres the combined structural and sequence based informatics has led to an architectural model of vp  this model placed in the context of the capsid provides insights into the strategies used to achieve viral capsid stability
