function of the neurospora crassa mitochondrial tyrosyl trna synthetase in rna splicing role of the idiosyncratic n terminal extension and different modes of interaction with different group i introns edited by d e draper
the neurospora crassa mitochondrial tyrosyl trna synthetase cyt  protein promotes the splicing of group i introns by helping the intron rna fold into the catalytically active structure the regions required for splicing include an idiosyncratic n terminal extension the nucleotide binding fold domain and the c terminal rna binding domain here we show that the idiosyncratic n terminal region is in fact comprised of two functionally distinct parts an upstream region consisting predominantly of a predicted amphipathic  helix h  which is absent from bacterial tyrosyl trna synthetases tyrrss  and a downstream region which contains predicted  helices h and h  corresponding to features in the x ray crystal structure of the bacillus stearothermophilus tyrrs bacterial genetic assays with libraries of cyt  mutants having random mutations in the n terminal region identified functionally important amino acid residues and supported the predicted structures of the h and h   helices the function of n and c terminal domains of cyt  was investigated by detailed biochemical analysis of deletion mutants the results confirmed that the n terminal extension is required only for splicing activity but surprisingly at least in the case of the n crassa mitochondrial mt large ribosomal subunit lsu intron it appears to act primarily by stabilizing the structure of another region that interacts directly with the intron rna the h h region is required for splicing activity and tyrrs activity with the n crassa mt trnatyr but not for tyrrs activity with escherichia coli trnatyr implying a somewhat different mode of recognition of the two tyrosyl trnas finally a cyt  mutant lacking the n terminal h region is totally defective in binding or splicing the n crassa nd intron but retains substantial residual activity with the mt lsu intron and conversely a cyt  mutant lacking the c terminal rna binding domain is totally defective in binding or splicing the mt lsu intron but retains substantial residual activity with the nd intron these findings lead to the surprising conclusion that cyt  promotes splicing via different sets of interactions with different group i introns we suggest that these different modes of promoting splicing evolved from an initial interaction based on the recognition of conserved trna like structural features of the group i intron catalytic core
