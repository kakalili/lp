structural and functional studies of titin  s fn modules reveal conserved surface patterns and binding to myosin s  a possible role in the frank starling mechanism of the heart edited by j karn
the a band part of titin a striated muscle specific protein spanning from the z line to the m line mainly consists of a well ordered super repeat array of immunoglobulin like and fibronectin type iii fn  like domains since it has been suspected that the fn domains might represent titin  s binding sites to myosin we have developed structural models for all of titin  s   fn like domains a subset of eight experimentally determined fn structures from a range of proteins including titin itself was used as homology templates after grouping the models according to their position within the super repeat segment of the central a band titin region we analyzed the models with respect to side chain conservation this showed that conserved residues form an extensive surface pattern predominantly at one side of the domains whereas domains outside the central c zone super repeat region show generally less conserved surfaces since the conserved surface residues may function as protein binding sites we experimentally studied the binding properties of expressed multi domain fn fragments this revealed that fn fragments specifically bind to the sub fragment  of myosin we also measured the effect of fn fragments on the contractile properties of single cardiac myocytes at sub maximal ca  concentrations fn fragments significantly enhance active tension this effect is most pronounced at short sarcomere length and as a result the length dependence of ca  activation is reduced a model of how titin  s fn like domains may influence actomyosin interaction is proposed
