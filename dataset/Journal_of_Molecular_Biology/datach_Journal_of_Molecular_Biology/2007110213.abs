structure and mechanism of hpch a metal ion dependent class ii aldolase from the homoprotocatechuate degradation pathway of escherichia coli
microorganisms are adept at degrading chemically resistant aromatic compounds one of the longest and most well characterized aromatic catabolic pathways is the  hydroxyphenylacetic acid degradation pathway of escherichia coli the final step involves the conversion of  hydroxy  oxo heptane   dioate into pyruvate and succinic semialdehyde this reaction is catalyzed by  hydroxy  oxo heptane   dioate aldolase hpch  a member of the divalent metal ion dependent class ii aldolase enzymes that have great biosynthetic potential we have solved the crystal structure of hpch in the apo form and with magnesium and the substrate analogue oxamate bound to     and     respectively comparison with similar structures of the homologous  dehydro  deoxygalactarate aldolase coupled with site directed mutagenesis data implicate histidine  and arginine  as key catalytic residues
