an improved single chain fab platform for efficient display and recombinant expression
antibody phage display libraries combined with high throughput selections have recently demonstrated tremendous promise to create the next generation of renewable recombinant antibodies to study proteins and their many post translational modification states however many challenges still remain such as optimized antibody scaffolds recently a single chain fragment antigen binding fab  scfab format in which the carboxy terminus of the light chain is linked to the amino terminus of the heavy chain was described to potentially combine the high display levels of a single chain fragment variable with the high stability of purified fabs however this format required removal of the interchain disulfide bond to achieve modest display levels and subsequent bacterial expression resulted in high levels of aggregated scfab hindering further use of scfabs here we developed an improved scfab format that retains the interchain disulfide bond by increasing the linker length between the light and heavy chains to improve display and bacterial expression levels to   mg l furthermore rerouting of the scfab to the co translational signal recognition particle pathway combined with reengineering of the signal peptide sequence results in display levels  fold above the original scfab format and  fold above parent fab levels this optimized scfab scaffold can be easily reformatted in a single step for expression in a bacterial or mammalian host to produce stable tm of   c  predominantly monomeric  gt   antibodies at a high yield ultimately this new scfab format will advance high throughput antibody generation platforms to discover the next generation of research and therapeutic antibodies
