characterization of a novel cullin binding domain in hiv  vif
human immunodeficiency virus tyoe  hiv  vif counteracts host restriction cytidine deaminase apobec g a g by co opting the cellular ubiquitin proteasome machinery vif utilizes a viral specific bc box to recruit elonginb elonginc and a novel zinc binding hcch motif to recruit cullin  cul  to form an e ubiquitin ligase targeting a g for polyubiquitination and subsequently proteasomal degradation to determine the structural requirements in hiv  vif hcch motif for cul binding and vif function we investigated the arrangement of the his and cys residues the role of the spacing between them and the requirement for the conserved residues our data demonstrate that exchanging cys for his and vice versa in the highly conserved zn coordinating hcch motif disrupted vif function and interaction with cul  moreover the maintenance of both conserved residues and spacing within the hcch motif is critical for vif function we have identified a  viral cul box  with consensus hx yfxcfx  x a x  cx h that is required for cul selection and subsequent a g degradation this novel motif may represent a potential new target for anti viral drug development
