physicochemical determinants of chaperone requirements
we describe a series of stringent relationships between abundance solubility and chaperone usage of proteins based on these relationships we show that the need of escherichia coli proteins for the chaperonin groel can be predicted with   accuracy furthermore from the observation that the abundance and solubility of proteins depend on the physicochemical properties of their amino acid sequences we demonstrate that the requirement for groel can also be predicted directly from the sequences with   accuracy these results indicate that the physicochemical properties of the amino acid sequences represent an essential component of the cellular quality control system that ensures the maintenance of protein homeostasis in living systems
