solution structure of the pdz domain from cytosolic human phosphatase hptp e complexed with a peptide reveals contribution of the      loop to pdz domain  ligand interactions
the solution structure of the second pdz domain from human phosphatase hptp e in complex with a c terminal peptide from the guanine nucleotide exchange factor ra gef  has been determined using d and d heteronuclear nmr experiments compared to previously solved structures the hptp e complex shows an enlarged interaction surface with the c terminus of the bound peptide novel contacts were found between the long structured     loop of the pdz domain and the sixth amino acid residue from the c terminus of the peptide this work underlines the importance of the     loop for ligand selection by pdz domains
