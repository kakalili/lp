crystal structure of a heat and protease stable part of the bacteriophage t short tail fibre edited by d rees
adsorption of t bacteriophage to the escherichia coli host cell is mediated by six long and six short tail fibres after at least three long tail fibres have bound short tail fibres extend and bind irreversibly to the core region of the host cell lipopolysaccharide lps  serving as inextensible stays during penetration of the cell envelope by the tail tube the short tail fibres consist of a parallel in register trimer of gene product   gp   the    crystal structure of a heat and protease stable fragment of gp  reveals three new folds a central right handed triple  helix a globular c terminal domain containing a  sandwich and an n terminal  structure reminiscent of but different from the adenovirus triple  spiral the centre of the c terminal domain shows weak homology to gp  a trimeric protein connecting the short fibre to the base plate suggesting that the trimerisation motifs of gp  and gp  are similar repeating sequence motifs suggest that the n terminal  structure extends further towards the n terminus and is conserved in the long tail fibre proteins gp  and gp
