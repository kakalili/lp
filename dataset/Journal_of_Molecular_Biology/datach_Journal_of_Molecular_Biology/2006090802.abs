variable dimerization of the ly a natural killer cell receptor results in differential engagement of its mhc class i ligand
natural killer nk cells play a vital role in the detection and elimination of virally infected and tumor cells the ly  family of nk receptors regulates nk cell function by sensing major histocompatibility complex mhc class i molecules on target cells previous crystal studies revealed that the ly a homodimer binds one mhc molecule in an asymmetric interaction whereas the ly c homodimer binds two mhc in a symmetrical fashion moreover the bound receptors adopt distinctly different homodimeric forms a  closed state  for ly a and an  open state  for ly c steric clashes between mhc molecules would preclude the closed ly a dimer from engaging two mhc in the manner of the open ly c dimer to determine whether individual ly  receptors can undergo a conformational switch enabling them to bind mhc in different ways we carried out a solution nmr study of unbound ly a aided by dipolar coupling technology this study reveals that in solution unligated ly a adopts a symmetric open state homodimer conformation similar to that seen previously for ly c hence ly a can assume both closed and open states to address whether the ly a dimer can bind two mhc molecules in solution besides the binding of one mhc observed in the crystal we carried out analytical ultracentrifugation experiments velocity sedimentation demonstrates that the ly a dimer can engage two mhc molecules in solution in agreement with nmr results showing that unbound ly a exists predominantly in the open state
