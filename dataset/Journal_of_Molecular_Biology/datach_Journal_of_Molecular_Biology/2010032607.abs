a new scaffold of an old protein fold ensures binding to the bisintercalator thiocoraline
thiocoraline is a thiodepsipeptide with potent antitumor activity tiox a protein with an unidentified function is encoded by a gene of the thiocoraline biosynthetic gene cluster the crystal structure of the full length tiox protein at     resolution reveals that tiox protomer shares an ancient      fold motif with glyoxalase i and bleomycin resistance protein families despite a very low sequence homology intriguingly four tiox monomers form a unique  fold symmetric tetrameric assembly that is stabilized by four intermolecular disulfide bonds formed cyclically between cys  and cys  of adjacent monomers the arrangement of two of the four monomers in the tiox tetramer is analogous to that in dimeric bleomycin resistance proteins this analogy indicates that this novel higher order structural scaffold of tiox may have evolved to bind thiocoraline our equilibrium titration studies demonstrate the binding of a thiocoraline chromophore analog quinaldic acid to tiox thereby substantiating this model furthermore a strain of streptomyces albus containing an exogenous thiocoraline gene cluster devoid of functional tiox maintains thiocoraline production albeit with a lower yield taken together these observations rule out a direct enzymatic function of tiox and suggest that tiox is involved in thiocoraline resistance or secretion
