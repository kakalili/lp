epistasis among deleterious mutations in the hiv  protease
a central goal in molecular evolution is to understand how genetic interactions between protein mutations shape protein function and fitness while intergenic epistasis has been extensively explored in eukaryotes bacteria and viruses intragenic epistatic interactions have been insufficiently studied here we employ a model system in which lambda phage fitness correlates with the enzymatic activity of human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  protease to systematically determine the epistatic interactions between intragenic pairs of deleterious protein substitutions we generated   genotypes of the hiv  protease each carrying pairs of nucleotide substitution mutations whose separated and combined deleterious effects on fitness were then determined a high proportion    of pairs displayed lethality several pairs exhibited significant interactions for fitness including positive and negative epistasis significant negative epistatic interactions predominated    over positive interactions    however the average sd epistatic effect           was not significantly different from zero p     notably epistatic interactions regardless of epistatic direction tend to be more frequent in the context of less deleterious mutations in the present study the high frequencies of lethality and negative epistasis indicate that the hiv  protease is highly sensitive to the effects of deleterious mutations therefore proteins may not be as robust to mutational change as is usually expected
