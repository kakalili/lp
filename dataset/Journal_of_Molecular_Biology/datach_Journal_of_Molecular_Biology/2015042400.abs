allosteric coupling via distant disorder to order transitions
intrinsic disorder provides a means of maximizing allosteric coupling in proteins however the mechanisms by which the disorder functions in allostery remain to be elucidated small ligand bio   amp binding and dimerization of the escherichia coli biotin repressor are allosterically coupled folding of a disordered loop in the allosteric effector binding site is required to realize the full coupling free energy of      kcal mol observed in the wild type protein alanine substitution of a glycine residue on the dimerization surface that does not directly contribute to the dimerization interface completely abolishes this coupling in this work the structure of this variant solved by x ray crystallography reveals a monomeric corepressor bound protein in the structure loops neither of which contains the alanine substitution on both the dimerization and effector binding surfaces that are folded in the corepressor bound wild type protein are disordered the structural data combined with functional measurements indicate that allosteric coupling between ligand binding and dimerization in bira e coli biotin repressor biotin protein ligase is achieved via reciprocal communication of disorder to order transitions on two distant functional surfaces
