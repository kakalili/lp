the refined structure of a protein catenane the hk  bacteriophage capsid at    resolution
the hk  bacteriophage capsid is a unique example of macromolecular catenanes interlocked rings of covalently attached protein subunits the chain mail organization of the subunits stabilizes a particle in which the maximum thickness of the protein shell is   and the maximum diameter is    the electron density has the appearance of a balloon illustrating the extraordinary strength conferred by the unique subunit organization the refined structure shows novel qualities of the hk  shell protein gp that together with the protease gp  guides the assembly and maturation of the virion although gp forms hexamers and pentamers and the subunits exist in different structural environments the tertiary structures of the seven protein molecules in the viral asymmetric unit are closely similar the interactions of the subunits in the shell are exceptionally complex with each subunit interacting with nine other subunits the interactions of the n terminus released after gp cleavage appear important for organization of the loops that become crosslinked to the core of a neighboring subunit at the maturation a comparison with a model of the prohead ii structure revealed that the surfaces of non covalent contact between the monomers that build up hexamers pentamers are completely redefined during maturation
