engineering synthetic antibody inhibitors specific for ld or ld motifs of paxillin
focal adhesion protein paxillin links integrin and growth factor signaling to actin cytoskeleton most of paxillin signaling activity is regulated via leucine rich ld motifs ld  ld  located at the n terminus here we demonstrate a method to engineer highly selective synthetic antibodies sabs against ld and ld that are binding sites for focal adhesion kinase fak and other proteins phage display selections against peptides were used to generate sabs recognizing each ld motif in the obtained x ray crystal structures of the ld sab complexes the ld motifs are helical and bind sabs through a hydrophobic side similarly as in the structures with natural paxillin partners the sabs are capable of pulling down endogenous paxillin in complex with fak and can visualize paxillin in focal adhesions in cells they were also used as selective inhibitors to effectively compete with focal adhesion targeting domain of fak for the binding to ld and ld  the sabs are tools for investigation of paxillin ld binding  platforms  and are capable of inhibiting paxillin interactions thereby useful as potential therapeutics in the future
