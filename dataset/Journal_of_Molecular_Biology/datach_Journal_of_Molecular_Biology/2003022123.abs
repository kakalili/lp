crystal structure of activated mode reveals conformational changes involving both oxyanion and dna binding domains
mode is a bacterial transcriptional regulator that orchestrates many aspects of molybdenum metabolism by binding to specific dna sequences in a molybdate dependent fashion we present the crystal structure of escherichia coli mode in complex with molybdate which was determined at    from a merohedrally twinned crystal twin fraction     with space group p  we now have structures of mode in both its  switched on   ligand bound and  switched off   apo states comparison with the apo structure shows that ligand binding leads to extensive conformational changes not only in the molybdate binding domain but also in the dna binding domain the most obvious difference is the loss of the pronounced asymmetry between the two chains of the mode dimer which had been a characteristic property of the apo structure another major change concerns the relative orientation of the two dna interacting winged helix turn helix motifs manual docking of an idealized dna structure suggests that this conformational change should improve dna binding of the activated molybdate bound mode
