arsenic induced activation of the homeodomain interacting protein kinase  hipk  to camp response element binding protein creb axis
cyclic amp response element binding protein creb plays key transcriptional roles in cell metabolism proliferation and survival ser  phosphorylation by protein kinase a pka is a well characterized creb activation mechanism homeodomain interacting protein kinase hipk   a nuclear serine threonine kinase activates creb through ser  phosphorylation however the regulatory mechanism remains uncharacterized transfection of creb in hek  cells together with the kinase demonstrated that hipk phosphorylated creb at ser  but not ser   likewise pka phosphorylated creb at ser  but not ser   suggesting two distinct creb regulatory mechanisms by hipk and pka in vitro kinase assay revealed that hipk  and hipk and hipk  directly phosphorylated creb cells exposed to   m sodium arsenite increased the stability of hipk and hipk proteins leading to creb activation via ser  phosphorylation phospho ser  creb showed facilitated interaction with the tfiid subunit coactivator taf assessed by immunoprecipitation furthermore a focused gene array between cells transfected with creb alone and creb plus hipk over empty vector transfected control displayed   and  fold upregulation of cyclin a  respectively while no upregulation was displayed by hipk alone these results suggest that the hipk phospho ser  creb axis is a new arsenic responsive creb activation mechanism in parallel with the pka phospho ser  creb axis
