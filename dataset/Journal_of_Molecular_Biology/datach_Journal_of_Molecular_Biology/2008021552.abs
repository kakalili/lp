hierarchical binding of the todt response regulator to its multiple recognition sites at the tod pathway operon promoter
the tods and todt proteins form a highly specific two component regulatory system that controls the expression of genes involved in the degradation of toluene benzene and ethylbenzene via the toluene dioxygenase pathway the catabolic genes of the toluene dioxygenase pathway are transcribed from a single promoter called ptodx once the response regulator todt is phosphorylated by the tods sensor kinase in response to pathway substrates we show here that todt is a monomer in solution and that it binds to three specific sites in the ptodx promoter centered at        and    with respect to the transcription start site the    and    sites are pseudopalindromic whereas the    site is half a palindrome todt binding to its target sites is sequential as shown by electrophoresis mobility gel shift assays and footprinting the binding affinity values of todt as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry are          and       m for the        and    sites respectively and the binding stoichiometry is one monomer per half palindromic element mutational analysis revealed that all three sites contribute to ptodx strength although the most relevant site is the distal one with respect to the    extended element of the downstream promoter element the c todt c terminal todt fragment amino acids       a truncated variant of todt that contains the c terminal half of the protein bearing the dna binding domain binds in vitro to all three sites with affinity similar to that of the full length protein however c todt in contrast to the full length regulator does not activate in vitro transcription from ptodx we discuss the consequences of the organization of the binding sites on transcriptional control and propose that the n terminal domain of todt is necessary for appropriate interactions with other transcriptional elements
