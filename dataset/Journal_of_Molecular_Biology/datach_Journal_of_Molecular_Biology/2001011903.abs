titin and the sarcomere symmetry paradox edited by j karn
titin is thought to play a major role in myofibril assembly elasticity and stability a single molecule spans half the sarcomere and makes interactions with both a thick filament and the z line in the unit cell structure of each half sarcomere there is one thick filament with  fold symmetry and two thin filaments with approximately  fold symmetry the minimum number of titin molecules that could satisfy both these symmetries is   we determined the actual number of titin molecules in a unit cell from scanning transmission electron microscopy mass measurements of end filaments one of these emerges from each tip of the thick filament and is thought to be the in register aggregate of the titin molecules associated with the filament the mass per unit length of the end filament    kda nm is consistent with six titin molecules not   thus the number of titin molecules present is insufficient to satisfy both symmetries we suggest a novel solution to this paradox in which four of the six titin molecules interact with the two thin filaments in the unit cell while the remaining two interact with the two thin filaments that enter the unit cell from the adjacent sarcomere this arrangement would augment mechanical stability in the sarcomere
