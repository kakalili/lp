two repeat tetrahymena telomeric d tggggttggggt sequence interconverts between asymmetric dimeric g quadruplexes in solution
recently the two repeat human telomeric d tagggttagggt sequence has been shown to form interconverting parallel and antiparallel g quadruplex structures in solution here we examine the structures formed by the two repeat tetrahymena telomeric d tggggttggggt sequence which differs from the human sequence only by one g for a replacement in each repeat we show by nmr that this sequence forms two novel g quadruplex structures in na containing solution both structures are asymmetric dimeric g quadruplexes involving a core of four stacked g tetrads and two edgewise loops the adjacent strands of the g tetrad core are alternately parallel and antiparallel all g tetrads adopt syn syn anti anti alignments which occur with   syn anti syn anti   alternations along g tracks in the first structure head to head  two loops are at one end of the g tetrad core in the second structure head to tail  two loops are located on opposite ends of the g tetrad core in contrast to the human telomere counterpart the proportions of the two forms here are similar for a wide range of temperatures their unfolding rates are also similar with an activation enthalpy of   kj mol
