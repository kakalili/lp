a highly conserved interspecies vh in the human genome
idiotype conservation between human and mouse antibodies has been observed in association with various infectious and autoimmune diseases we have isolated a human anti idiotypic antibody to a mouse monoclonal anti ige antibody bsw  suggesting a conserved interspecies idiotype associated with an anti ige response to find the homologue of bsw  in the human genome we applied the guided selection strategy combining vh of bsw  with a human vl repertoire resulted in three light chains the three vl chains were then combined with a human vh repertoire resulting in three clones specific for human ige surprisingly one clone hu  had the same epitope specificity and functional in vitro activity as bsw  and vh complementarity determining regions identical with that of bsw  real time pcr analysis confirmed the presence of the hu  vh sequence in the human genome these data document the first example of the isolation of a human antibody where high sequence similarity to the original murine vh sequence is associated with common antigen and epitope specificity
