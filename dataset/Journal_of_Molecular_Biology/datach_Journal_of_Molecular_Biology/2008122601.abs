biochemical and structural studies of yeast vps oligomerization
the escrt endosomal sorting complexes required for transport pathway functions in vesicle formation at the multivesicular body the budding of enveloped rna viruses such as hiv  and the final abscission stage of cytokinesis as the only known enzyme in the escrt pathway the aaa atpase atpase associated with diverse cellular activities vps provides the energy required for multiple rounds of vesicle formation like other vps proteins yeast vps cycles through two states a catalytically inactive disassembled state that we show here is a dimer and a catalytically active higher order assembly that we have modeled as a dodecamer composed of two stacked hexameric rings we also report crystal structures of yeast vps proteins in the apo and atp s adenosine   o  thiotriphosphate  bound states in both cases vps subunits assembled into continuous helices with  fold screw axes that are analogous to helices seen previously in other vps crystal forms the helices are stabilized by extensive interactions between the large and small aaa atpase domains of adjacent vps subunits suggesting that these contact surfaces may be used to build both the catalytically active dodecamer and catalytically inactive dimer consistent with this model we have identified interface mutants that specifically inhibit vps dimerization dodecamerization or both thus the vps dimer and dodecamer likely form distinct but overlapping interfaces finally our structural studies have allowed us to model the conformation of a conserved loop pore loop  that is predicted to form an arginine rich pore at the center of one of the vps hexameric rings our mutational analyses demonstrate that pore loop  residues arg  and arg  are required for efficient hiv  budding thereby supporting a role for this  arginine collar  in vps function
