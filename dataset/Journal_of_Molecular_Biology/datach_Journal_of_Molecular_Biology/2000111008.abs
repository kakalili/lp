x ray structures of five renin inhibitors bound to saccharopepsin exploration of active site specificity edited by r huber
saccharopepsin is a vacuolar aspartic proteinase involved in activation of a number of hydrolases the enzyme has great structural homology to mammalian aspartic proteinases including human renin and we have used it as a model system to study the binding of renin inhibitors by x ray crystallography five medium to high resolution structures of saccharopepsin complexed with transition state analogue renin inhibitors were determined the structure of a cyclic peptide inhibitor pd     complexed with the proteinase was solved to    resolution this inhibitor has low affinity for human renin yet binds very tightly to the yeast proteinase ki  nm  the high affinity of this inhibitor can be attributed to its bulky cyclic moiety spanning p p   and other residues that appear to optimally fit the binding sub sites of the enzyme superposition of the saccharopepsin structure on that of renin showed that a movement of the loop      relative to renin facilitates tighter binding of this inhibitor to saccharopepsin our    resolution structure of the complex with cp     shows that its benzimidazole p replacement retains one of the standard hydrogen bonds that normally involve the inhibitor  s main chain this suggests a non peptide lead in overcoming the problem of susceptible peptide bonds in the design of aspartic proteinase inhibitors cp    which possesses a basic histidine residue at p  has a high affinity for renin ki  nm but proves to be a poor inhibitor for saccharopepsin ki    m  this may stem from the fact that the histidine residue would not bind favourably with the predominantly hydrophobic s sub site of saccharopepsin
