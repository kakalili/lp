selectivity of cdc  homology domain containing guanine nucleotide exchange factors
the ras family of small g proteins plays an essential role in the regulation of a variety of signal transduction processes ranging from cell cycle control to the regulation of exocytosis signalling by the ras g proteins is initiated by the cdc  homology domain cdc  hd containing guanine nucleotide exchange factors gefs  each gef with its specific selectivity profile towards g proteins commonly acts on only a small subset of the ras family members thus gefs play a pivotal part in establishing the activation of the downstream signalling routes the structural basis for the establishment of selectivity in the gef  g protein interaction is only partially understood and several controversies on the selectivity of gefs are discussed in the literature in the present study we undertook a systematic approach to determine the selectivity of cdc  hd for members of the ras family we generated a data set of   pairs using a standardised in vitro approach encompassing purified recombinant proteins and a comprehensive mutational study analysed the basis of the selectivity together these data highlight the distinct selectivity of various gefs and allow for predictions of untested combinations of gefs and g proteins
