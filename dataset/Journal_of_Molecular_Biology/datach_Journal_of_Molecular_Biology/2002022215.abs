chiral mutagenesis of insulin  s hidden receptor binding surface structure of an allo isoleucinea analogue edited by p e wright
the hydrophobic core of vertebrate insulins contains an invariant isoleucine residue at position a  lack of variation may reflect this side chain  s dual contribution to structure and function ilea is proposed both to stabilize the a a   helix and to contribute to a  hidden  functional surface exposed on receptor binding substitution of ilea by alanine results in segmental unfolding of the a a   helix lower thermodynamic stability and impaired receptor binding such a spectrum of perturbations although of biophysical interest confounds interpretation of structure activity relationships to investigate the specific contribution of ilea to insulin  s functional surface we have employed non standard mutagenesis inversion of side chain chirality in engineered monomer allo ilea dkp insulin although the analogue retains native structure and stability its affinity for the insulin receptor is impaired by  fold thus whereas insulin  s core readily accommodates allo isoleucine at a  its activity is exquisitely sensitive to chiral inversion we propose that the ilea side chain inserts within a chiral pocket of the receptor as part of insulin  s hidden functional surface
