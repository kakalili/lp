efficient recovery of high affinity antibodies from a single chain fab yeast display library
yeast display is a powerful technology for the isolation of monoclonal antibodies mabs against a target antigen antibody libraries have been displayed on the surface of yeast as both single chain variable fragment scfv and antigen binding fragment fab  here we combine these two formats to display well characterized mabs as single chain fabs scfabs on the surface of yeast and construct the first scfab yeast display antibody library when expressed on the surface of yeast two out of three anti human immunodeficiency virus hiv  mabs bound with higher affinity as scfabs than scfvs also the soluble scfab preparations exhibited binding and neutralization profiles comparable to that of the corresponding fab fragments display of an immune hiv  scfab library on the surface of yeast followed by rounds of sorting against hiv  gp   allowed for the selection of  antigen specific clones when the same cdna was used to construct the library in an scfv format a similar number but a lower affinity set of clones were selected based on these results yeast displayed scfab libraries can be constructed and selected with high efficiency characterized without the need for a reformatting step and used to isolate higher affinity antibodies than scfv libraries
