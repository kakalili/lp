rasins genetically encoded intrabodies of activated ras proteins
k and h ras are the most commonly mutated genes in human tumors and are critical for conferring and maintaining the oncogenic phenotype in tumors with poor prognoses here we design genetically encoded antibody like ligands intrabodies that recognize active gtp bound k and h ras these ligands which use the  th domain of human fibronectin as their scaffold are stable inside the cells and when fused with a fluorescent protein label the constitutively active g v mutant h ras primary selection of ligands against ras with mrna display resulted in an intrabody termed rasin  that binds with a kd of   m to h ras g v  gtp  excellent state selectivity and remarkable specificity for k and h ras rasin recognizes residues in the switch i region of ras similar to raf rbd and competes with raf rbd for binding an affinity maturation selection based on rasin resulted in rasin  which binds with a kd of  nm and also retains excellent state selectivity both of these intrabodies colocalize with h ras k ras and g v mutants inside the cells providing new potential tools to monitor and modulate ras mediated signaling finally rasin and rasin both display selectivity for the g v mutants as compared with wild type ras providing a potential route for mutant selective recognition of ras
