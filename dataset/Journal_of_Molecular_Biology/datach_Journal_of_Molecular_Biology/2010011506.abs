molecular basis for the recognition and cleavages of igf ii tgf   and amylin by human insulin degrading enzyme
insulin degrading enzyme ide is involved in the clearance of many bioactive peptide substrates including insulin and amyloid   peptides vital to the development of diabetes and alzheimer s disease respectively ide can also rapidly degrade hormones that are held together by intramolecular disulfide bond s without their reduction furthermore ide exhibits a remarkable ability to preferentially degrade structurally similar peptides such as the selective degradation of insulin like growth factor igf ii and transforming growth factor   tgf   over igf i and epidermal growth factor respectively here we used high accuracy mass spectrometry to identify the cleavage sites of human igf ii tgf   amylin reduced amylin and amyloid  by human ide we also determined the structures of human ide  igf ii and ide  tgf  at     and ide  amylin at     we found that ide cleaves its substrates at multiple sites in a biased stochastic manner furthermore the presence of a disulfide bond in amylin allows ide to cut at an additional site in the middle of the peptide amino acids      our amylin bound ide structure offers insight into how the structural constraint from a disulfide bond in amylin can alter ide cleavage sites together with nmr structures of amylin and the igf and epidermal growth factor families our work also reveals the structural basis of how the high dipole moment of substrates complements the charge distribution of the ide catalytic chamber for the substrate selectivity in addition we show how the ability of substrates to properly anchor their n terminus to the exosite of ide and undergo a conformational switch upon binding to the catalytic chamber of ide can also contribute to the selective degradation of structurally related growth factors
