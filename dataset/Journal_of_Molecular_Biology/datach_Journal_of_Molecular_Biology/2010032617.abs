reversible unfolding of a thermophilic membrane protein in phospholipid detergent mixed micelles
folding mechanisms and stability of membrane proteins are poorly understood because of the known difficulties in finding experimental conditions under which reversible denaturation could be possible in this work we describe the equilibrium unfolding of archaeoglobus fulgidus copa an   residue  helical membrane protein that is involved in transporting cu throughout biological membranes the incubation of copa reconstituted in phospholipid detergent mixed micelles with high concentrations of guanidinium hydrochloride induced a reversible decrease in fluorescence quantum yield far uv ellipticity and loss of atpase and phosphatase activities refolding of copa from this unfolded state led to recovery of full biological activity and all the structural features of the native enzyme copa unfolding showed typical characteristics of a two state process with  gw     kj mol   m   kj mol   m   cm  m and  cpw     kj mol   k   these results point out to a fine tuning mechanism for improving protein stability circular dichroism spectroscopic analysis of the unfolded state shows that most of the secondary and tertiary structures were disrupted the fraction of trp fluorescence accessible to soluble quenchers shifted from   in the native state to   in the unfolded state with a significant spectral redshift also hydrophobic patches in copa mainly located in the transmembrane region were disrupted as indicated by  anilino naphtalene  sulfonate fluorescence nevertheless the unfolded state had a small but detectable amount of residual structure which might play a key role in both copa folding and adaptation for working at high temperatures
