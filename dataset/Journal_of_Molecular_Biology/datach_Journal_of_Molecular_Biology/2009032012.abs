conserved element of the dicistrovirus igr ires that mimics an e site trna ribosome interaction mediates multiple functions
the internal ribosome entry site within the intergenic region igr ires of the dicistroviridae family mimics a trna to directly assemble  s ribosomes and initiate translation at a non aug codon from the ribosomal a site a comparison of igr iress within this viral family reveals structural similarity but little sequence similarity however a few specific conserved elements exist which likely have important roles in ires function in this study we have generated a battery of mutations to characterize the role of a conserved loop l   region of the igr ires mutating specific nucleotides within the l  region inhibited igr ires mediated translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates by assaying different steps in ires function we found that the mutant l  iress had reduced affinity for  s ribosomes but not  s subunits indicating that the l  region mediated either binding to preformed  s or  s joining furthermore mutations in l  altered the position of the ribosome on the mutant ires indicating that the trna like anticodon codon mimic within the ribosomal p site is disrupted structural studies have revealed that the l  region interacts with the l stalk of the  s subunit which is similar to the interactions between the t loop of the e site trna and ribosomal protein rpl  our results demonstrate that the conserved l  region directs multiple steps in igr ires mediated translation including ribosome binding and positioning which are functions that the e site trna may normally mediate during translation
