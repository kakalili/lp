diverse caenorhabditis elegans genes that are upregulated in dauer larvae also show elevated transcript levels in long lived aged or starved adults aaedited by m yaniv
under adverse conditions the nematode caenorhabditis elegans undergoes reversible developmental arrest as dauer larvae an alternative third larval stage adapted for dispersal and long term survival following such arrest which may exceed three times their usual life span worms resume development to form reproductive adults of normal subsequent longevity mutations of genes in the dauer formation daf pathway can extend life span two to fourfold even in adults that mature without diapause to identify transcript level changes that might contribute to extended survival we prepared a subtractive cdna library of messages more abundant in dauer than in non dauer l  larvae six genes were confirmed as three to ninefold upregulated in dauer larvae after correction for mrna load genes encoding poly a binding protein pabp  heat shock proteins hsp  and hsp  and three novel genes of uncertain function the novel genes encode a partial homologue of human activating signal cointegrator  asc   a gtp binding homologue of a ribosomal protein and an sh domain protein transcript levels for all except hsp  increased during aging in two c elegans strains whereas the three novel genes and possibly pabp were also induced to varying degrees by starvation of adults all six genes are expressed at higher levels in young adults of long lived daf mutant strains than in normal longevity controls suggesting that increased expression of these genes may play a protective function thus favoring survival in diverse contexts
