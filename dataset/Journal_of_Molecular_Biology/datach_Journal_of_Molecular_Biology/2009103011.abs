darpins as bispecific receptor antagonists analyzed for immunoglobulin e receptor blockage
the concept of multispecific antibodies is of high therapeutic interest but has failed to produce pharmaceutical products due to the poor biophysical properties of such molecules here we propose an alternative and simple way to generate bispecific binding molecules using designed ankyrin repeat proteins darpins  for this purpose monovalent darpins with different epitope specificities were selected against the  chain of the high affinity receptor for human immunoglobulin e ige  fc ri   two of the isolated binders interfering with ige binding to the receptor were joined to each other or to themselves via a flexible protein linker the resulting bivalent and bispecific darpins were tested for their ability to prevent allergen induced cell degranulation using rat basophilic leukemia cells stably transfected with human fc ri  the bispecific darpin construct was the most potent one efficiently blocking the ige  fc ri interaction and preventing the release of proinflammatory mediators noteworthy the multivalent and multispecific darpin construct did not show any alteration of the beneficial biophysical properties of the monovalent parental darpins hence bispecific darpins may be used to generate receptor antagonists simultaneously targeting different epitopes on the same molecule moreover they easily overcome the limiting immunoglobulin binding paradigm one binding molecule one epitope and thereby represent an alternative to monoclonal antibodies in cases where the immunoglobulin scaffold is unsuitable
