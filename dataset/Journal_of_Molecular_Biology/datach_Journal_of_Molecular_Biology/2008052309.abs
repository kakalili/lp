ring opening mechanism revealed by crystal structures of nagb and its es intermediate complex
glucosamine  phosphate deaminase nagb catalyzes the conversion of d glucosamine  phosphate glcn p to d fructose  phosphate and ammonia this reaction is the final step of n acetylglucosamine utilization and decides its metabolic fate the enzyme from streptococcus mutans belongs to the monomeric subfamily of nagb the crystal structure of the native smunagb nagb from s mutans presented here compared with the structures of its homologs bsunagb nagb from bacillus subtilis and econagb nagb from e coli  implies a conformational change of the  lid  motif in the activation of the monomeric nagb enzyme we have also captured the enzyme  substrate intermediate complex of the nagb family at low ph where a remarkable loss of the catalytic activity of smunagb was detected the enzyme  substrate intermediate presents the initial step of the glcn p deaminase reaction the structural evidence   supports the  anomer of glcn p as the specific natural substrate of nagb   displays the substrate binding pocket at the active site and   together with the site directed mutagenesis studies demonstrates the ring opening mechanism of an asn his glu triad that performs the proton transfer from o to o to open the sugar ring
