immunogenic display of diverse peptides on virus like particles of rna phage ms
the high level of immunogenicity of peptides displayed in dense repetitive arrays on virus like particles makes recombinant vlps promising vaccine carriers here we describe a platform for vaccine development based on the vlps of rna bacteriophage ms  it serves for the engineered display of specific peptide sequences but will also allow the construction of random peptide libraries from which specific binding activities can be recovered by affinity selection peptides representing the v loop of hiv gp  and the ecl loop of the hiv coreceptor ccr  were inserted into a surface loop of ms coat protein both insertions disrupted coat vlp assembly apparently by interfering with protein folding but these defects were suppressed efficiently by genetically fusing coat protein s two identical polypeptides into a single chain dimer the resulting vlps displayed the v and ecl peptides on their surfaces where they showed the potent immunogenicity that is the hallmark of vlp displayed antigens experiments with random sequence peptide libraries show the single chain dimer to be highly tolerant of six eight and ten amino acid insertions ms vlps support the display of a wide diversity of peptides in a highly immunogenic format and they encapsidate the mrnas that direct their synthesis thus establishing the genotype phenotype linkage necessary for recovery of affinity selected sequences the single chain ms vlp therefore unites in a single structural platform the selective power of phage display with the high immunogenicity of vlps
