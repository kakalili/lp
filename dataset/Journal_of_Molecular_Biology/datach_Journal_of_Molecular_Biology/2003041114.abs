sequence dependence of substrate recognition and cleavage by yeast rnase iii
yeast rnt p is a member of the double stranded rna dsrna specific rnase iii family of endoribonucleases involved in rna processing and rna interference rnai  unlike other rnase iii enzymes which recognize a variety of rna duplexes rnt p cleaves specifically rna stems capped with the conserved agnn tetraloop this unusual substrate specificity challenges the established dogma for substrate selection by rnase iii and questions the dsrna contribution to recognition by rnt p here we show that the dsrna sequence adjacent to the tetraloop regulates rnt p cleavage by interfering with rna binding in context sequences surrounding the cleavage site directly influence the cleavage efficiency introduction of sequences that stabilize the rna helix enhanced binding while reducing the turnover rate indicating that unlike the tetraloop rnt p binding to the dsrna helix may become rate limiting these results suggest that rnt p activity is strictly regulated by a combination of primary and tertiary structural elements allowing a substrate specific binding and cleavage efficiency
