tfb or tfb is sufficient for thermococcus kodakaraensis viability and for basal transcription in vitro
archaeal rna polymerases rnaps are most similar to eukaryotic rnap ii pol ii but require the support of only two archaeal general transcription factors tbp tata box binding protein and tfb archaeal homologue of the eukaryotic general transcription factor tfiib to initiate basal transcription however many archaeal genomes encode more than one tfb and or tbp leading to the hypothesis that different tfb tbp combinations may be employed to direct initiation from different promoters in archaea as a first test of this hypothesis we have determined the ability of rnap purified from thermococcus kodakaraensis t k  to initiate transcription from a variety of t k promoters in vitro when provided with t k tbp and either tfb or tfb  the two tfbs encoded in the t k genome with every promoter active in vitro transcription initiation occurred with either tfb or tfb although the optimum salt concentration for initiation was generally higher for tfb      mm k  than for tfb      mm k  consistent with this functional redundancy in vitro t k strains have been constructed with the tfb  tfb  tk   or tfb  tfb  tk   encoding gene deleted these mutants exhibit no detectable growth defects under laboratory conditions domain swapping between tfb and tfb has identified a central region that contributes to the salt sensitivity of tfb activity and deleting residues predicted to form the tip of the b finger region of tfb had no detectable effects on promoter recognition or transcription initiation but did eliminate the production of very short    nt abortive transcripts
