crystal structure of polymerization competent actin
all actin crystal structures reported to date represent actin complexed or chemically modified with molecules that prevent its polymerization actin cleaved with ecp  protease at a single site between gly  and val  is virtually non polymerizable in the ca atp bound form but remains polymerization competent in the mg bound form here a crystal structure of the true uncomplexed ecp  cleaved actin ecp actin solved to     resolution is reported in contrast to the much more open conformation of the ecp actin s nucleotide binding cleft in solution the crystal structure of uncomplexed ecp actin contains actin in a typical closed conformation similar to the complexed actin structures this unambiguously demonstrates that the overall structure of monomeric actin is not significantly affected by a multitude of actin binding proteins and toxins the invariance of actin crystal structures suggests that the salt and precipitants necessary for crystallization stabilize actin in only one of its possible conformations the asymmetric unit cell contains a new type of antiparallel actin dimer that may correspond to the  lower dimer  implicated in f actin nucleation and branching in addition symmetry related actin actin contacts form a head to tail dimer that is strikingly similar to the longitudinal dimer predicted by the holmes f actin model including a rotation of the monomers relative to each other not observed previously in actin crystal structures
