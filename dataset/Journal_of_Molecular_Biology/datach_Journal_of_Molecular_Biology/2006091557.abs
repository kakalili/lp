human kinetochore associated kinesin cenp e visualized at    resolution bound to microtubules
the highly dynamic process of cell division is effected in part by molecular motors that generate the forces necessary for its enactment several members of the kinesin superfamily of motor proteins are implicated in mitosis such as cenp e which plays essential roles in cell division including association with the kinetochore to stabilize attachment of chromosomes to microtubules prior to and during their separation neither the functional assembly state of cenp e nor its direction of motion along the polar microtubule are certain to determine the mode of interaction between cenp e and microtubules we have used cryo electron microscopy to visualize cenp e motor domains complexed with microtubules and calculated a density map of the complex to    resolution by combining helical and single particle reconstruction methods the interface between the motor domain and microtubules was modeled by docking atomic resolution models of the subunits into the cryoem density map our results support a plus end motion for cenp e consistent with features of the crystallographic structure despite considerable functional differences from the monomeric transporter kinesin kif a and the oppositely directed ncd kinesin cenp e appears to share many features of the intermolecular interactions suggesting that differences in motor function are governed by small variations in the loops at the microtubule interface
