identification of the ledgf p  binding site in hiv  integrase
lens epithelium derived growth factor ledgf p  is an important cellular co factor for human immunodeficiency virus hiv replication we originally identified ledgf p  as a binding partner of integrase in in human cells the interaction has been mapped to the integrase binding domain ibd of ledgf p  located in the c terminal part we have subsequently shown that in carrying the q  a mutation remains enzymatically active but is impaired for interaction with ledgf p  to map the integrase ledgf interface in more detail we have now identified and characterized two regions within the enzyme involved in the interaction with ledgf p  the first region centers around residues w  and w  while the second extends from i  up to e   for the different in mutants the interaction with ledgf p  and the enzymatic activities were determined in w  a  in i  a  in r  a  in q  a and in e  a are impaired for interaction with ledgf p  but retain   processing and strand transfer activities due to impaired integration an hiv  strain containing the w  a mutation in in displays reduced replication capacity whereas virus carrying in q  a is replication defective comparison of the wild type in ledgf p  co crystal structure with that of the modelled structure of the in q  a and in w  a mutant integrases corroborated our experimental data
