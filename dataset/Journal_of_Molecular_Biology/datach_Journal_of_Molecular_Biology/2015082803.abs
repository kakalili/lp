structures of degq from legionella pneumophila define distinct on and off states
htra high temperature requirement a family proteins play important roles in protein quality control processes in the bacterial periplasm a common feature of all members of this family is their modular organization comprising a chymotrypsin like protease domain and at least one pdz postsynaptic density of  kda disks large homolog  and zonula occludens  domain all characterized htra proteins assemble into complex oligomers consisting of typically    monomers which allow a tight regulation of proteolytic activity here we provide evidence that the assembly of proteolytically active higher order complexes of degq from legionella pneumophila is triggered by the binding of substrate derived peptides crystal structures of inactive  mers and active  mers of degq reveal molecular details of elements of a conserved allosteric activation cascade that defines distinct protease on and off states results from degqlp variants harboring structure based amino acid substitutions indicate that peptide binding to the pdz domain is critical for proteolytic activity but not for the formation of higher order oligomers combining structural mutagenesis and biochemical data we show that in contrast to the proteolytic activity the chaperone function of degq is not affected by the state of the activation cascade
