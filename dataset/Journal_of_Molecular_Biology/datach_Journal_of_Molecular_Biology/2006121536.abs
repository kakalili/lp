mosaic structure of human coronavirus nl  one thousand years of evolution
before the sars outbreak only two human coronaviruses hcov were known hcov oc  and hcov  e with the discovery of sars cov in    a third family member was identified soon thereafter we described the fourth human coronavirus hcov nl   a virus that has spread worldwide and is associated with croup in children we report here the complete genome sequence of two hcov nl  clinical isolates designated amsterdam  and amsterdam   the genomes are    and    nucleotides long respectively and share the same genome organization we identified two variable regions one within the a and one within the s gene whereas the b and n genes were most conserved phylogenetic analysis revealed that hcov nl  genomes have a mosaic structure with multiple recombination sites additionally employing three different algorithms we assessed the evolutionary rate for the s gene of group ib coronaviruses to be       substitutions per site per year using this evolutionary rate we determined that hcov nl  diverged in the  th century from its closest relative hcov  e
