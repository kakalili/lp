solution structure domain features and structural implications of mutants of the chromo domain from the fission yeast histone methyltransferase clr  edited by p e wright
the encapsulation of otherwise transcribable loci within transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin is rapidly gaining recognition as an important mechanism of epigenetic gene regulation in the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe heterochromatinization of the mat mat loci silences the mating type information encoded within these loci here we present the solution structure of the chromo domain from the cryptic loci regulator protein clr  clr is known to regulate silencing and switching at the mating type loci and to affect chromatin structure at centromeres clr and its human and drosophila homologs have been identified as histone h specific methyltransferases further implicating this family of proteins in chromatin remodeling our structure highlights a conserved surface that may be involved in chromo domain ligand interactions we have also analyzed two chromo domain mutants w g and w g that previously were shown to affect silencing and switching in full length clr  both mutants are significantly destabilized relative to wild type
