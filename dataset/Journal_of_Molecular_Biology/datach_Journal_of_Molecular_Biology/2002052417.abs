initiation factor if  thiostrepton and micrococcin prevent the binding of elongation factor g to the escherichia coli ribosome
the bacterial translational gtpases initiation factor if  elongation factors ef g and ef tu and release factor rf  are involved in all stages of translation and evidence indicates that they bind to overlapping sites on the ribosome whereupon gtp hydrolysis is triggered we provide evidence for a common ribosomal binding site for ef g and if  if prevents the binding of ef g to the ribosome as shown by western blot analysis and fusidic acid stabilized ef g gdp ribosome complex formation additionally if inhibits ef g dependent gtp hydrolysis on  s ribosomes the antibiotics thiostrepton and micrococcin which bind to part of the ef g binding site and interfere with the function of the factor also affect the function of if  while thiostrepton is a strong inhibitor of ef g dependent gtp hydrolysis gtp hydrolysis by if is stimulated by the drug micrococcin stimulates gtp hydrolysis by both factors we show directly that these drugs act by destabilizing the interaction of ef g with the ribosome and provide evidence that they have similar effects on if
