Proteasomal cleavage of proteins is the first step in the processing of most antigenic peptides that are presented to cytotoxic T cells. Still, its specificity and mechanism are not fully understood. To identify preferred sequence signals that are used for generation of antigenic peptides by the proteasome, we performed a rigorous analysis of the residues at the termini and flanking regions of naturally processed peptides eluted from MHC class I molecules. Our results show that both the C terminus (position P1 of the cleavage site) and its immediate flanking position (P1′) possess significant signals. The N termini of the peptides show these signals only weakly, consistent with previous findings that antigenic peptides may be cleaved by the proteasome with N-terminal extensions. Nevertheless, we succeed to demonstrate indirectly that the N-terminal cleavage sites contain the same preferred signals at position P1′. This reinforces previous findings regarding the role of the P1′ position of a cleavage site in determining the cleavage specificity, in addition to the well-known contribution of position P1. Our results apply to the generation of antigenic peptides and bare direct implications for the mechanism of proteasomal cleavage. We propose a model for proteasomal cleavage mechanism by which both ends of cleaved fragments are determined by the same cleavage signals, involving preferred residues at both P1 and P1′ positions of a cleavage site. The compatibility of this model with experimental data on protein degradation products and generation of antigenic peptides is demonstrated.
