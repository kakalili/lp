the crystal structure of mouse exo  reveals unique features of the mammalian exocyst
the exocyst is a eukaryotic tethering complex necessary for the fusion of exocytic vesicles with the plasma membrane its function in vivo is tightly regulated by interactions with multiple small gtpases exo  one of the eight subunits of the exocyst is important for the localization of the exocyst to the plasma membrane it interacts with tc  and rho gtpases in mammals and yeast respectively and has been shown recently to bind to the actin polymerization complex arp   here we present the crystal structure of mus musculus exo  at     resolution exo  is composed of  helices in a series of right handed helix turn helix motifs organized into a long rod of length     and width     although the  helical organization of this molecule is similar to that in saccharomyces cerevisiae exo  major structural differences are observed on the surface of the molecule at the domain boundaries and in various loop structures in particular the c terminal domain of m musculus exo  adopts a new orientation relative to the n terminal half not seen in s cerevisiae exo  structures given the low level of sequence conservation within exo  this structure provides new insights into our understanding of many species specific functions of the exocyst
