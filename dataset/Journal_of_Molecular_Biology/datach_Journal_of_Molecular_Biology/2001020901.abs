crystal structures of neuronal squid sec implicate inter domain hinge movement in the release of t snares edited by r huber
sec molecules associate with t snares from the syntaxin family in a heterodimeric complex that plays an essential role in vesicle transport and membrane fusion neuronal rat n sec has an arch shaped three domain structure which binds syntaxin a through contacts in domains  and  in both rat nsec and homologous squid s sec  a potential effector molecule binding pocket is shaped by residues from domains  and  and is localized on the opposite side of the syntaxin a interaction site comparison of several crystal forms of unliganded neuronal squid sec indicates a hinge region between domains  and  which allows domain  to rotate along a central axis this movement could release syntaxin a upon interaction with a yet unspecified sec effector molecule s  the binding of an effector protein may also directly affect the conformation of the helical hairpin of domain  which contributes the other significant syntaxin a binding sites in the rat nsec syntaxin a complex structure but adopts multiple conformations in the unliganded s sec structures reported here
