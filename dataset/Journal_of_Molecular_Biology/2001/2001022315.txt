Like many transposons the bacterial insertion sequence IS903 was thought to insert randomly. However, using both genetic and statistical approaches, we have derived a target site for IS903 that is used 84 % of the time. Computational and genetic analyses of multiple IS903 insertion sites predicted a preferred target consisting of a 21 bp palindromic pattern centered on the 9 bp target duplication generated during transposition. Here we show that targeting can be dissected into four components: the 5 bp flanking sequences, the most important sequences required for site-specific insertion; the 7 bp palindromic core within the target duplication; the dinucleotide pair at the transposon-target junction; and the local DNA context. Finally, using a substrate with multiple target sites we show that a target site is more likely found by a local bind-and-slide model and not by extended DNA tracking.
