from monomeric to homodimeric endonucleases and back engineering novel specificity of laglidadg enzymes
monomeric homing endonucleases of the laglidadg family recognize dna in a bipartite manner reflecting the underlying structural assembly of two protein domains a and b related by pseudo  fold symmetry this architecture allows for changes in dna specificity via the distinct combination of these half site domains the key to engineering such hybrid proteins lies in the laglidadg two helix bundle that forms both the domain interface and the endonuclease active site in this study we utilize domain a of the monomeric i dmoi to demonstrate the feasibility of generating functional homodimeric endonucleases that recognize palindromic dna sequences derived from the original non palindromic target wild type i dmoi domain a is capable of forming a homodimer h dmoa that binds tightly to but does not cleave efficiently its anticipated dna target partial restoration of dna cleavage ability was obtained by re engineering the laglidadg dimerization interface h dmoc  upon fusing two copies of h dmoc via a short peptide linker a novel site specific dna endonuclease was created h dmoc  like i dmoi h dmoc is thermostable and cleaves the new target dna to generate the predicted  nt   oh overhangs but unlike i dmoi h dmoc retains stringent cleavage specificity when substituting mn  for mg  as co factor this novel endonuclease allows speculation regarding specificity of monomeric laglidadg proteins while it supports the evolutionary genesis of these proteins by a gene duplication event
