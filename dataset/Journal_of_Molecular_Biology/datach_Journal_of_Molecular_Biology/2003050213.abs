crystal structure of a full length lysr type transcriptional regulator cbnr unusual combination of two subunit forms and molecular bases for causing and changing dna bend
the lysr type transcriptional regulator lttr proteins are one of the most common transcriptional regulators in prokaryotes here we report the crystal structure of cbnr which is one of the lttrs derived from ralstonia eutropha nh  this is the first crystal structure of a full length lttr cbnr was found to form a homo tetramer which seems to be a biologically active form surprisingly the tetramer can be regarded as a dimer of dimers whereby each dimer is composed of two subunits in different conformations in the cbnr tetramer the dna binding domains are located at the v shaped bottom of the main body of the tetramer and seem to be suitable to interact with a long stretch of the promoter dna which is approximately  bp interaction between the four dna binding domains and the two binding sites on the target dna is likely to bend the target dna along the v shaped bottom of the cbnr tetramer the relaxation of the bent dna which occurs upon inducer binding to cbnr seems to be associated with a quaternary structure change of the tetramer
