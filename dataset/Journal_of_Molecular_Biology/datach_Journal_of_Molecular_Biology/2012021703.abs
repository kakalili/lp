n terminal segments modulate the  helical propensities of the intrinsically disordered basic regions of bzip proteins
basic region leucine zippers bzips are modular transcription factors that play key roles in eukaryotic gene regulation the basic regions of bzips bzip brs are necessary and sufficient for dna binding and specificity bioinformatic predictions and spectroscopic studies suggest that unbound monomeric bzip brs are uniformly disordered as isolated domains here we test this assumption through a comparative characterization of conformational ensembles for  different bzip brs using a combination of atomistic simulations and circular dichroism measurements we find that bzip brs have quantifiable preferences for  helical conformations in their unbound monomeric forms this helicity varies from one bzip br to another despite a significant sequence similarity of the dna binding motifs dbms  our analysis reveals that intramolecular interactions between dbms and eight residue segments directly n terminal to dbms are the primary modulators of bzip br helicities we test the accuracy of this inference by designing chimeras of bzip brs to have either increased or decreased overall helicities our results yield quantitative insights regarding the relationship between sequence and the degree of intrinsic disorder within bzip brs and might have general implications for other intrinsically disordered proteins understanding how natural sequence variations lead to modulation of disorder is likely to be important for understanding the evolution of specificity in molecular recognition through intrinsically disordered regions idrs
