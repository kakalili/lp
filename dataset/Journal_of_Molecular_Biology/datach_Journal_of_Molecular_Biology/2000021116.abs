stator structure and subunit composition of the v v na atpase of the thermophilic bacterium caloramator fervidus edited by w baumeister
the v type na atpase of the thermophilic anaerobic bacterium caloramator fervidus was purified to homogeneity the subunit compositions of the catalytic v and membrane embedded v parts were determined and the structure of the enzyme complex was studied by electron microscopy the v headpiece consists of seven subunits present in one to three copies and the v part of two subunits in a ratio of   an analysis of over   single particle images obtained by electron microscopy of the purified v v enzyme complex revealed that the stalk region connecting the v and v parts contains two peripheral stalks in addition to a central stalk one of the two is connected to the v part while the other is connected to the first via a bar like structure that is positioned just above v  parallel with the plane of the membrane in projection this bar seems to contact the central stalk the data show that the stator structure that prevents rotation of the static part of v relative to v in the rotary catalysis mechanism of energy coupling in atpases atpsynthases is more complex than previously thought
