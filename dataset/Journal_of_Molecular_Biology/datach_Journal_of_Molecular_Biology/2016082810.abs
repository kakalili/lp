differential contributions of ubiquitin modified apobec g lysine residues to hiv  vif induced degradation
apolipoprotein b mrna editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide like g a g is a host restriction factor that impedes hiv  replication viral integrity is salvaged by hiv  virion infectivity factor vif  which mediates a g polyubiquitination and subsequent cellular depletion previous studies have implied that a g polyubiquitination is essential for vif induced degradation however the contribution of polyubiquitination to the rate of a g degradation remains unclear here we show that a g polyubiquitination is essential for degradation inhibition of ubiquitin activating enzyme e by pyr  or blocking the formation of ubiquitin chains by over expressing the lysine to arginine mutation of ubiquitin k  k r inhibited a g degradation our a g mutagenesis study showed that lysine residues        and   were not sufficient to render lysine free a g sensitive to vif mediated degradation our data also confirm that vif could induce ubiquitin chain formation on lysine residues interspersed throughout a g notably a g degradation relied on the lysine residues involved in polyubiquitination although a g and the a g c terminal mutant interacted with vif and were modified by ubiquitin chains the latter remained more resistant to vif induced degradation furthermore the a g c terminal mutant but not the n terminal mutant maintained potent antiviral activity in the presence of vif taken together our results suggest that the location of a g ubiquitin modification is a determinant for vif mediated degradation implying that in addition to polyubiquitination other factors may play a key role in the rate of a g degradation
