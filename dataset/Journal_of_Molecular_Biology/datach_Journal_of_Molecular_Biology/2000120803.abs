structure of membrane bound annexin a trimers a hybrid cryo em  x ray crystallography study
annexins constitute a family of phospholipid and ca  binding proteins involved in a variety of membrane related processes the property of several annexins including annexin a  to self organize at the surface of lipid membranes into d ordered arrays has been proposed to be functionally relevant in cellular contexts to further address this question we investigated the high resolution structure of annexin a trimers in membrane bound d crystals by cryo electron microscopy cryo em  a new d crystal form was discovered with p  symmetry which is significantly better ordered than the d crystals reported before a d projection map was obtained at    resolution revealing protein densities within each of the four domains characteristic of annexins a quantitative comparison was performed between this structure and models generated from the structure of the soluble form of annexin a in pseudo r  d crystals this analysis indicated that both structures are essentially identical except for small local changes attributed to membrane binding as a consequence and contrary to the common view annexin a molecules maintain their bent shape and do not flatten upon membrane binding which implies either that the four putative ca  and membrane binding loops present different types of interaction with the membrane surface or that the membrane surface is locally perturbed we propose that the trimerization of annexin a molecules is the relevant structural change occurring upon membrane binding the evidence that d arrays of annexin a trimers are responsible for its in vitro property of blood coagulation inhibition supports this conclusion
