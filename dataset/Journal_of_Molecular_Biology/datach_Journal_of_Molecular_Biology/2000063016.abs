premature termination of dna replication in plasmids carrying two inversely oriented cole origins edited by j karn
in escherichia coli plasmids carrying two inversely oriented cole origins dna replication initiates at only one of the two potential origins the other silent origin acts as a replication fork barrier whether this barrier is permanent or simply a pausing site remains unknown here we used a repeated primer extension assay to map in vivo at the nucleotide level the   end of the nascent strand where initiation and blockage of replication forks occurs initiation occurred primarily at the previously defined origin however an alternative initiation site was detected  bp upstream at the barrier the lagging strand also terminated at the main initiation site therefore the   end of the nascent strand at the barrier was identical to that generated during initiation this observation strongly suggests that blockage of the replication fork at the silent origin is not just a pausing site but permanent and leads to a premature termination event
