solution structure of human  cop direct evidences for structural similarity between cop i and clathrin adaptor coats
cop i coated vesicles are protein and lipid carriers that mediate intra golgi transport and transport from the cis golgi complex to the endoplasmic reticulum in cells the coatomer of the vesicles coat is comprised of seven subunits   cop   cop    cop   cop   cop   cop and  cop here we report the solution structure of a truncated form residues       cop   of human  cop total   residues  it is the first three dimensional structure of a  core  subunit of the cop i f subcomplex the structure of  cop  mainly consists of a disordered n terminal tail a five stranded antiparallel  sheet a two stranded antiparallel  sheet and five  helices the global folding of  cop  is very similar to the crystal structures of ap   and ap    directly demonstrating the structural similarity between the  core  subunits of the cop i f subcomplex and adaptor protein complexes through structural comparison and mutagenesis study we have also demonstrated that the heterodimers of  cop  and  cop have packing interfaces and relative subunit orientations similar to those of ap   and ap   heterodimers these results provide direct evidence supporting the previous proposal that the cop i f subcomplex and adaptor protein complexes have similar tertiary and quaternary structures
