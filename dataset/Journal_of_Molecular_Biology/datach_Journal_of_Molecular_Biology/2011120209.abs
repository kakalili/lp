structure of the escherichia coli phosphonate binding protein phnd and rationally optimized phosphonate biosensors
the phnd gene of escherichia coli encodes the periplasmic binding protein of the phosphonate pn uptake and utilization pathway we have crystallized and determined structures of e coli phnd ecphnd in the absence of ligand and in complex with the environmentally abundant  aminoethylphosphonate  aep  similar to other bacterial periplasmic binding proteins  aep binds near the center of mass of ecphnd in a cleft formed between two lobes comparison of the open unliganded structure with the closed aep bound structure shows that the two lobes pivot around a hinge by     between the two states extensive hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions stabilize aep which binds to ecphnd with low nanomolar affinity these structures provide insight into pn uptake by bacteria and facilitated the rational design of high signal to noise pn biosensors based on both coupled small molecule dyes and autocatalytic fluorescent proteins
