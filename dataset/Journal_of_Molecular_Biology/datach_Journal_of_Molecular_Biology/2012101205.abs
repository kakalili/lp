structural biochemical and functional characterization of the cyclic nucleotide binding homology domain from the mouse eag potassium channel
kcnh channels are voltage gated potassium channels with important physiological functions in these channels a c terminal cytoplasmic region known as the cyclic nucleotide binding homology cnb homology domain displays strong sequence similarity to cyclic nucleotide binding cnb domains however the isolated domain does not bind cyclic nucleotides here we report the x ray structure of the cnb homology domain from the mouse eag channel through comparison with the recently determined structure of the cnb homology domain from the zebrafish elk eag  like k  channel and the cnb domains from the mlotik and hcn hyperpolarization  activated cyclic nucleotide  gated potassium channels we establish the structural features of cnb homology domains that explain the low affinity for cyclic nucleotides our structure establishes that the  self liganded  conformation where two residues of the c terminus of the domain are bound in an equivalent position to cyclic nucleotides in cnb domains is a conserved feature of cnb homology domains importantly we provide biochemical evidence that suggests that there is also an unliganded conformation where the c terminus of the domain peels away from its bound position a functional characterization of this unliganded conformation reveals a role of the cnb homology domain in channel gating
