the structure of the soluble domain of an archaeal rieske iron  sulfur protein at    resolution
the first crystal structure of an archaeal rieske iron  sulfur protein the soluble domain of rieske iron  sulfur protein ii soxf from the hyperthermo acidophile sulfolobus acidocaldarius has been solved by multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion mad and has been refined to    resolution soxf is a subunit of the terminal oxidase supercomplex soxm in the plasma membrane of s acidocaldarius that combines features of a cytochrome bc complex and a cytochrome c oxidase the  fe  s cluster of soxf is most likely the primary electron acceptor during the oxidation of caldariella quinone by the cytochrome a  rieske subcomplex the geometry of the  fe  s cluster and the structure of the cluster binding site are almost identical in soxf and the rieske proteins from eucaryal cytochrome bc and b f complexes suggesting a strict conservation of the catalytic mechanism the main domain of soxf and part of the cluster binding domain though structurally related show a significantly divergent structure with respect to topology non covalent interactions and surface charges the divergent structure of soxf reflects a different topology of the soxm complex compared to eucaryal bc complexes and the adaptation of the protein to the extreme ambient conditions on the outer membrane surface of a hyperthermo acidophilic organism
