functional conservation of rna polymerase ii in fission and budding yeasts edited by m yanagida
the complementary dnas of the  subunits of fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe rna polymerase ii were expressed from strong promoters in saccharomyces cerevisiae and tested for heterospecific complementation by monitoring their ability to replace in vivo the null mutants of the corresponding host genes rpb and rpb  the two largest subunits and rpb  a small subunit shared by all three polymerases failed to support growth in s cerevisiae the remaining nine subunits were all proficient for heterospecific complementation and led in most cases to a wild type level of growth the two  like subunits rpb and rpb   however did not support growth at high    c or low    c temperatures in the case of rpb  growth was restored by increasing the gene dosage of the host rpb  or rpb  subunits confirming previous evidence of a close genetic interaction between these three subunits
