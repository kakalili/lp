rna dependent folding and stabilization of c protein during assembly of the e coli rnase p holoenzyme
the pre trna processing enzyme ribonuclease p is a ribonucleoprotein in escherichia coli assembly of the holoenzyme involves binding of the small   amino acid residue c protein to the much larger   nucleotide p rna subunit the rna subunit makes the majority of contacts to the pre trna substrate and contains the active site however binding of c stabilizes p rna folding and contributes to high affinity substrate binding here we show that rnase p ribonucleoprotein assembly also influences the folding of c protein thermal melting studies demonstrate that the free protein population is a mixture of folded and unfolded conformations under conditions where it assembles quantitatively with the rna subunit changes in the intrinsic fluorescence of a unique tryptophan residue located in the folded core of c provide further evidence for an rna dependent conformational change during rnase p assembly comparisons of the cd spectra of the free rna and protein subunits with that of the holoenzyme provide evidence for changes in p rna structure in the presence of c as indicated by previous studies importantly monitoring the temperature dependence of the cd signal in regions of the holoenzyme spectra that are dominated by protein or rna structure permitted analysis of the thermal melting of the individual subunits within the ribonucleoprotein these analyses reveal a significantly higher tm for c when bound to p rna and show that unfolding of the protein and rna are coupled these data provide evidence for a general mechanism in which the favorable free energy for formation of the rna  protein complex offsets the unfavorable free energy of structural rearrangements in the rna and protein subunits
