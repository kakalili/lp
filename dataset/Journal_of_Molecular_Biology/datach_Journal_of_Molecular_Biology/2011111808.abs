conservation of lipid functions in cytochrome bc complexes
lipid binding sites and properties are compared in two sub families of hetero oligomeric membrane protein complexes known to have similar functions in order to gain further understanding of the role of lipid in the function dynamics and assembly of these complexes using the crystal structure information for both complexes we compared the lipid binding properties of the cytochrome b f and bc complexes that function in photosynthetic and respiratory membrane energy transduction comparison of lipid and detergent binding sites in the b f complex with those in bc shows significant conservation of lipid positions seven lipid binding sites in the cyanobacterial b f complex overlap three natural sites in the chlamydomonas reinhardtii algal complex and four sites in the yeast mitochondrial bc complex the specific identity of lipids is different in b f and bc complexes b f contains sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol phosphatidylglycerol phosphatidylcholine monogalactosyldiacylglycerol and digalactosyldiacylglycerol whereas cardiolipin phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidic acid are present in the yeast bc complex the lipidic chlorophyll a and  carotene   car in cyanobacterial b f as well as eicosane in c reinhardtii are unique to the b f complex inferences of lipid binding sites and functions were supported by sequence interatomic distance and b factor information on interacting lipid groups and coordinating amino acid residues the lipid functions inferred in the b f complex are as follows  i substitution of a transmembrane helix by a lipid and chlorin ring  ii lipid and  car connection of peripheral and core domains  iii stabilization of the iron  sulfur protein transmembrane helix  iv n side charge and polarity compensation and v   car mediated super complex with the photosystem i complex
