thermal stability and atomic resolution crystal structure of the bacillus caldolyticus cold shock protein edited by d c rees
the bacterial cold shock proteins are small compact  barrel proteins without disulfide bonds cis proline residues or tightly bound cofactors bc csp the cold shock protein from the thermophile bacillus caldolyticus shows a twofold increase in the free energy of stabilization relative to its homolog bs cspb from the mesophile bacillus subtilis although the two proteins differ by only  out of  amino acid residues this pair of cold shock proteins thus represents a good system to study the atomic determinants of protein thermostability bs cspb and bc csp both unfold reversibly in cooperative transitions with tm values of    c and    c respectively at ph   addition of   m salt stabilizes bs cspb but destabilizes bc csp to understand these differences at the structural level the crystal structure of bc csp was determined at     resolution and refined to r      r free       the molecular structures of bc csp and bs cspb are virtually identical in the central  sheet and in the binding region for nucleic acids significant differences are found in the distribution of surface charges including a sodium ion binding site present in bc csp which was not observed in the crystal structure of the bs cspb electrostatic interactions are overall favorable for bc csp but unfavorable for bs cspb they provide the major source for the increased thermostability of bc csp this can be explained based on the atomic resolution crystal structure of bc csp it identifies a number of potentially stabilizing ionic interactions including a cation binding site and reveals significant changes in the electrostatic surface potential
