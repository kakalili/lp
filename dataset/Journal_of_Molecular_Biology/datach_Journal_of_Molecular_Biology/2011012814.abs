probing designability via a generalized model of helical bundle geometry
because the space of folded protein structures is highly degenerate with recurring secondary and tertiary motifs methods for representing protein structure in terms of collective physically relevant coordinates are of great interest by collapsing structural diversity to a handful of parameters such methods can be used to delineate the space of designable structures i e  conformations that can be stabilized with a large number of sequences  a crucial task for de novo protein design we first demonstrate this on natural  helical coiled coils using the crick parameterization we show that over   of known coiled coil structures are within    c  root mean square deviation of a crick ideal backbone derived parameters show that natural geometric space of coiled coils is highly restricted and can be represented by  allowed  conformations amidst a potential continuum of conformers allowed structures have   restricted axial offsets between helices which differ starkly between parallel and anti parallel structures   preferred superhelical radii which depend linearly on the oligomerization state   pronounced radius dependent a and d position amino acid propensities and   discrete angles of rotation of helices about their axes which are surprisingly independent of oligomerization state or orientation in all we estimate the space of designable coiled coil structures to be reduced at least   fold relative to the space of geometrically feasible structures to extend the benefits of structural parameterization to other systems we developed a general mathematical framework for parameterizing arbitrary helical structures which reduces to the crick parameterization as a special case the method is successfully validated on a set of non coiled coil helical bundles frequent in channels and transporter proteins which show significant helix bending but not supercoiling programs for coiled coil parameter fitting and structure generation are provided via a web interface at http  www gevorggrigoryan com cccp  and code for generalized helical parameterization is available upon request
