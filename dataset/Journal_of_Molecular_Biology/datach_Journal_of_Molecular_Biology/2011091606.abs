the structure of cdk cycc implicates specificity in the cdk cyclin family and reveals interaction with a deep pocket binder
cyclin dependent kinase cdk  associates with cyclin c cycc and belongs to the cdk module of the mediator of transcription together with med  and med  cdk is involved in the regulation of mrna transcription and was identified as a potent oncogene in colon cancerogenesis we have solved the    crystal structure of cdk cycc in complex with sorafenib an anti cancer drug of clinical relevance the cdk structure reveals a unique cycc recognition helix that explains the specificity of the cdk cycc pair and discrimination among the highly promiscuous binding in the cdk cyclin family in contrast to all cdks the cdk activation loop appears not to be phosphorylated based on the structure we discuss an alternate mode of cdk activation to the general cdk activation by t loop phosphorylation sorafenib binds to the catalytic cleft of cdk  it displays a deep pocket binding mode and is the first small molecule to induce a dfg out conformation in the cdk family which is actually dmg out in cdk
