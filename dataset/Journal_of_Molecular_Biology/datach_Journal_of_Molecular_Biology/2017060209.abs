trem ligand interactions in health and disease
the protein triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells  trem  is an immunomodulatory receptor with a central role in myeloid cell activation and survival in recent years the importance of trem has been highlighted by the identification of coding variants that increase risk for alzheimer s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases animal studies have further shown the importance of trem in neurodegenerative and other inflammatory disease models including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease multiple sclerosis and stroke a mechanistic understanding of trem function remains elusive however due in part to the absence of conclusive information regarding the identity of endogenous trem ligands while many trem ligands have been proposed their physiological role and mechanism of engagement remain to be determined in this review we highlight the suggested roles of trem in these diseases and the recent advances in our understanding of trem and discuss putative trem  ligand interactions and their potential roles in signaling during health and disease we develop a model based on the trem structure to explain how different trem ligands might interact with the receptor and how disease risk variants may alter ligand interactions finally we propose future experimental directions to establish the role and importance of these different interactions on trem function
