structure based analysis of gpcr function evidence for a novel pentameric assembly between the dimeric leukotriene b receptor blt and the g protein
we produced human leukotriene b  ltb  receptor blt as a recombinant protein in escherichia coli this detergent solubilized receptor displays two states with regard to its affinity for ltb  i a low affinity state ka     m   that involves a receptor homodimer blt  ltb   we report evidence for a central role of the sixth transmembrane helix in regulating the stability of this homodimer  ii a high affinity state ka     m   upon interaction of the receptor with the heterotrimeric gdp loaded g protein g i     association of the g protein with recombinant blt induces gdp gtp exchange by the g  subunit these results indicate that isolated blt is fully representative of the in vivo receptor with regard to high affinity recognition of ltb  association with a g protein and activation of g  using a combination of mass spectrometry after chemical cross linking and neutron scattering in solution with the native complex we establish unambiguously that only one g protein trimer binds to a receptor dimer to form the stoichiometrically defined blt  ltb  g i    pentameric assembly this suggests that receptor dimerization could be crucial to transduction of the ltb induced signal
