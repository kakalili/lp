celastrol inhibits tat mediated human immunodeficiency virus hiv transcription and replication
current drugs used for antiretroviral therapy against human immunodeficiency virus hiv have a narrow spectrum of activity and more often have associated toxicities and severe side effects in addition to developing resistance thus there is a need to develop new therapeutic strategies against hiv aids to complement the already existing ones surprisingly transactivator of transcription tat  an early virus encoded protein required for the efficient transcription of the hiv genome has not been developed as a target for small molecular therapeutics we have previously described the ability of an endogenous michael acceptor electrophile mae   deoxy     prostaglandin j   d pgj  to inhibit tat dependent transcription by targeting its cysteine cys rich domain in an effort to identify other maes possessing inhibitory activity against hiv  tat we tested a collection of plant derived compounds with electrophilic properties including curcumin rosmarinic acid and gambogic acid for their ability to inhibit tat celastrol cel  a triterpenoid mae isolated from tripterygium wilfordii exhibited the highest inhibitory activity against tat using biochemical techniques we demonstrate that cel by covalently modifying the cysteine thiols inhibits tat transactivation function using circular dichroism spectroscopy we show that alkylation of tat brought about a change in the secondary structure of tat which inhibited the transcription elongation of the hiv proviral genome by effecting mechanisms other than tat  tar transactivation responsive region interaction our results demonstrate the underlying mechanism of antiretroviral activity of the plant derived maes and suggest that cel could serve as a lead compound to develop novel antiviral therapeutics
