nmr structure of the euplotes raikovi pheromone er  and identification of its five disulfide bonds edited by m f summers
the nmr solution structure of the  residue pheromone er  from the ciliated protozoan euplotes raikovi e r was calculated with the torsion angle dynamics program dyana from   nuclear overhauser enhancement noe upper limit distance constraints   dihedral angle constraints and  disulfide bond constraints the disulfide bridges had not been assigned by chemical methods and initially were assigned tentatively on the basis of inspection of the positioning of the cys sulfhydryl groups in a bundle of  conformers that was calculated without disulfide bond constraints the assignment of disulfide bridges was then validated by structure calculations that assessed the compatibility of plausible alternative cys cys disulfide combinations with the input of noe upper distance constraints and dihedral angle constraints for a group of  conformers used to characterize the solution structure the average pairwise root mean square distances from the mean coordinates calculated for the backbone heavy atoms n c  and c  of resideus    is     the molecular architecture consists of a three dimensional arrangement of five helices comprised of residues                 and     with five disulfide bridges in the positions                  and     which has so far not been represented in the protein data bank e r  is unique among presently known e r pheromones with respect to size sequence the number of disulfide bonds and the three dimensional structure thus providing a new structural basis for rationalizing the physiological functions of this protein family
