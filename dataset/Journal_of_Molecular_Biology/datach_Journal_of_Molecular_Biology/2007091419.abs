chk instability is coupled to mitotic cell death of p  deficient cells in response to virus induced dna damage signaling
adeno associated virus aav dna by mimicking a stalled replication fork provokes a dna damage response that can arrest cells in the g m phase of the cell cycle this response depends strictly on dna damage signaling kinases atr and chk  here we used aav to study long term effects of dna damage signaling in cells with altered p  status in hct  cells in response to damage signaling p  represses transcription of the genes encoding mitotic regulators cdc c cyclin b  and plk to establish a firm g arrest isogenic cells lacking p  maintain these three proteins at constant levels yet can still arrest initially in g because chk signaling inhibits their enzymatic activities unexpectedly the levels of chk fall abruptly in a proteasome dependent manner after two days of arrest in g  in p  deficient cells this chk instability is coupled to recovery of the phosphatase activity of cdc c and in the kinase activities of plk and cdk cyclin b  consequently the p  deficient cells enter lethal mitosis thus the chk mediated arrest is transient it initially causes cells to accumulate in g until p  dependent transcriptional repression of mitotic proteins takes over p  deficient cells cannot maintain the dna damage signaling induced g arrest after chk has disappeared and continue into catastrophic mitosis restoring chk prevents the cells from entering such mitosis these results reveal a mechanism based on chk stability that regulates mitotic entry after dna damage and elucidate the controversial phenomenon of p  promoted cell survival in the face of damage signaling
