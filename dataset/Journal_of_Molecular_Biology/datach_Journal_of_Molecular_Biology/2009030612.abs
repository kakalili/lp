interaction in vivo between the two matrix attachment regions flanking a single chromatin loop
in interphase nuclei as in metaphase chromosomes the genome is organized into topologically closed loop domains here we have mapped the ends of the loop domain that contains the ifng interferon   gene in primary and cultured murine t lymphocytes to determine whether the ends of the loop are located in close proximity to each other in the nuclear space the c chromosome conformation capture technique which detects protein mediated dna  dna interactions was utilized a strong interaction was demonstrated between the two ends of the loop which were close enough to become cross linked in vivo in the presence of paraformaldehyde chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with the c technique demonstrated that topoisomerase ii  and mecp  but not topoisomerase ii  heterochromatin associated protein hp or ctcf were involved in this interaction the present findings have important implications in terms of mechanisms of illegitimate recombination that can result in chromosomal translocations and deletions
