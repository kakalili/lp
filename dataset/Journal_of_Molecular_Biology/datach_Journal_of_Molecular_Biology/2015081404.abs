when too much atp is bad for protein synthesis
adenosine triphosphate atp is the energy currency of living cells even though atp powers virtually all energy dependent activities most cellular atp is utilized in protein synthesis via trna aminoacylation and guanosine triphosphate regeneration magnesium mg   the most common divalent cation in living cells plays crucial roles in protein synthesis by maintaining the structure of ribosomes participating in the biochemistry of translation initiation and functioning as a counterion for atp a non physiological increase in atp levels hinders growth in cells experiencing mg  limitation because atp is the most abundant nucleotide triphosphate in the cell and mg  is also required for the stabilization of the cytoplasmic membrane and as a cofactor for essential enzymes we propose that organisms cope with mg  limitation by decreasing atp levels and ribosome production thereby reallocating mg  to indispensable cellular processes
