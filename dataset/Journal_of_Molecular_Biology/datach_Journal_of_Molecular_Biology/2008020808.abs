fluorescence resonance energy transfer between residues on troponin and tropomyosin in the reconstituted thin filament modeling the troponin  tropomyosin complex
troponin tn  in association with tropomyosin tm  plays a central role in the calcium regulation of striated muscle contraction fluorescence resonance energy transfer fret between probes attached to the tn subunits tnc tni tnt and to tm was measured to study the spatial relationship between tn and tm on the thin filament we generated single cysteine mutants of rabbit skeletal muscle  tm tni and the  tnt  kda fragment the energy donor was attached to a single cysteine residue at position            or   on tnt at  on tnc and at      or   on tni while the energy acceptor was located at                    or   on tm fret analysis showed a distinct ca  induced conformational change of the tm  tn complex and revealed that tnt  and tnt  were closer to tm  than tm   indicating that the elongated n terminal region of tnt extends beyond the beginning of the next tm molecule on the actin filament using the atomic coordinates of the crystal structures of tm and the tn core domain we searched for the disposition and orientation of these structures by minimizing the deviations of the calculated fret efficiencies from the observed fret efficiencies in order to construct atomic models of the tn  tm complex with and without bound ca  in the best fit models the tn core domain is located on residues      of tm with the arrowhead shaped i t arm tilting toward the c terminus of tm the angle between the tm axis and the long axis of tnc is     and     with and without bound ca  respectively the models indicate that the long axis of tnc is perpendicular to the thin filament without bound ca  and that tnc and the i t arm tilt toward the filament axis and rotate around the tm axis by     upon ca  binding
