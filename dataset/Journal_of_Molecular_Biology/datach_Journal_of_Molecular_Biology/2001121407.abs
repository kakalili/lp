crystal structure of the transcription elongation anti termination factor nusa from mycobacterium tuberculosis at    resolution edited by k nagai
mycobacterium tuberculosis is the cause of tuberculosis in humans a disease that affects over a one third of the world  s population this slow growing pathogen has only one ribosomal rna operon thus making its transcriptional apparatus a fundamentally interesting target for drug discovery nusa binds to rna polymerase and modulates several of the ribosomal rna transcriptional processes here we report the crystal structure of nusa and reveal that the molecule consists of four domains they are organised as two distinct entities the n terminal domain residues  to   that resembles the b chain of the rad cd atp binding cassette atpase abc atpase and a c terminal module residues   to   consisting of a ribosomal s protein domain followed by two k homology domains the s and kh domains are tightly integrated together to form an extensive rna binding structure but are flexibly tethered to the n terminal domain the molecule  s surfaces and architecture provide insights into rna and polymerase interactions and the mechanism of pause site discrimination they also allow us to rationalize certain termination defective and cold shock sensitive mutations in the nusa gene that have been studied in escherichia coli
