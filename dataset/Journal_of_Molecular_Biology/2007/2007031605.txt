The first contact of a virus with the host cell surface and further entry are important steps for a successful outcome of the infection process and for the virus-associated pathogenicity.We have previously shown that the entry of the murine Polyomavirus (Py) into fibroblasts is a multi-step process involving, at least, the attachment to primary sialic acids (SA)-containing cell receptors followed by post-binding interaction with secondary receptors, such as the α4β1 integrin, likely through the VP1-LDV motif.Here we report on the functional role of the VP1-LDV motif in Py infectivity and in vivo virus tissue tropism. For this purpose, we have characterized a recombinant virus mutant, PyLNV, harboring a single aa substitution in this motif (D138N). Although not critical for virus viability, the D138N substitution abrogates the post-attachment Py–α4β1 interaction, rendering the PyLNV mutant virus twofold less infectious than the Py wild-type (Wt) in α4β1-positive fibroblasts.To study the putative role of the VP1-LDV motif in vivo, newborn C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with PyWt or PyLNV and, after six days, organs were analyzed for the presence of viral DNA. Intriguingly, PyLNV showed an altered spectrum of in vivo replication compared with PyWt, particularly in the skin and in the kidney. The implication of Py–α4β1 integrin interaction in conditioning tissue-specificity of virus replication is discussed.
