a structural informatics approach for mining  sheets locating sheets in intermediate resolution density maps
here we report a new computational method called sheetminer for mining  sheets in the density maps at intermediate resolutions of  to    the method employs a multi step ad hoc morphological analysis of density maps to identify the unique characteristics of  sheets it was tested on density maps from  protein crystal structures that were artificially blurred to intermediate resolutions there are a total of  independent  sheets with a wide distribution of morphology the method successfully located  of them and missed only one the method was also applied to an experimental   electron cryomicroscopic structure and an   x ray density map in both cases the sheet searching results were found to agree very well with known high resolution crystal structures collectively these results demonstrate clearly the robustness of sheetminer in locating the regions belonging to  sheets in the intermediate resolution density maps furthermore sheetminer is completely complementary to all other existing computational methods including helixhunter and threading algorithms their combined usage has the potential to significantly enhance the computational modeling capacity for a much more complete interpretation of structural data at intermediate resolutions from which extraction of functional information would be more effective this is particularly important in the field of structural genomics in which the fast screening approach may not always yield crystals that diffract to atomic resolution an exciting future application of sheetminer is as a valuable tool for revealing the structures of amyloid fibrils that are rich in  motifs
