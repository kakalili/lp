The effects of four single macromolecular crowding agents, Ficoll 70, dextran 70, polyethylene glycol (PEG) 2000, and calf thymus DNA (CT DNA), and three mixed crowding agents containing both CT DNA and polysaccharide (or PEG 2000) on the refolding of guanidine hydrochloride-denatured rabbit muscle creatine kinase (MM-CK) have been examined by activity assay. When the total concentration of the mixed crowding agent is 100 g/l, in which the weight ratio of CT DNA to Ficoll 70 is 1:9, the refolding yield of MM-CK after refolding for 3 h under these conditions increases 23% compared with that in the presence of 10 g/l CT DNA, 18% compared with 100 g/l Ficoll 70, and 19% compared with that in the absence of crowding agents. A remarkable increase in the refolding yield of MM-CK by a mixed crowding agent containing CT DNA and dextran 70 (or PEG 2000) is also observed. Further folding kinetics analyses show that these three mixed crowding agents remarkably accelerate the refolding of MM-CK, compared with single crowding agents. Aggregation of MM-CK in the presence of any of the three mixed crowding agents is less serious than that in the presence of a single crowding agent at the same concentration but more serious than that in the absence of crowding agents. Both the refolding yield and the refolding rate of MM-CK in mixtures of these agents are increased relative to the individual agents by themselves, indicating that mixed macromolecular crowding agents are more favorable to MM-CK folding and can be used to reflect the physiological environment more accurately than single crowding agents.
