lipid mediated folding unfolding of phospholamban as a regulatory mechanism for the sarcoplasmic reticulum ca  atpase
the integral membrane protein complex between phospholamban pln and sarcoplasmic reticulum ca  atpase serca regulates cardiac contractility in the unphosphorylated form pln binds serca and inhibits ca  flux upon phosphorylation of pln at ser  the inhibitory effect is reversed although structural details on both proteins are emerging from x ray crystallography cryo electron microscopy and nmr studies the molecular mechanisms of their interactions and regulatory process are still lacking it has been speculated that serca regulation depends on pln structural transitions order to disorder i e  folding unfolding  here we investigated pln conformational changes upon chemical unfolding by a combination of electron paramagnetic resonance and nmr spectroscopies revealing that the conformational transitions involve mostly the cytoplasmic regions with two concomitant phenomena   membrane binding and folding of the amphipathic domain ia and   folding unfolding of the juxtamembrane domain ib of pln analysis of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated pln with two phosphomimetic mutants of pln s e and s d shows that the population of an unfolded state in domains ia and ib t  state is linearly correlated to the extent of serca inhibition measured by activity assays inhibition of serca is carried out by the folded ground state t state of the protein pln  while the relief of inhibition involves promotion of pln to excited conformational states ser  phosphorylated pln  we propose that pln population shifts folding unfolding are a key regulatory mechanism for serca
