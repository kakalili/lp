computational analysis of the chiral action of type ii dna topoisomerases
it was found recently that bacterial type ii dna topoisomerase topo iv is much more efficient in relaxing   dna supercoiling than    supercoiling this means that the dna  enzyme complex is chiral this chirality can appear upon binding the first segment that participates in the strand passing reaction g segment or only after the second segment t segment joins the complex the former possibility is analyzed here we assume that upon binding the enzyme the g segment forms a part of left handed helical turn this model is an extension of the hairpin model introduced earlier to explain simplification of dna topology by these enzymes using statistical  mechanical simulation of dna properties we estimated different consequences of the model   relative rates of relaxation of   and    supercoiling by the enzyme   the distribution of positions of the g segment in supercoiled molecules   steady state distribution of knots in circular molecules created by the topoisomerase   the variance of topoisomer distribution created by the enzyme   the effect of   and    supercoiling on the binding topo ii with g segment the simulation results are capable of explaining nearly all available experimental data at least semiquantitatively a few predictions obtained in the model analysis can be tested experimentally
