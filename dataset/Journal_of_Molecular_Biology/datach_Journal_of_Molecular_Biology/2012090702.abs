structure and catalytic mechanism of a cyclic dipeptide prenyltransferase with broad substrate promiscuity
fungal indole prenyltransferases pts typically act on specific substrates and they are able to prenylate their target compounds with remarkably high regio and stereoselectivity similar to several indole pts characterized to date the cyclic dipeptide n prenyltransferase cdpnpt is able to prenylate a range of diverse substrates thus exhibiting an unusually broad substrate promiscuity to define the structural basis for this promiscuity we have determined crystal structures of unliganded cdpnpt and of a ternary complex of cdpnpt bound to s benzodiazepinedione and thiolodiphosphate analysis of the structures reveals a limited number of specific interactions with s benzodiazepinedione which projects into a largely hydrophobic surface this surface can also accommodate other substrates explaining the ability of the enzyme to prenylate a range of compounds the location of the bound substrates suggests a likely reaction mechanism for the conversion of s benzodiazepinedione structure guided mutagenesis experiments confirm that in addition to s benzodiazepinedione cdpnpt can also act on r benzodiazepinedione and several cyclic dipeptides albeit with relaxed specificity finally nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrates that cdpnpt is a c  reverse pt that catalyzes the formation of c   prenylated indolines from diketopiperazines of tryptophan containing cyclic dipeptides
