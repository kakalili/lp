three dimensional domain swapping in nitrollin a single domain   crystallin from nitrosospira multiformis controls protein conformation and stability but not dimerization
the   crystallin superfamily has a well characterized protein fold with several members found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic worlds a majority of them contain two   crystallin domains a few examples such as ciona crystallin and spherulin a exist that represent the eukaryotic single domain proteins of this superfamily this study reports the high resolution crystal structure of a single domain   crystallin protein nitrollin from the ammonium oxidizing soil bacterium nitrosospira multiformis the structure retains the characteristic   crystallin fold despite a very low sequence identity the protein exhibits a unique case of homodimerization in   crystallins by employing its n terminal extension to undergo three dimensional  d domain swapping with its partner removal of the swapped strand results in partial loss of structure and stability but not dimerization per se as determined using gel filtration and equilibrium unfolding studies overall nitrollin represents a distinct single domain prokaryotic member that has evolved a specialized mode of dimerization hitherto unknown in the realm of   crystallins
