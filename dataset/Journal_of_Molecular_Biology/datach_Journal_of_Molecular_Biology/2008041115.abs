dynamics of recognition between trna and elongation factor tu
elongation factor tu ef tu binds to all standard aminoacyl transfer rnas aa trnas and transports them to the ribosome while protecting the ester linkage between the trna and its cognate amino acid we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the dynamics of the ef tu guanosine   triphosphate aa trnacys complex and the roles played by mg  ions and modified nucleosides on the free energy of protein rna binding individual modified nucleosides have pronounced effects on the structural dynamics of trna and the ef tu cys trnacys interface combined energetic and evolutionary analyses identify the coevolution of residues in ef tu and aa trnas at the binding interface highly conserved ef tu residues are responsible for both attracting aa trnas as well as providing nearby nonbonded repulsive energies that help fine tune molecular attraction at the binding interface in addition to the   cca end highly conserved trna nucleotides g  g  g  and u  contribute significantly to ef tu binding energies modification of u  to thymine affects the structure of the trna common loop resulting in a change in binding interface contacts in addition other nucleotides conserved within certain trna specificities may be responsible for tuning aa trna binding to ef tu the trend in ef tu cys trnacys binding energies observed as the result of mutating the trna agrees with experimental observation we also predict variations in binding free energies upon misacylation of trnacys with d cysteine or o phosphoserine and upon changing the protonation state of l cysteine principal components analysis in each case reveals changes in the communication network across the protein trna interface and is the basis for the entropy calculations
