dna directed dna polymerase and strand displacement activity of the reverse transcriptase encoded by the r retrotransposon
r elements are non long terminal repeat non ltr retrotransposons with a single open reading frame encoding reverse transcriptase dna endonuclease and nucleic acid binding domains the elements are specialized for insertion into the   s rrna genes of many animal phyla the r encoded activities initiate retrotransposition by sequence specific cleavage of the   s gene target site and the utilization of the released dna   end to prime reverse transcription target primed reverse transcription  the activity of the r polymerase on rna templates has been shown to differ from retroviral reverse transcriptases rts in a number of properties we demonstrate that the r rt is capable of efficiently utilizing single stranded dna ssdna as a template the processivity of the enzyme on ssdna templates is higher than its processivity on rna templates this finding suggests that r rt is also capable of synthesizing the second dna strand during retrotransposition however r rt lacks the rnase h activity that is typically used by retroviral and ltr retrotransposon rts to remove the rna strand before the first dna strand is used as template remarkably r rt can displace rna strands that are annealed to ssdna templates with essentially no loss of processivity such strand displacement activity is highly unusual for a dna polymerase thus the single r protein contains all the activities needed to make a double stranded dna product from an rna transcript finally during these studies we found an unexpected property of the highly sequence specific r endonuclease domain the endonuclease can non specifically cleave ssdna at a junction with double stranded dna this activity suggests that second strand cleavage of the target site may not be sequence specific but rather is specified by a single stranded region generated when the first dna strand is used to prime reverse transcription
