ensemble structure of the modular and flexible full length vesicular stomatitis virus phosphoprotein
the phosphoprotein p is an essential component of the viral replication machinery of non segmented negative  strand rna viruses connecting the viral polymerase to its nucleoprotein  rna template and acting as a chaperone of the nucleoprotein by preventing nonspecific encapsidation of cellular rnas the phosphoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus vsv forms homodimers and possesses a modular organization comprising two stable well structured domains concatenated with two intrinsically disordered regions here we used a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and small angle x ray scattering to depict vsv p as an ensemble of continuously exchanging conformers that captures the dynamic character of this protein we discuss the implications of the dynamics and the large conformational space sampled by vsv p in the assembly and functioning of the viral transcription replication machinery
