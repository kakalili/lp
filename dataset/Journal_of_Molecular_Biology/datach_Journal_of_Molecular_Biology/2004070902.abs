structure of thermus thermophilus  keto  deoxygluconate kinase evidence for recognition of an open chain substrate
keto  deoxygluconate kinase kdgk catalyzes the phosphorylation of  keto  deoxygluconate kdg to  keto  deoxy  phosphogluconate kdgp  the genome sequence of thermus thermophilus hb contains an open reading frame that has a   identity to escherichia coli kdgk the kdgk activity of t thermophilus protein ttkdgk has been confirmed and its crystal structure has been determined by the molecular replacement method and refined with two crystal forms to    and    respectively the enzyme is a hexamer organized as a trimer of dimers each subunit is composed of two domains a larger    domain and a smaller  sheet domain similar to that of ribokinase and adenosine kinase members of the pfkb family of carbohydrate kinases furthermore the ttkdgk structure with its kdg and atp analogue was determined and refined at    the bound kdg was observed predominantly as an open chain structure the positioning of ligands and the conservation of important catalytic residues suggest that the reaction mechanism is likely to be similar to that of other members of the pfkb family including ribokinase in particular the asp  is postulated to have a role in transferring the  phosphate of atp to the   hydroxyl group of kdg
