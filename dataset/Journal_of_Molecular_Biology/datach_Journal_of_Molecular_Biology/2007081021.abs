recruitment of rna polymerase ii in the ifng gene promoter correlates with the nuclear matrix association in activated t helper cells
recruitment of the rna polymerase ii transcription complex to the promoter of the ifng gene has been studied by chromatin immunoprecipitation chip in activated functionally different cd  t helper th cell subsets in parallel analysis of association of the nuclear scaffold matrix with the ifng gene promoter has been carried out the rna polymerase ii rna pol ii interacted with the ifng gene promoter in analyzed activated neutral th cells ifn  producing th cells and ifn  silent th cells however the interaction of the ifng gene promoter with the nuclear matrix occurred differentially in a lineage specific manner the pattern of the nuclear matrix interaction correlated directly with the gene expression strong association of the promoter with the nuclear matrix was observed only in the th cell subset where the ifng gene was actively transcribed we propose that it is the interaction of the ifng gene promoter with the nuclear matrix that may set off transcription in activated th cells by promoter associated rna pol ii
