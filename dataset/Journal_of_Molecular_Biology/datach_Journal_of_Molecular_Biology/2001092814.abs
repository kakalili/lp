substrate specificity determinants of human macrophage elastase mmp   based on the    crystal structure edited by i wilson
the macrophage elastase enzyme mmp   expressed mainly in alveolar macrophages has been identified in the mouse lung as the main destructive agent associated with cigarette smoking which gives rise to emphysema both directly via elastin degradation and indirectly by disturbing the proteinase antiproteinase balance via inactivation of the   proteinase inhibitor   pi  the antagonist of the leukocyte elastase the catalytic domain of human recombinant mmp  has been crystallized in complex with the broad specificity inhibitor batimastat bb   the crystal structure analysis of this complex determined using x ray data to    and refined to an r value of    reveals an overall fold similar to that of other mmps however the s shaped double loop connecting strands iii and iv is fixed closer to the  sheet and projects its his  side chain further into the rather hydrophobic active site cleft defining the s and the s pockets and separating them from each other to a larger extent than is observed in other mmps the s site is planar while the characteristic s   subsite is a continuous tube rather than a pocket in which the mmp  specific thr  replaces a val residue otherwise highly conserved in almost all other mmps this alteration might allow mmp  to accept p   arg residues making it unique among mmps the active site cleft of mmp  is well equipped to bind and efficiently cleave the alametphe leugluala sequence in the reactive site loop of   pi as occurs experimentally similarities in contouring and particularly a common surface hydrophobicity both inside and distant from the active site cleft explain why mmp  shares many substrates with matrilysin mmp   the mmp  structure is an excellent template for the structure based design of specific inhibitors for emphysema therapy and for the construction of mutants to clarify the role of this mmp
