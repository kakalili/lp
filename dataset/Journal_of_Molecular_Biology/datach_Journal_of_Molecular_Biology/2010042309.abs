conformational dynamics of the escherichia coli dna polymerase manager proteins umud and umud
the expression of escherichia coli umud gene products is upregulated as part of the sos response to dna damage umud is initially produced as a   amino acid protein which subsequently cleaves off its n terminal  amino acids in a reaction dependent on reca single stranded dna giving umud   the two forms of the umud gene products play different roles in the cell umud is implicated in a primitive dna damage checkpoint and prevents dna polymerase iv dependent   frameshift mutagenesis while the cleaved form facilitates umuc dependent mutagenesis via formation of dna polymerase v umud  c  thus the cleavage of umud is a crucial switch that regulates replication and mutagenesis via numerous protein  protein interactions a umud variant umud a which is noncleavable but is a partial biological mimic of the cleaved form umud   has been identified we used hydrogen  deuterium exchange mass spectrometry hxms to probe the conformations of umud umud   and umud a in hxms experiments backbone amide hydrogens that are solvent accessible or not involved in hydrogen bonding become labeled with deuterium over time our hxms results reveal that the n terminal arm of umud which is truncated in the cleaved form umud   is dynamic residues that are likely to contact the n terminal arm show more deuterium exchange in umud  and umud a than in umud these observations suggest that noncleavable umud a mimics the cleaved form umud  because in both cases the arms are relatively unbound from the globular domain gas phase hydrogen exchange experiments which specifically probe the exchange of side chain hydrogens and are carried out on shorter timescales than solution experiments show that umud  incorporates more deuterium than either umud or umud a this work indicates that these three forms of the umud gene products are highly flexible which is of critical importance for their many protein interactions
