all atom simulations of structures and energetics of c di gmp bound and free pled
cyclic diguanosine monophosphate is a bacterial second messenger involved in a lifestyle switch from single cells to biofilm formation atomistic simulations are used to characterize inhibited diguanylate cyclase dgc pled with emphasis on the feedback inhibition mechanism normal mode calculations show a rigidification particularly in both the inhibition site and the active site of the protein upon ligand binding extensive molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent and analysis of the dynamical cross correlation maps suggest two distinct coupling pathways between the active and the inhibition site direct information transfer either through the  strands   and   of the dgc domain pathway i or via the disordered regions connecting domains d and dgc pathway ii  in addition dynamical cross correlation maps show differences in the correlation between neighboring domains upon ligand binding and upon the point mutation r  a the correlated motions between domains d and d  which form the dimerization interface are stronger for free pled complementary to the experimentally observed short range interactions in ligated pled the present work also characterizes the long range delocalized interactions between domains that are important for understanding activation and allosteric control of the protein based on the results experimental characterization of the point mutant r  and of the double mutant n  h  is proposed to differentiate between pathways i and ii
