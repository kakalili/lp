outlining folding nuclei in globular proteins
our theoretical approach for prediction of folding unfolding nuclei in three dimensional protein structures is based on a search for free energy saddle points on networks of protein unfolding pathways under some approximations this search is performed rapidly by dynamic programming and results in prediction of  values which can be compared with those found experimentally in this study we optimize some details of the model specifically hydrogen atoms are taken into account in addition to heavy atoms  and compare the theoretically obtained and experimental  values which characterize involvement of residues in folding nuclei for all  proteins where  values are now known for many residues we show that the model provides good  value predictions for proteins whose structures have been determined by x ray analysis the average correlation coefficient is    with a more limited success for proteins whose structures have been determined by nmr techniques only the average correlation coefficient is    and that the transition state free energies computed from the same model are in a good anticorrelation with logarithms of experimentally measured folding rates at mid transition the correlation coefficient is
