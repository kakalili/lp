bioactivity of folding intermediates studied by the recovery of enzymatic activity during refolding
the peptide bond preceding proline residues realizes a cis trans conformational switch with high switching resistance in native proteins and folding intermediates therefore individual isomers have the potential to differ in bioactivity however information about isomer specific bioactivities is difficult to obtain because of the risk of affecting isomeric distribution by bioactivity assay components here we present an approach that allows for the measurement of the recovery of enzymatic activities of wild type rnase t and rnase t variants during refolding under conditions where the population of enzyme  substrate or enzyme  product complexes is negligible recovery of enzymatic activity was continuously monitored within the visible range of the spectrum by addition of a fluorescence labeled nucleotide substrate to the refolding sample we found that a nonnative trans conformation at pro  renders the rnase t almost completely inactive a folding intermediate having a nonnative trans conformation at pro  shows about   of the enzymatic activity referred to the native state pro  in contrast to the active site located pro  is situated in a solvent exposed loop region remote from active site residues in both cases peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerases accelerate the regain of nucleolytic activity our findings show that even if there is a considerable distance between the site of isomerization and the active site conformational control of the bioactivity of proteins is likely to occur and that the surface location of prolyl bonds suffices for the control of buried active sites mediated by peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerases
