structural analysis of the n terminal domain of the human t cell leukemia virus capsid protein edited by m f summers
the n terminal domain of the retroviral capsid ca protein is one of the least conserved regions encoded in the genome surprisingly the three dimensional structures of the ca from different genera exhibit  helical structural features that are highly conserved the n terminal residues of the human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  and rous sarcoma virus rsv capsid proteins form a  hairpin to determine if this feature is conserved in the retroviral family we cloned expressed purified and solved the structure of a n terminal   amino acid fragment ca   from the human t cell leukemia virus type  htlv i using high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy the ca  fragment contains an n terminal  hairpin and a central coiled coil like structure composed of six  helices the n terminal pro residue contacts asp  in the helical cluster through a salt bridge thus the  hairpin is conserved and the helical cluster is structurally similar to other retroviral ca domains however although the same asp residue defines the orientation of the hairpin in both the htlv  and hiv  ca proteins the htlv i hairpin is oriented away rather than towards the helical core significant differences were also detected in the spatial orientation and helical content of the long centrally located loop connecting the helices in the core it has been proposed that the salt bridge allows the formation of a ca ca interface that is important for the assembly of the conical cores that are characteristic of hiv  as htlv i forms spherical cores the salt bridge feature is apparently not conserved for this function although its role in determining the orientation of the  hairpin may be critical along with the central loop comparison of three dimensional structures is expected to elucidate the relationships between the retroviral capsid protein structure and its function
