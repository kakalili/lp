travel depth a new shape descriptor for macromolecules application to ligand binding
depth is a term frequently applied to the shape and surface of macromolecules describing for example the grooves in dna the shape of an enzyme active site or the binding site for a small molecule in a protein yet depth is a difficult property to define rigorously in a macromolecule and few computational tools exist to quantify this notion to visualize it or analyze the results we present our notion of travel depth simply put the physical distance a solvent molecule would have to travel from a surface point to a suitably defined reference surface to define the reference surface we use the limiting form of the molecular surface with increasing probe size the convex hull we then present a fast robust approximation algorithm to compute travel depth to every surface point the travel depth is useful because it works for pockets of any size and complexity it also works for two interesting special cases first it works on the grooves in dna which are unbounded in one direction second it works on the case of tunnels that is pockets that have no  bottom   but go through the entire macromolecule our algorithm makes it straightforward to quantify discussions of depth when analyzing structures high throughput analysis of macromolecule depth is also enabled by our algorithm this is demonstrated by analyzing a database of protein small molecule binding pockets and the distribution of bound magnesium ions in rna structures these analyses show significant but subtle effects of depth on ligand binding localization and strength
