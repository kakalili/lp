crystal structure of the human trna m a  methyltransferase  trna lys complex refolding of substrate trna allows access to the methylation target
human trna lys is the primer for reverse transcription of hiv the   end is complementary to the primer binding site on hiv rna the complementarity ends at the  th base a  which in trna lys is modified to remove watson  crick pairing motivated to test the role of the modification in terminating the primer binding sequence and thus limiting run on transcription we asked how the modification of rna could be accomplished trna m a  methyltransferase m a  mtase methylates n of a  which is buried in the t c loop of trna from cofactor s adenosyl l methionine this conserved trna modification is essential for stability of initiator trna in saccharomyces cerevisiae reported here three structures of human trna m a  mtase in complex with human trna lys and the product s adenosyl l homocysteine show a dimer of heterodimers in which each heterodimer comprises a catalytic chain trm  and a homologous but noncatalytic chain trm  repurposed as a trna binding subunit that acts in trans trnas bind across the dimer interface such that trm from the opposing heterodimer brings a  into the active site of trm  t loop and d loop are splayed apart showing how a  normally buried in trna becomes accessible for modification this result has broad impact on our understanding of the mechanisms of modifying internal sites in folded trna the structures serve as templates for design of inhibitors that could be used to test trna m a  mtase s impact on retroviral priming and transcription
