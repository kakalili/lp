crystal structure of a non canonical high affinity peptide complexed with mhc class i a novel use of alternative anchors
the crystal structure of a non standard peptide yea  in complex with h kb at    resolution demonstrates how yea peptide can bind with surprisingly high affinity through insertion of alternative long non canonical anchors into the b and e pockets the use of  alternative pockets  represents a new mode of high affinity peptide binding that should be considered when predicting peptide epitopes for mhc class i these novel interactions encountered in this non canonical high affinity peptide  mhc complex should help predict additional binding peptides from primary protein sequences and aid in the design of alternative approaches for peptide based vaccines
