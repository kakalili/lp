the internal head protein gp  controls dna ejection from the bacteriophage t virion edited by m gottesman
a wild type t virion ejects about   bp of the  kb genome into the bacterial cell by a transcription independent process internalization of the remainder of the genome normally requires transcription inhibition of transcription independent dna translocation beyond the leading   bp is not absolute but the time taken by a population of phage genomes in overcoming the block averages about  minutes at   c there are additional blocks to transcription independent translocation and less than   of infecting dna molecules completely penetrate the cell cytoplasm after four hours of infection mutant virions containing an altered gene  protein either prevent the blocks to transcription independent dna translocation or effect rapid release from blocking sites and allow the entire phage dna molecule to enter the cell at a constant rate of about  bp per second this rate is likely the same at which the leading   bp is ejected into the cell from a wild type virion all mutations fall into two clusters contained within   bp of the  kb gene   suggesting that a   residue segment of gp  controls dna ejection from the phage particle we suggest that this segment of gp  acts as a clamp to prevent transcription independent dna translocation
