We describe a method based on Rosetta structure refinement for generating high-resolution, all-atom protein models from electron cryomicroscopy density maps. A local measure of the fit of a model to the density is used to directly guide structure refinement and to identify regions incompatible with the density that are then targeted for extensive rebuilding. Over a range of test cases using both simulated and experimentally generated data, the method consistently increases the accuracy of starting models generated either by comparative modeling or by hand-tracing the density. The method can achieve near-atomic resolution starting from density maps at 4–6 Å resolution.
