the crystallographic structure of brome mosaic virus edited by i a wilson
the structure of brome mosaic virus bmv  the type member of the bromoviridae family has been determined from a single rhombohedral crystal by x ray diffraction and refined to an r value of    for data in the range        the structure which represents the native compact form at ph   in the presence of   m mg  was solved by molecular replacement using the model of cowpea chlorotic mottle virus ccmv  which bmv closely resembles the bmv model contains amino acid residues     for the pentameric capsid a subunits and residues     and     for the b and c subunits respectively which compose the hexameric capsomeres in the model there are two mg ions and one molecule of polyethylene glycol peg  the first  amino acid residues of the c subunit are modeled as polyalanine the coat protein has the canonical  jellyroll    barrel topology with extended amino terminal polypeptides as seen in other icosahedral plant viruses mass spectrometry shows that in native bmv virions a significant fraction of the amino terminal peptides are apparently cleaved no recognizable nucleic acid residue is visible in the electron density maps except at low resolution where it appears to exhibit a layered arrangement in the virion interior it is juxtaposed closely with the interior surface of the capsid but does not interpenetrate the protein subunits forming hexameric capsomeres and particularly dimers appear to interact extensively but the subunits otherwise contact one another sparsely about the  fold and quasi  fold axes thus the virion appears to be an assembly of loosely associated hexameric capsomeres which may be the basis for the swelling and dissociation that occurs at neutral ph and elevated salt concentration a mg ion is observed to lie exactly on the quasi  fold axis and is closely coordinated by side chains of three quasi symmetry related residues glutamates   with possible participation of side chains from threonines   and asparagines   a presumptive mg  is also present on the  fold axis where there is a concentration of negatively charged side chains but the precise coordination is unclear in both cases these cations appear to be essential for maintenance of virion stability density that is contiguous with the viral interior is present on the  fold axis at the center of the hexameric capsomere where there is a pore of about   diameter the density cannot be attributed to cations and it was modeled as a peg molecule
