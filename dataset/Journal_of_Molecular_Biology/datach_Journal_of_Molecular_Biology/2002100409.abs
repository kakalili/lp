x ray crystal structure of the c d fragment of human complement component c
c fulfills a vital role in the propagation of the classical and lectin pathways of the complement system although there are no reports to date of a c functional activity that is mediated solely by the c d region evidence clearly points to it having a vital role in a number of the properties of native c and its major activation fragment c b contained within the c d region are the thioester forming residues the four isotype specific residues controlling the c a c b transacylation preferences a binding site for nascent c b important in assembling the classical pathway c convertase and determinants for the chido rodgers ch rg blood group antigens in view of its functional importance we undertook to determine the three dimensional structure of c d by x ray crystallography here we report the    resolution structure of c ad the c d fragment derived from the human c a isotype although the    sequence identity between c ad and the corresponding fragment of c might be expected to establish a general fold similarity between the two molecules c ad in fact displays a fold that is essentially superimposable on the structure of c d by contrast the electrostatic characteristics of the various faces of the c ad molecule show marked differences from the corresponding faces of c d likely reflecting the differences in function between c and c  residues previously predicted to form the major ch rg epitopes were proximately located and accessible on the concave surface of c ad in addition to providing further insights on the current models for the covalent binding reaction the c ad structure allows one to rationalize why c d is not a ligand for complement receptor  finally the structure allows for the visualization of the face of the molecule containing the binding site for c b utilized in the assembly of classical pathway c convertase
