torque  speed relationships of na driven chimeric flagellar motors in escherichia coli
the bacterial flagellar motor is a rotary motor in the cell envelope of bacteria that couples ion flow across the cytoplasmic membrane to torque generation by independent stators anchored to the cell wall the recent observation of stepwise rotation of a na driven chimeric motor in escherichia coli promises to reveal the mechanism of the motor in unprecedented detail we measured torque  speed relationships of this chimeric motor using back focal plane interferometry of polystyrene beads attached to flagellar filaments in the presence of high sodium motive force   mm na  with full expression of stator proteins the torque  speed curve had the same shape as those of wild type e coli and vibrio alginolyticus motors the torque is approximately constant at     pn nm from stall up to a  knee  speed of     hz and then falls linearly with speed extrapolating to zero torque at     hz motors containing one to five stators generated     pn nm per stator at speeds up to     hz stator the knee speed in  and  stator motors is not significantly slower than in the fully induced motor this is consistent with the hypothesis that the absolute torque depends on stator number but the speed dependence does not in motors with point mutations in either of two critical conserved charged residues in the cytoplasmic domain of poma r a and r  e the zero torque speed was reduced to     hz the torque at low speed was unchanged by mutation r a but was reduced to     pn nm by r  e these results interpreted using a simple kinetic model indicate that the basic mechanism of torque generation is the same regardless of stator type and coupling ion and that the electrostatic interaction between stator and rotor proteins is related to the torque  speed relationship
