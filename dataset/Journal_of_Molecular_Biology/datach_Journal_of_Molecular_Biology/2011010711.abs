crystal structures of penicillin binding protein  from pseudomonas aeruginosa comparison of native and antibiotic bound forms
we report the first crystal structures of a penicillin binding protein pbp  pbp  from pseudomonas aeruginosa in native form and covalently linked to two important  lactam antibiotics carbenicillin and ceftazidime overall the structures of apo and acyl complexes are very similar however variations in the orientation of the amino terminal membrane proximal domain relative to that of the carboxy terminal transpeptidase domain indicate interdomain flexibility binding of either carbenicillin or ceftazidime to purified pbp increases the thermostability of the enzyme significantly and is associated with local conformational changes which lead to a narrowing of the substrate binding cleft the orientations of the two  lactams in the active site and the key interactions formed between the ligands and pbp are similar despite differences in the two drugs indicating a degree of flexibility in the binding site the conserved binding mode of  lactam based inhibitors appears to extend to other pbps as suggested by a comparison of the pbp ceftazidime complex and the escherichia coli pbp b ceftoxamine complex since p aeruginosa is an important human pathogen the structural data reveal the mode of action of the frontline antibiotic ceftazidime at the molecular level improved drugs to combat infections by p aeruginosa and related gram negative bacteria are sought and our study provides templates to assist that process and allows us to discuss new ways of inhibiting pbps
