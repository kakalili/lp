crystal structure of the bifunctional dihydroneopterin aldolase  hydroxymethyl   dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase from streptococcus pneumoniae
the enzymes dihydroneopterin aldolase dhna and  hydroxymethyl   dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase hppk catalyse two consecutive steps in the biosynthesis of folic acid neither of these enzymes has a counterpart in mammals and they have therefore been suggested as ideal targets for antimicrobial drugs some of the enzymes within the folate pathway can occur as bi or trifunctional complexes in bacteria and parasites but the way in which bifunctional dhna hppk enzymes are assembled is unclear here we report the determination of the structure at     resolution of the dhna hppk suld bifunctional enzyme complex from the respiratory pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae in the crystal dhna is assembled as a core octamer with   point group symmetry although the enzyme is active as a tetramer in solution individual hppk monomers are arranged at the ends of the dhna octamer making relatively few contacts with the dhna domain but more extensive interactions with adjacent hppk domains as a result the structure forms an elongated cylinder with the hppk domains forming two tetramers at each end the active sites of both enzymes face outward and there is no clear channel between them that could be used for channelling substrates the hppk  hppk interface accounts for about one third of the total area between adjacent monomers in suld and has levels of surface complementarity comparable to that of the dhna  dhna interfaces there is no  linker  polypeptide between dhna and hppk reducing the conformational flexibility of the hppk domain relative to the dhna domain the implications for the organisation of bi and trifunctional enzyme complexes within the folate biosynthesis pathway are discussed
