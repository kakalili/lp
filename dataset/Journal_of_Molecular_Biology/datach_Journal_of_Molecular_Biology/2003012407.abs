repositioning about the dimer interface of the transcription regulator cooa a major signal transduction pathway between the effector and dna binding domains
activation of the homodimeric transcriptional regulator cooa depends on the coupling of co binding at an effector domain heme with the allosteric repositioning of the dna binding domain f helix that promotes specific dna interaction by analogy to the homologous camp receptor protein crp  it has been proposed that effector binding elicits subunit reorientation about their coiled coil c helix interface and that this effector domain reorientation stabilizes the active position of the dna binding domains here we describe experiments in which effector independent  cooa    variants were selected following randomization of a six residue portion of the c helix dimerization domain subsequent activity analyses both in vivo and in vitro were consistent with a model wherein improved c helix  leucine zipper  interactions modestly shifted the regulator population equilibrium towards the active conformation although full activation remained co dependent however in addition to the improved leucine zipper maximal cooa  activity required additional c helix changes which in a wt background decreased normal co dependent dna binding   fold this seemingly paradoxical combination suggested that maximal cooa  activity depended both on the improved coiled coil interactions and the decoupling of the signal pathway within the effector domain both types of c helix changes indicate that its repositioning is crucial for the allosteric shift in the inactive active equilibrium of the dna binding domain
