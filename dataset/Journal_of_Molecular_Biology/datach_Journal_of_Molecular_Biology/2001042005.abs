the solution structure of bacteriophage  protein w a small morphogenetic protein possessing a novel fold edited by p e wright
protein w gpw from bacteriophage  is required for the stabilization of dna within the phage head and for attachment of tails onto the head during morphogenesis although comprised of only  residues it likely interacts with at least two other proteins in the mature phage and with dna thus gpw is an intriguing subject for detailed structural studies we have determined its solution structure using nmr spectroscopy and have found it to possesses a novel fold consisting of two  helices and a single two stranded  sheet arranged around a well packed hydrophobic core the  c terminal residues of gpw which are essential for function are unstructured in solution
