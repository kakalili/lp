functionally important residues in the peptidyl prolyl isomerase pin revealed by unigenic evolution
pin is a phosphorylation dependent member of the parvulin family of peptidyl prolyl isomerases exhibiting functional conservation between yeast and man to perform an unbiased analysis of the regions of pin essential for its functions we generated libraries of randomly mutated forms of the human pin cdna and identified functional pin alleles by their ability to complement the pin homolog ess in saccharomyces cerevisiae we isolated an extensive collection of functional mutant pin clones harboring a total of   amino acid substitutions surprisingly many residues previously thought to be critical in pin were found to be altered in this collection of functional mutants in fact only  residues were completely conserved in these mutants and in pin sequences from other eukaryotic organisms with only two of these conserved residues located within the ww domain of pin  examination of invariant residues provided new insights regarding a phosphate binding loop that distinguishes a phosphorylation dependent peptidyl prolyl isomerase such as pin from other parvulins in addition these studies led to an investigation of residues involved in catalysis including c  that was previously implicated as the catalytic nucleophile we demonstrate that substitution of c  with d does not compromise pin function in vivo nor does this substitution abolish catalytic activity in purified recombinant pin  these findings are consistent with the prospect that the function of residue   may not be that of a nucleophile thus raising questions about the model of nucleophilic catalysis accordingly an alternative catalytic mechanism for pin is postulated
