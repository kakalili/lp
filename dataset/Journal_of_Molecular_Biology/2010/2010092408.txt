Key elements of β-structure folding include hydrophobic core collapse, turn formation, and assembly of backbone hydrogen bonds. In the present folding simulations of several β-hairpins and β-sheets (peptide 1, protein G B1 domain peptide, TRPZIP2, TRPZIP4, 20mer, and 20merDP6D), the folding free-energy landscape as a function of several reaction coordinates corresponding to the three key elements indicates apparent dependence on turn stability and side-chain hydrophobicity, which demonstrates different folding mechanisms of similar β-structures of varied sequences. Turn stability is found to be the key factor in determining the formation order of the three structural elements in the folding of β-structures. Moreover, turn stability and side-chain hydrophobicity both affect the stability of backbone hydrogen bonds. The three-stranded β-sheets fold through a three-state transition in which the formation of one hairpin always takes precedence over the other. The different stabilities of two anti-parallel hairpins in each three-stranded β-sheet are shown to correlate well with the different levels of their hydrophobic interactions.
