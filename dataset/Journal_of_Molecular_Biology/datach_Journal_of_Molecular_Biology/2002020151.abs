crystal structure reveals basis for the inhibitor resistance of human brain trypsin edited by r huber
severe neurodegradative brain diseases like alzheimer are tightly linked with proteolytic activity in the human brain proteinases expressed in the brain such as human trypsin iv are likely to be involved in the pathomechanism of these diseases the observation of amyloid formed in the brain of transgenic mice expressing human trypsin iv supports this hypothesis human trypsin iv is also resistant towards all studied naturally occurring polypeptide inhibitors it has been postulated that the substitution of gly  to arginine is responsible for this inhibitor resistance here we report the x ray structure of human trypsin iv in complex with the inhibitor benzamidine at    resolution the overall fold of human trypsin iv is similar to human trypsin i with a root mean square deviation of only    for all c  positions the crystal structure reveals the orientation of the side chain of arg   which occupies an extended conformation and fills the s   subsite an analysis of surface electrostatic potentials shows an unusually strong clustering of positive charges around the primary specificity pocket to which the side chain of arg  also contributes these unique features of the crystal structure provide a structural basis for the enhanced inhibitor resistance and enhanced substrate restriction of human trypsin iv
