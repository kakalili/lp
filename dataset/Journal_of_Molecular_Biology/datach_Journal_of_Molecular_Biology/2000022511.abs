ligand triggered stabilization of vitamin d receptor retinoid x receptor heterodimer conformations on dr type response elements edited by g von heijne
nuclear receptors integrate an incoming signal in the form of a nuclear hormone by undergoing a conformational change that results via co activator proteins in an activation of the basal transcriptional machinery the vitamin d receptor is the nuclear receptor for    dihydroxy vitamin d     oh d  and is known to function as a heterodimer with the retinoid x receptor on dr type    oh d response elements here it could be demonstrated that dr type response elements are at least as effective as dr type    oh d response elements gel shift clipping analysis showed that vitamin d receptor retinoid x receptor heterodimers form in response to    oh d and retinoid x receptor ligands the pan agonist  cis retinoic acid  cra and the retinoid x receptor selective retinoid cd   different conformations on the dr type element of the rat pit  gene interestingly on this response element the heterodimeric complexes of retinoid x receptor with the thyroid hormone receptor the retinoic acid receptor and the benzoate ester receptor also displayed characteristic individual ligand dependent complex formation on the level of complex formation utilizing dna affinity and functional assays only vitamin d receptor retinoid x receptor heterodimers showed a synergistic interaction of both ligands however the sensitivity of vitamin d receptor retinoid x receptor heterodimers to    oh d was found to be much higher than to retinoid x receptor ligands taken together this study demonstrates a unique interaction potential of vitamin d receptor and retinoid x receptor but also establishes dr type response elements as multi functional dna binding sites with a potential to integrate various hormone signalling pathways
