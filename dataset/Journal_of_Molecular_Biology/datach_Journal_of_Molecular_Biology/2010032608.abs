structural basis for asymmetric association of the  pix coiled coil and shank pdz
pix p  activated kinase interacting exchange factor and shank prosap protein form a complex acting as a protein scaffold that integrates signaling pathways and regulates postsynaptic structure complex formation is mediated by the c terminal pdz binding motif of  pix and the shank pdz domain the coiled coil cc domain upstream of the pdz binding motif allows multimerization of  pix which is important for its physiological functions we have solved the crystal structure of the  pix cc  shank pdz complex and determined the stoichiometry of complex formation the  pix cc forms a    long parallel cc trimer despite the fact that the  pix cc exposes three pdz binding motifs in the c termini the  pix trimer associates with a single shank pdz one of the c terminal ends of the cc forms an extensive  sheet interaction with the shank pdz while the other two ends are not involved in ligand binding and form random coils the two c terminal ends of  pix have significantly lower affinity than the first pdz binding motif due to the steric hindrance in the c terminal tails which results in binding of a single pdz domain to the  pix trimer the structure shows canonical class i pdz binding with a  sheet interaction extending to position   of  pix the  b   c loop of shank pdz undergoes a conformational change upon ligand binding to form the  sheet interaction and to accommodate the bulky side chain of trp    this structural study provides a clear picture of the molecular recognition of the pdz ligand and the asymmetric association of  pix cc and shank pdz
