helix stabilized fv hsfv antibody fragments substituting the constant domains of a fab fragment for a heterodimeric coiled coil domain edited by i a wilson
antibody fv fragments would in principle be useful for a variety of biotechnological applications because of their small size and the possibility to produce them in relatively large amounts in recombinant form however their limited stability is a drawback to solve this problem both domains are usually fused via a peptide linker to form a single chain fv scfv fragment but in some cases this leads to a dimerization we present an alternative format for stabilizing antibody fv fragments the ch and cl domain of the fab fragment were replaced with a heterodimeric coiled coil winzip a b  which had previously been selected using a protein fragment complementation assay in escherichia coli this new antibody format was termed helix stabilized fv fragment hsfv  and was compared to the corresponding fv fab and single chain fv format bacterial growth and expression of the hsfv was significantly improved compared to the fab fragment the hsfv fragment formed a heterodimer of heavy and light chain with the expected molecular mass also under conditions where the scfv fragment was predominantly dimeric the hsfv fragment was significantly more stable than the fv fragment and nearly as stable as the scfv fragment under the conditions used   nm protein concentration  thus the format of a helix stabilized fv hsfv fragment can be a useful alternative to existing recombinant antibody formats especially in cases where poor expression of fab fragments or multimerization of scfv fragments is a problem
