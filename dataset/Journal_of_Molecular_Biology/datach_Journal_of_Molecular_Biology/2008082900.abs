millisecond time resolved changes occurring in ca  regulated myosin filaments upon relaxation
contraction of many muscles is activated in part by the binding of ca  to or phosphorylation of the myosin heads on the surface of the thick filaments in relaxed muscle the myosin heads are helically ordered and undergo minimal interaction with actin on ca  binding or phosphorylation the head array becomes disordered reflecting breakage of the head  head and other interactions that underlie the ordered structure loosening of the heads from the filament surface enables them to interact with actin filaments bringing about contraction on relaxation the heads return to their ordered positions on the filament backbone in scallop striated adductor muscle the disordering that takes place on ca  binding occurs on the millisecond time scale suggesting that it is a key element of muscle activation here we have studied the reverse process using time resolved negative staining electron microscopy we show that the rate of reordering on removal of ca  also occurs on the same physiological time scale direct observation of images together with analysis of their fourier transforms shows that activated heads regain their axial ordering within   ms and become ordered in their final helical positions within  ms this rapid reordering suggests that reformation of the ordered structure and the head  head and other interactions that underlie it is a critical element of the relaxation process
