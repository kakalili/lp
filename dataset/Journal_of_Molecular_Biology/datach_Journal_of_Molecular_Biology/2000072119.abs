surface tongue and groove contours on lens mip facilitate cell to cell adherence
the lens major intrinsic protein mip aqp  is known to function as a water and solute channel however mip has also been reported to occur in close membrane contacts between lens fiber cells indicating that it has adhesive properties in addition to its channel function using atomic force and cryo electron microscopy we document that crystalline sheets reconstituted from purified ovine lens mip mostly consisted of two layers mip lattices in the apposing membranes were in precise register and determination of the membrane sidedness demonstrated that mip molecules bound to each other via their extracellular surfaces the surface structure of the latter was resolved to   nm and revealed two protruding domains providing a tight  tongue and groove  fit between apposing mip molecules cryo electron crystallography produced a projection map at   nm resolution with a mirror symmetry axis at   to the lattice which was consistent with the double layered nature of the reconstituted sheets these data strongly suggest an adhesive function of mip and strengthen the view that mip serves dual roles in the lens
