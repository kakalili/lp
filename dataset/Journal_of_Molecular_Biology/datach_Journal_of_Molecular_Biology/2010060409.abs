assignment strategies for large proteins by magic angle spinning nmr the  kda disulfide bond forming enzyme dsba
we present strategies for chemical shift assignments of large proteins by magic angle spinning solid state nmr using the  kda disulfide bond forming enzyme dsba as prototype previous studies have demonstrated that complete de novo assignments are possible for proteins up to    kda and partial assignments have been performed for several larger proteins here we show that combinations of isotopic labeling strategies high field correlation spectroscopy and three dimensional  d and four dimensional  d backbone correlation experiments yield highly confident assignments for more than   of backbone resonances in dsba samples were prepared as nanocrystalline precipitates by a dialysis procedure resulting in heterogeneous linewidths below   ppm thus high magnetic fields selective decoupling pulse sequences and sparse isotopic labeling all improved spectral resolution assignments by amino acid type were facilitated by particular combinations of pulse sequences and isotopic labeling for example transferred echo double resonance experiments enhanced sensitivity for pro and gly residues    c glycerol labeling clarified val ile and leu assignments in phase anti phase correlation spectra enabled interpretation of otherwise crowded glx asx side chain regions and d ncacx experiments on   c glycerol samples provided unique sets of aromatic phe tyr and trp correlations together with high sensitivity cancoca d experiments and cancocx d experiments unambiguous backbone walks could be performed throughout the majority of the sequence at   residues dsba represents the largest monomeric unit for which essentially complete solid state nmr assignments have so far been achieved these results will facilitate studies of nanocrystalline dsba structure and dynamics and will enable analysis of its  kda covalent complex with the membrane protein dsbb for which we demonstrate a high resolution two dimensional  c   c spectrum
