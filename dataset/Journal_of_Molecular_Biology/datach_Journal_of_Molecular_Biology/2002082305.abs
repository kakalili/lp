the unfolding of oxidized c type cytochromes the instructive case of bacillus pasteurii
the reversible unfolding of oxidized bacillus pasteurii cytochrome c  by guanidinium chloride under equilibrium conditions has been monitored by nmr and optical spectroscopy the results obtained indicate that unfolding takes place through a mechanism involving the detachment from heme iron coordination of the sulfur of the met  axial ligand and yielding either a high spin hs or a low spin ls  species depending on the ph value in the ls form the met  is replaced by another protein ligand possibly lys the ligand exchange reaction does not reach completion until the protein backbone reaches a largely unfolded state as monitored through h   n nmr experiments thus demonstrating that there is a significant correlation between formation of the fe  s bond and native structure stability  h h exchange data however show that helix   the c terminal region of helix   and helix   maintain low exchangeability of the amide protons in the ls form this finding most likely implies that these regions maintain some ordered non covalent structure in which the amide moieties are involved in h bonds finally a folding mechanism is proposed and discussed in terms of analogies and differences with the larger mitochondrial cytochrome c proteins it is concluded that the thermodynamic stability of the region around the metal cofactor is determined by the chemical nature of the residues around the axial methionine residue
