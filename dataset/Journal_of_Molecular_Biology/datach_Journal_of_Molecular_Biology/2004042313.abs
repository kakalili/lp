high resolution crystal structures of hiv  protease with a potent non peptide inhibitor uic    active against multi drug resistant clinical strains
the compound uic    tmc   is a second generation hiv protease inhibitor with improved pharmacokinetics that is chemically related to the clinical inhibitor amprenavir uic    is a broad spectrum potent inhibitor active against hiv  clinical isolates with minimal cytotoxicity we have determined the high resolution crystal structures of uic    in complexes with wild type hiv  protease pr and mutant proteases prv a and pri v that are common in drug resistant hiv the structures were refined at resolutions of        the crystal structures of pr and pri v with uic    ternary complexes show that the inhibitor binds to the protease in two overlapping positions while the prv a complex had one ordered inhibitor in all three structures uic    forms hydrogen bonds with the conserved main chain atoms of asp  and asp  of the protease these interactions are proposed to be critical for the potency of this compound against hiv isolates that are resistant to multiple protease inhibitors other small differences were observed in the interactions of the mutants with uic    as compared to pr prv a showed differences in the position of the main chain atoms of residue  compared to pr structure that better accommodated the inhibitor finally the    resolution structure of prv a with uic    showed an unusual distribution of electron density for the catalytic aspartate residues which is discussed in relation to the reaction mechanism
