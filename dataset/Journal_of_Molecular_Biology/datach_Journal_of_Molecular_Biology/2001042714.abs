nmr characterization of clustered bistrand abasic site lesions effect of orientation on their solution structure edited by i tinoco
a unique characteristic of ionizing radiation and radiomimetic anticancer drugs is the induction of clustered damage two or more dna lesions oxidized bases abasic sites or strand breaks occurring in the same or different strands of the dna molecule within a single turn of the helix in spite of arising at a lower frequency than single lesions clustered dna damage represents an exotic challenge to the repair systems present in the cells and in some cases these lesions may escape detection and or processing to understand the structural properties of clustered dna lesions we have prepared two oligodeoxynucleotide duplexes containing adjacent tetrahydrofuran residues abasic site analogues  positioned one in each strand of the duplex in a   or   orientation and determined their solution structure by nmr spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations the nmr data indicate that both duplex structures are right handed helices of high similarity outside the clustered damage site the thermal stability of the duplexes is severely reduced by the presence of the abasic residues especially in a   orientation where the melting temperature is  c lower the structures show remarkable differences at the lesion site where the extrahelical location of the tetrahydrofuran residues in the ap    staggered duplex contrasts with their smooth alignment along the sugar phosphate backbone in the ap    staggered duplex
