crystal structure and evolution of a prokaryotic glucoamylase
the first crystal structures of a two domain prokaryotic glucoamylase were determined to high resolution from the clostridial species thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum with and without acarbose the n terminal domain has  antiparallel strands arranged in  sheets of a super  sandwich the c terminal domain is an     barrel lacking the peripheral subdomain of eukaryotic glucoamylases interdomain contacts are common to all prokaryotic family gh  proteins domains similar to those of prokaryotic glucoamylases in maltose phosphorylases family gh  and glycoaminoglycan lyases family pl  suggest evolution from a common ancestor eukaryotic glucoamylases may have evolved from prokaryotic glucoamylases by the substitution of the n terminal domain with the peripheral subdomain and by the addition of a starch binding domain
