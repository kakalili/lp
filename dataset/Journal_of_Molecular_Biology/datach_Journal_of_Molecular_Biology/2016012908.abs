quantitative selection analysis of bacteriophage  cbk susceptibility in caulobacter crescentus
classical molecular genetics uses stringent selective conditions to identify mutants with distinct phenotypic responses mutations giving rise to less pronounced phenotypes are often missed however to gain systems level insights into complex genetic interaction networks requires genome wide assignment of quantitative phenotypic traits in this paper we present a quantitative selection approach coupled with transposon sequencing qs tnseq to globally identify the cellular components that orchestrate susceptibility of the cell cycle model bacterium caulobacter crescentus toward bacteriophage  cbk infection we found that   genes representing    of the caulobacter genome exhibit significant accumulation of transposon insertions upon  cbk selection more than   thereof consist of new factors not previously associated with phage  cbk susceptibility using hierarchical clustering of dose dependent tnseq datasets we grouped these genes into functional modules that correlate with different stages of the  cbk infection process we assign  cbk susceptibility to eight new genes that represent novel components of the pilus secretion machinery further we demonstrate that from  motility genes only seven genes encoding structural and regulatory components of the flagellar hook increase phage resistance when disrupted by transposons suggesting a link between flagellar hook assembly and pili biogenesis in addition we observe high recovery of tn insertions within regulatory sequences of the genes encoding the essential nadh ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex indicating that intact proton motive force is crucial for effective phage propagation in sum qs tnseq is broadly applicable to perform quantitative and genome wide systems genetics analysis of complex phenotypic traits
