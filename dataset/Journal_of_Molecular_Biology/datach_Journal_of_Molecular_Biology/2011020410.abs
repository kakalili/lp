visualizing atp dependent rna translocation by the ns helicase from hcv
the structural mechanism by which nonstructural protein  ns  from the hepatitis c virus hcv translocates along rna is currently unknown hcv ns is an atp dependent motor protein essential for viral replication and a member of the superfamily  helicases crystallographic analysis using a labeled rna oligonucleotide allowed us to unambiguously track the positional changes of rna bound to full length hcv ns during two discrete steps of the atp hydrolytic cycle the crystal structures of hcv ns  ns bound to bromine labeled rna and a tertiary complex of ns bound to labeled rna and a non hydrolyzable atp analog provide a direct view of how large domain movements resulting from atp binding and hydrolysis allow the enzyme to translocate along the phosphodiester backbone while directional translocation of hcv ns by a single base pair per atp hydrolyzed is observed the   end of the rna does not shift register with respect to a conserved tryptophan residue supporting a  spring loading  mechanism that leads to larger steps by the enzyme as it moves along a nucleic acid substrate
