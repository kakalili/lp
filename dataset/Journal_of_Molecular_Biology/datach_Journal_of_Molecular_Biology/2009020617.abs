analysis of flavivirus ns methyltransferase cap binding
the flavivirus   o nucleoside n terminal rna methyltransferase mtase enzyme is responsible for methylating the viral rna cap structure to increase our understanding of the mechanism of viral rna cap binding we performed a detailed structural and biochemical characterization of the guanosine cap binding pocket of the dengue den and yellow fever yf virus mtase enzymes we solved an improved     resolution crystal structure of den mtase new     resolution crystal structures of the yf virus mtase domain in apo form and a new     structure in complex with guanosine triphosphate and rna cap analog our structures clarify the previously reported den mtase structure suggest novel protein  cap interactions and provide a detailed view of guanine specificity furthermore the structures of the den and yf proteins are essentially identical indicating a large degree of structural conservation amongst the flavivirus mtases guanosine triphosphate analog competition assays and mutagenesis analysis performed to analyze the biochemical characteristics of cap binding determined that the major interaction points are i guanine ring via     stacking with phe  n hydrogen interaction with the leu  backbone carbonyl via a water bridge and c amine interaction with leu  and leu  backbone carbonyls  ii ribose   hydroxyl interaction with lys  and asn  and iii   phosphate interactions with lys  and ser   based on our mutational and analog studies the guanine ring and  phosphate interactions provide most of the energy for cap binding while the combination of the water bridge between the guanine n and leu  carbonyl and the hydrogen bonds between the c amine and leu  leu  carbonyl groups provide for specific guanine recognition a detailed model of how the flavivirus mtase protein binds rna cap structures is presented
