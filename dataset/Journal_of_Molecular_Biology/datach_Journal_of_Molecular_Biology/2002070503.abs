decreased thermodynamic stability as a crucial factor for familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy
a single mutation in the wild type transthyretin wt ttr such as v m causes a familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy disease comparison of the three dimensional crystal structures of wt and v m does not tell much about the reason high pressure nmr revealed that at neutral ph both wt and v m exist as equilibrium between the native tetramer and the dissociated unfolded monomer the native tetramer is highly stable in wt  g   kj mol at   c ph    but the stability is significantly reduced in v m   g    kj mol  increasing the fraction of the unfolded monomer by a   fold significant reduction of thermodynamic stability of wt ttr by mutation could be a crucial factor for familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy
