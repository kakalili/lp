dna polymerase switching i replication factor c displaces dna polymerase  prior to pcna loading edited by j karn
an important not yet fully understood event in dna replication is the dna polymerase pol switch from pol  to pol   indirect evidence suggested that the clamp loader replication factor c rf c plays an important role since a replication competent protein complex containing pol   pol  and rf c could perform pol switching in the presence of proliferating cell nuclear antigen pcna  by using purified pol  primase pol   rf c pcna and rp a we show that  i rf c can inhibit pol  in the presence of atp prior to pcna loading  ii rf c decreases the affinity of pol  for the   oh primer ends  iii the inhibition of pol  by rf c is released upon pcna loading  iv atp hydrolysis is required for pcna loading and subsequent release of inhibition of pol   v under these conditions a switching from pol  primase to pol  is evident thus rf c appears to be critical for the pol  to pol  switching based on these results a model is proposed in which rf c induces the pol switching by sequestering the   oh end from pol  and subsequently recruiting pcna to dna
