structural and thermodynamic characterization of the interaction between two periplasmic treponema pallidum lipoproteins that are components of a tpr protein associated trap transporter tpat
tripartite atp independent periplasmic transporters trap ts are bacterial transport systems that have been implicated in the import of small molecules into the cytoplasm a newly discovered subfamily of trap ts tetratricopeptide repeat protein associated trap transporters tpats  has four components three are common to both trap ts and tpats the p component a ligand binding protein and a transmembrane symporter apparatus comprising the m and q components m and q are sometimes fused to form a single polypeptide  tpats are distinguished from trap ts by the presence of a unique protein called the  t component   in treponema pallidum this protein tatt is a water soluble trimer whose protomers are each perforated by a pore its respective p component tatpt interacts with the tatt in vitro and in vivo in this work we further characterized this interaction co crystal structures of two complexes between the two proteins confirm that up to three monomers of tatpt can bind to the tatt trimer a putative ligand binding cleft of tatpt aligns with the pore of tatt strongly suggesting ligand transfer between t and pt we used a combination of site directed mutagenesis and analytical ultracentrifugation to derive thermodynamic parameters for the interactions these observations confirm that the observed crystallographic interface is recapitulated in solution these results prompt a hypothesis of the molecular mechanism s of hydrophobic ligand transport by the tpats
