structural and kinetic analysis of pyrrolidine based inhibitors of the drug resistant ile val mutant of hiv  protease
human immunodeficiency virus hiv protease is a well established drug target in hiv chemotherapy however continuously increasing resistance towards approved drugs inevitably requires the development of new inhibitors preferably showing no susceptibility against resistant hiv protease strains recently symmetric pyrrolidine   bis n benzyl sulfonamides have been developed as a new class of hiv  protease inhibitors the most promising candidate exhibited a ki of   nm towards a wild type protease herein we report the influence of the active site mutations ile val and ile val on these inhibitors by structural and kinetic analysis although the ile val mutation leads to a significant decrease in affinity for all compounds in this series they retain or even show increased affinity towards the important ile val mutation by detailed analysis of the crystal structures of two representatives in complex with wild type and mutant proteases we were able to elucidate the structural basis of this phenomenon
