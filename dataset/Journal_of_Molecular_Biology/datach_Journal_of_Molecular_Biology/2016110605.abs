new insights into the phage genetic switch effects of bacteriophage lambda operator mutations on dna looping and regulation of pr pl and prm
one of the best understood systems in genetic regulatory biology is the so called  genetic switch  that determines the choice the phage encoded ci repressor binds cooperatively to tripartite operators ol and or in a defined pattern thus blocking the transcription at two lytic promoters pl and pr and auto regulating the promoter prm which directs ci synthesis by the prophage fine tuning of the maintenance of lysogeny is facilitated by interactions between ci dimers bound to or and ol through the formation of a loop by the intervening dna segment by using a purified in vitro transcription system we have genetically dissected the roles of individual operator sites in the formation of the dna loop and thus have gained several new and unexpected insights into the system first although both or and ol are tripartite the presence of only a single active ci binding site in one of the two operators is sufficient for dna loop formation second in pl unlike in pr the promoter distal operator site ol  is sufficient to directly repress pl third dna looping mediated by the formation of ci octamers arising through the interaction of pairs of dimers bound to adjacent operator sites in or and ol does not require or and ol to be aligned  in register   that is ci bound to  out of register  sub operators for example ol ol and or or  can also mediate loop formation finally based on an examination of the mechanism of activation of prm when only or or or are wild type we hypothesize that rna polymerase bound at pr interferes with dna loop formation thus the formation of dna loops involves potential interactions between proteins bound at numerous cis acting sites which therefore very subtly contribute to the regulation of the  switch
