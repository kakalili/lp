the crystal structure of zebrafish s  z implications for calcium promoted s  protein oligomerisation
the s  family with about  members in humans is composed of ef hand calcium regulated proteins and is linked to a range of serious human diseases including cancer and autoimmune and neurological disorders the oldest s  family members are found in teleosts bony fish  the zebrafish danio rerio was suggested as a promising model system for in vivo studies on s  family functions and we chose to investigate zebrafish s  z as the closest homologue of the metastasis promoting human s  a  here we report the first crystal structure of an s  protein from this organism the calcium bound state of s  z to     resolution crystal packing suggests higher order oligomerisation of s  z dimers with a tetramerisation interface very similar to but even more extensive than that reported for s  a  the interactions are primarily through the c terminal  iv helices from adjacent dimers in an antiparallel orientation structural comparisons between known s  multimeric assemblies together with analysis of calcium driven changes to the dimerisation cores suggest a mechanism for calcium promoted oligomerisation of s  proteins
