diffusion of the restriction nuclease ecori along dna
many specific sequence dna binding proteins locate their target sequence by first binding to dna nonspecifically then by linearly diffusing or hopping along dna until either the protein dissociates from the dna or it finds the recognition sequence we have devised a method for measuring one dimensional diffusion along dna based on the ratio of the dissociation rate of protein from dna fragments containing one specific binding site to the dissociation rate from dna fragments containing two specific binding sites our extensive measurements of dissociation rates and specific  nonspecific relative binding constants of the restriction nuclease ecori enable us to determine the diffusion rate of nonspecifically bound protein along the dna by varying the distance between the two binding sites we confirm a linear diffusion mechanism the sliding rate is relatively insensitive to salt concentration and osmotic pressure indicating that the protein moves smoothly along the dna probably following the helical phosphate sugar backbone of dna we calculate a diffusion coefficient for ecori of     bp  s   ecori is able to diffuse     bp on average along the dna in  s this diffusion rate is about   fold slower than the diffusion of free protein in solution a factor of     can be accounted for by rotational friction resulting from following the helical path of the dna backbone two possibilities could account for the remaining activation energy salt bridges between the dna and the protein are transiently broken or the water structure at the protein  dna interface is disrupted as the two surfaces move past each other
