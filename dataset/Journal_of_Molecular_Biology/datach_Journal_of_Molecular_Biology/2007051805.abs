comprehensive analysis of distinctive polyketide and nonribosomal peptide structural motifs encoded in microbial genomes
we developed a highly accurate method to predict polyketide pk and nonribosomal peptide nrp structures encoded in microbial genomes pks nrps are polymers of carbonyl peptidyl chains synthesized by polyketide synthases pks and nonribosomal peptide synthetases nrps  we analyzed domain sequences corresponding to specific substrates and physical interactions between pkss nrpss in order to predict which substrates carbonyl peptidyl units are selected and assembled into highly ordered chemical structures the predicted pks nrps were represented as the sequences of carbonyl peptidyl units to extract the structural motifs efficiently we applied our method to   pkss nrpss and found   pks nrps we also collected   pks nrps whose chemical structures have been determined experimentally the structural sequences were compared using the smith  waterman algorithm and clustered into   clusters from the compound clusters we extracted  structural motifs that are significantly related with their bioactivities we used the structural motifs to infer functions of  novel pks nrps clusters produced by pseudomonas spp and burkholderia spp and found a putative virulence factor the integrative analysis of genomic and chemical information given here will provide a strategy to predict the chemical structures the biosynthetic pathways and the biological activities of pks nrps which is useful for the rational design of novel pks nrps
