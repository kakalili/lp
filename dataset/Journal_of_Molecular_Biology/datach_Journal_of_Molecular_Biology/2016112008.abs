an mcm  mutant defective in ssdna binding shows defects in dna replication initiation
mcm  is an essential protein that functions to initiate dna replication after the formation of the replication fork helicase in this manuscript we identified a budding yeast mcm  mutant mcm  m    that is defective in dna binding in vitro moreover this mcm  m   mutant does not stimulate the phosphorylation of mcm by dbf dependent kinase ddk in vitro when we expressed wild type levels of mcm  m   in budding yeast cells we observed a severe growth defect and a substantially decreased dna replication we also observed a substantially reduced replication protein a chromatin immunoprecipitation signal at origins of replication reduced levels of ddk phosphorylated mcm  and diminished go ichi ni and san gins association with mcm   in vivo mcm bob bypasses the growth defect conferred by ddk phosphodead mcm in budding yeast however the growth defect observed by expressing mcm  m   is not bypassed by the mcm bob mutation furthermore origin melting and gins association with mcm   are substantially decreased for cells expressing mcm  m   in the mcm bob background thus the origin melting and gins  mcm   interaction defects we observed for mcm  m   are not explained by decreased mcm phosphorylation by ddk since the defects persist in an mcm bob background these data suggest that dna binding by mcm  is essential for the initiation of dna replication
