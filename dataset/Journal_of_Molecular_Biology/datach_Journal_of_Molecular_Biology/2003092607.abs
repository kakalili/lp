folding kinetics of two state proteins effect of circularization permutation and crosslinks
protein folding kinetics has recently been probed by clever experiments using circular permutants and other topological mutations a circular permutant is created from a wild type protein by covalently linking together the chain ends and cleaving elsewhere in the chain an interesting puzzle is why circular permutation causes no apparent change in the folding mechanism of ci  but dramatic changes in the folding mechanisms of s and of an sh domain as determined by  value experiments here we use a computational model to predict the folding routes of topological variants based on a measure effective contact order of the chain entropy loss at each folding step the predictions are consistent with the experiments leading to insights into the folding routes and into the meaning of  values in general we find that  values do not always describe time sequences of folding events or positions along a single reaction coordinate rather   reflects only the degree of rate control for example the circular permutant p    of ci is predicted to reverse the time sequence of the formation of    relative to     without changing the diffuse  value distribution while the circular permutant p    of s switches the rate limiting step from the formation of    to     changing the  value distribution from diffuse to strongly polarized as a test of the model we propose mutations that should reverse these outcomes
