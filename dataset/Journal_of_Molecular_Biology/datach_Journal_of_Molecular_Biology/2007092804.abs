structural basis for polyproline recognition by the fe  ww domain
the neuronal protein fe  functions in brain development and amyloid precursor protein app signaling through its interaction with the mammalian enabled mena protein and app respectively the recognition of short polyproline sequences in mena by the fe  ww domain has a central role in axon guidance and neuronal positioning in the developing brain we have determined the crystal structures of the human fe  ww domain residues      in the apo form and bound to the peptides pppppplpp and pppppppppl which correspond to human mena residues      and      respectively the fe  ww domain contains two parallel ligand binding grooves xp formed by residues y  and w   and xp  formed by y  and w   both mena peptides adopt a polyproline helical ii conformation and bind to the ww domain in a forward n  c orientation through selection of the ppppp motif by the xp and xp grooves this mode of ligand recognition is strikingly similar to polyproline interaction with sh domains importantly comparison of the fe  ww structures in the apo and liganded forms shows that the xp groove is formed by an induced fit mechanism that involves movements of the w  and y  side chains upon ligand binding these structures elucidate the molecular determinants underlying polyproline ligand selection by the fe  ww domain and provide a framework for the design of small molecules that would interfere with fe  ww  ligand interaction and modulate neuronal development and app signaling
