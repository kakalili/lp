analysis of amino acids in the      loop of human immunodeficiency virus type  reverse transcriptase for their role in virus replication
the hiv  p  p  reverse transcriptase rt heterodimer interface comprises in part intermolecular interaction of the loop region between  strands  and       loop in the p  fingers subdomain with the p  palm subdomain in this study for the first time in the context of infectious hiv  particles we analyzed the contribution of amino acid residues s   i   n   n   t  and p   in the      loop for rt heterodimerization enzymatic activity and virus infectivity mutating asparagine   to alanine n  a reduced viral infectivity and enzyme activity dramatically the n  a mutation appeared to destabilize the rt heterodimer and render both the p  and p  subunits susceptible to aberrant cleavage by the viral protease subunit specific mutagenesis demonstrated that the presence of the n  a mutation in the p  subunit alone was sufficient to cause degradation of rt within the virus particle alanine mutation at other residues of the      loop did not affect either rt stability or virus infectivity significantly none of the      loop alanine mutations affected the sensitivity of virus to inhibition by nnrtis in the context of infectious virions our results indicate a critical role of the p  n  residue within the      loop for rt heterodimer stability and function these findings suggest the interface comprising n  in p  and interacting residues in p  as a possible target for rational drug design
