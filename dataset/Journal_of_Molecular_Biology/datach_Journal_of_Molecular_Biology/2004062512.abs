transport deficient pit phosphate transporters still modify cell surface oligomers structure in response to inorganic phosphate
pit is a member of the pit family of inorganic phosphate transporters and serves as a gamma retrovirus receptor in mammals pit contains two copies of the protein homology domain pd    which defines the pit family these domains are presumably in opposite topology with respect to the plasma membrane plane we have mutated a serine residue conserved in almost all of the   known pd    sequences to alanine in each pd    domain of human pit  expression in cho cells showed that phosphate uptake was affected severely in mutants whereas susceptibility to virus infection was conserved we reported previously that the inorganic phosphate concentration affects both phosphate transport mediated by pit and the conformation of cell surface pit oligomers cross linking experiments in transport incompetent pit mutants indicated that structural changes induced by phosphate starvation or supply occur independently of the whole transport cycle these results suggest that the structural reorganisation of cell surface pit occurred as a consequence of ion binding a model consistent with the possible involvement of cell surface pit oligomers in inorganic phosphate sensing
