Mycobacteriophage L5 is a temperate phage that forms lysogens in Mycobacterium smegmatis. These lysogens carry an integrated L5 prophage inserted at a specific chromosomal location and undergo subsequent excision during induction of lytic growth. Both the integrative and excisive site-specific recombination events are catalyzed by the phage-encoded tyrosine integrase (Int-L5) and require the host-encoded protein, mIHF. The directionality of these recombination events is determined by a second phage-encoded protein, Excise, the product of gene 36 (Xis-L5); integration occurs efficiently in the absence of Xis-L5 while excision is dependent upon it. We show here that Xis-L5 binds to attR DNA, introduces a DNA bend, and facilitates the formation of an intasome-R complex. This complex, which requires mIHF, Xis-L5 and Int-L5, readily recombines with a second intasome formed by Int-L5, mIHF and attL DNA (intasome-L) to generate the attP and attB products of excision. Xis-L5 also strongly inhibits Int-L5-mediated integrative recombination but does not prevent either the protein–DNA interactions that form the attP intasome (intasome-P) or the capture of attB, but acts later in the reaction presumably by preventing the formation of a recombinagenic synaptic intermediate. The mechanism of action of Xis-L5 appears to be purely architectural, influencing the assembly of protein–DNA structures solely through its DNA-binding and DNA-bending properties.
