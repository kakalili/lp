modulating calmodulin binding specificity through computational protein design
we report the computational redesign of the protein binding interface of calmodulin cam  a small ubiquitous ca  binding protein that is known to bind to and regulate a variety of functionally and structurally diverse proteins the cam binding interface was optimized to improve binding specificity towards one of its natural targets smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase smmlck  the optimization was performed using optimization of rotamers by iterative techniques orbit  a protein design program that utilizes a physically based force  field and the dead end elimination theorem to compute sequences that are optimal for a given protein scaffold starting from the structure of the cam  smmlck complex the program considered   amino acid residue sequences to obtain the lowest energy cam sequence the resulting eightfold mutant cam  was constructed and tested for binding to a set of seven cam target peptides cam  displayed high binding affinity to the smmlck peptide   nm  similar to that of the wild type protein   nm  the affinity of cam  to six other target peptides was reduced as intended by   fold to  fold hence cam  exhibited increased binding specificity preferring the smmlck peptide to the other targets studies of this type may increase our understanding of the origins of binding specificity in protein  ligand complexes and may provide valuable information that can be used in the design of novel protein receptors and or ligands
