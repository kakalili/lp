rearrangement of substrate secondary structure facilitates binding to the neurospora vs ribozyme
the neurospora vs ribozyme differs from other small naturally occurring ribozymes in that it recognizes for trans cleavage or ligation a substrate that consists largely of a stem loop structure we have previously found that cleavage or ligation by the vs ribozyme requires substantial rearrangement of the secondary structure of stem loop i which contains the cleavage ligation site this rearrangement includes breaking the top base pair of stem loop i allowing formation of a kissing interaction with loop v and changing the partners of at least three other base pairs within stem loop i to adopt a conformation termed shifted in the work presented we have designed a binding assay and used mutational analysis to investigate the contribution of each of these structural changes to binding and ligation we find that the loop i  v kissing interaction is necessary but not sufficient for binding and ligation constitutive opening of the top base pair of stem loop i has little if any effect on either activity in contrast the ability to adopt the shifted conformation of stem loop i is a major determinant of binding mutants that cannot adopt this conformation bind much more weakly than wild type and mutants with a constitutively shifted stem loop i bind much more strongly these results implicate the adoption of the shifted structure of stem loop i as an important process at the binding step in the vs ribozyme reaction pathway further investigation of features near the cleavage ligation site revealed that sulphur substitution of the non bridging phosphate oxygen atoms immediately downstream of the cleavage ligation site implicated in a putative metal ion binding site significantly altered the cleavage ligation equilibrium but did not perturb substrate binding significantly this indicates that the substituted oxygen atoms or an associated metal ion affect a step that occurs after binding and that they influence the rates of cleavage and ligation differently
