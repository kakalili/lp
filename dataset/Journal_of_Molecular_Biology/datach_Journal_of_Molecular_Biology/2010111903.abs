internalizing cancer antibodies from phage libraries selected on tumor cells and yeast displayed tumor antigens
a number of approaches have been utilized to generate antibodies to cancer cell surface receptors that can be used as potential therapeutics a number of these therapeutic approaches including antibody  drug conjugates immunotoxins and targeted nucleic acid delivery require antibodies that not only bind receptor but also undergo internalization into the cell upon binding we previously reported on the ability to generate cancer cell binding and internalizing antibodies directly from human phage antibody libraries selected for internalization into cancer cell lines while a number of useful antibodies have been generated using this approach limitations include the inability to direct the selections to specific antigens and to identify the antigen bound by the antibodies here we show that these limitations can be overcome by using yeast displayed antigens known to be associated with a cell type to select the phage antibody output after several rounds of selection on a mammalian cell line we used this approach to generate several human phage antibodies to yeast displayed epha and cd  the antibodies bound both yeast displayed and mammalian cell surface antigens and were endocytosed upon binding to mammalian cells this approach is generalizable to many mammalian cell surface proteins results in the generation of functional internalizing antibodies and does not require antigen expression and purification for antibody generation
