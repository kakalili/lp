specificity of the suv   h and suv   h protein lysine methyltransferases and methylation of novel substrates
the suv   h and suv   h enzymes methylate histone h at k  and they have overlapping and distinct biological effects here by in vitro methylation studies we confirmed that both the murine suv   h enzymes strongly favor the monomethylated h k  peptide substrate we also show that both enzymes only generate dimethylated h k  products we determined the substrate sequence recognition motif of both enzymes using spot peptide arrays showing that suv   h recognizes an ry kme  ivlm  lfi x d sequence in contrast suv   h shows less specificity and recognizes an x kme  ivlmk  lvfi x dev sequence which is partially overlapping with suv   h but has relaxed specificity at the   and  positions if the target h k me is positon   based on our data we identify novel peptide substrates for suv   h  k   of zinc finger protein castor homolog  and suv   h  k   of zinc finger protein castor homolog  k  of protein mis  beta and k  of centromere protein u  all these lysine residues were already identified to be methylated in human cells but the responsible pkmt was not known in addition we also tested the activity of suv   h enzymes on erk  which was recently reported to be methylated by suv   h at k  and k   however the sequences surrounding both methylation sites do not fit to the specificity profile of suv   h and we could not detect methylation of erk by any of the suv   h enzymes the possible reasons of this discrepancy and its consequences are discussed
