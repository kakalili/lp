protein transport into the human endoplasmic reticulum
protein transport into the endoplasmic reticulum er is essential for all eukaryotic cells and evolutionary related to protein transport into and across the cytoplasmic membrane of eubacteria and archaea it is based on amino terminal signal peptides in the precursor polypeptides plus various transport components in cytosol plus er and can occur either cotranslationally or posttranslationally the two mechanisms merge at the heterotrimeric sec  complex in the er membrane which forms an aqueous polypeptide conducting channel since the mammalian er is also the main intracellular calcium storage organelle the sec  complex is tightly regulated in its dynamics between the open and closed conformations by various ligands such as precursor polypeptides at the cytosolic face and the hsp  type molecular chaperone bip at the er lumenal face hsp heat shock protein  furthermore bip binding to the incoming precursor polypeptide contributes to unidirectionality and efficiency of transport recent insights into the structural dynamics of the sec  complex and related complexes in eubacteria and archaea have various mechanistic and functional implications
