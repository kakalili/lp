crystal structures of xanthomonas small heat shock protein provide a structural basis for an active molecular chaperone oligomer
small heat shock proteins shsps are ubiquitous low molecular weight chaperones that prevent protein aggregation under cellular stresses shsps contain a structurally conserved  crystallin domain acd of about   amino acid residues flanked by varied n and c terminal extensions and usually exist as oligomers oligomerization is important for the biological functions of most shsps however the active oligomeric states of shsps are not defined yet we present here crystal structures up to     resolution of the shspa from the plant pathogen xanthomonas xahspa  xahspa forms closed or open trimers of dimers hexamers in crystals but exists predominantly as  mers in solution as estimated by size exclusion chromatography the xahspa monomer structures mainly consist of  crystallin domain with disordered n and c terminal extensions indicating that the extensions are flexible and not essential for the formation of dimers and  mers under reducing conditions where  lactalbumin la unfolds and aggregates xahspa  mers formed complexes with one la per xahspa dimer based on xahspa dimer  dimer interactions observed in crystals we propose that xahspa  mers have four possible conformations but only xahspa  merb which is formed by open hexamers in  mer mer mer  mer with protruding dimers accessible for substrate unfolding protein binding can bind to  reduced la molecules together our results unravel the structural basis of an active shsp oligomer
