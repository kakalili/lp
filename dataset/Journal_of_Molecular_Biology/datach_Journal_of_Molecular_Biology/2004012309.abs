folding mechanism of fis the intertwined dimeric factor for inversion stimulation
fis the factor for inversion stimulation from escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria is an interwined  helical homodimer size exclusion chromatography and static light scattering measurements demonstrated that fis is predominately a stable dimer at the concentrations      m monomer and buffer conditions employed in this study the folding and unfolding of fis were studied with both equilibrium and kinetic methods by circular dichroism using urea and guanidinium chloride gdmcl as the perturbants the equilibrium folding is reversible and well described by a two state folding model with stabilities at   c of   kcalmol   in urea and   kcalmol   in gdmcl the kinetic data are consistent with a two step folding reaction where the two unfolded monomers associate to a dimeric intermediate within the mixing time for the stopped flow instrument  lt  ms  and a slower subsequent folding of the dimeric intermediate to the native dimer fits of the burst phase amplitudes as a function of denaturant showed that the free energy for the formation of the dimeric intermediate constitutes the majority of the stability of the folding   kcalmol   in urea and   kcalmol   in gdmcl  folding to unfolding double jump kinetic experiments were also performed to monitor the formation of native dimer as a function of folding delay times the data here demonstrate that the dimeric intermediate is obligatory and on pathway the folding mechanism of fis when compared to other intertwined   helical homodimers suggests that a transient kinetic dimeric intermediate may be a common feature of the folding of intertwined segment swapped   helical dimers
