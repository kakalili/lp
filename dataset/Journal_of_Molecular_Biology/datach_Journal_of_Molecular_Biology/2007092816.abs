prlf and yhav encode a new toxin  antitoxin system in escherichia coli
toxin  antitoxin systems consist of a stable toxin frequently with endonuclease activity and a small labile antitoxin which sequesters the toxin into an inactive complex under unfavorable conditions the antitoxin is degraded leading to activation of the toxin and resulting in growth arrest possibly also in bacterial programmed cell death correspondingly these systems are generally viewed as agents of the stress response in prokaryotes here we show that prlf and yhav encode a novel toxin  antitoxin system in escherichia coli yhav a ribonuclease of the rele superfamily causes reversible bacteriostasis that is counteracted by prlf a swapped hairpin transcription factor homologous to maze the two proteins form a tight hexameric complex which binds with high specificity to a conserved sequence in the promoter region of the prlf yhav operon as homologs of maze and rele respectively prlf and yhav provide an evolutionary connection between the two best characterized toxin  antitoxin systems in e coli mazef and releb
