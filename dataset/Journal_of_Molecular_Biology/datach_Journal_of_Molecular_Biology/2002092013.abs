crystal structures of uninhibited factor viia link its cofactor and substrate assisted activation to specific interactions
factor viia initiates the extrinsic coagulation cascade this event requires a delicately balanced regulation that is implemented on different levels including a sophisticated multi step activation mechanism of factor vii its central role in hemostasis and thrombosis makes factor viia a key target of pharmaceutical research we succeeded for the first time in recombinantly producing n terminally truncated factor vii rf  in an escherichia coli expression system by employing an oxidative in vitro folding protocol which depends critically on the presence of ethylene glycol activated recombinant factor viia rf a was crystallised in the presence of the reversible s site inhibitor benzamidine comparison of this    crystal structure with that of an inhibitor free and sulphate free but isomorphous crystal form identified structural details of factor viia stimulation the stabilisation of asp  ser  by benzamidine and the capping of the intermediate helix by a sulphate ion appear to be sufficient to mimic the disorder  order transition conferred by the cofactor tissue factor tf and the substrate factor x factor viia shares with the homologous factor ixa but not factor xa a bell shaped activity modulation dependent on ethylene glycol the ethylene glycol binding site of rf a was identified in the vicinity of the  loop ethylene glycol binding induces a significant conformational rearrangement of the  loop this region serves as a recognition site of the physiologic substrate factor x which is common to both factor viia and factor ixa these results provide a mechanistic framework of substrate assisted catalysis of both factor viia and factor ixa
