the transmembrane domain of the oncogenic mutant erbb  receptor a structure obtained from site specific infrared dichroism and molecular dynamics
erbb  is a member of the family of epidermal growth factor receptors which shows an oncogenic mutation in the rat gene neu val  glu in the transmembrane domain that causes permanent dimerisation and subsequently leads to uncontrollable cell division and tumour formation we have obtained the  helical structure of the mutant transmembrane domain dimer experimentally with site specific infrared dichroism ssid based on six transmembrane peptides with  c o carbonyl group labelled residues the derived orientational data indicate a local helix tilt ranging from      to      altogether using orientational constraints from ssid and experimental  helical constraints while performing a systematic conformational search including molecular dynamics simulation in a lipid bilayer we have obtained a unique experimentally defined atomic structure the resulting structure consists of a right handed  helical bundle with the residues ile   val   leu   ile   val  and leu  in the dimerisation interface the right handed bundle is in contrast to the left handed structures obtained in previous modelling efforts in order to facilitate tight helical packing the spacious glu  residues do not interact directly but with water molecules that enter the bilayer
