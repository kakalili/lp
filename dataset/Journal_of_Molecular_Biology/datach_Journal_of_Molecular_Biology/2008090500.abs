probing conserved helical modules of portal complexes by mass spectrometry based hydrogen deuterium exchange
the double stranded dna bacteriophage p  has a ring shaped dodecameric complex composed of the   kda portal protein subunit that forms the central channel of the phage dna packaging motor the overall morphology of the p  portal complex is similar to that of the portal complexes of phi  spp  t  t phages and herpes simplex virus secondary structure prediction of p  portal protein and its threading onto the crystal structure of the phi  portal complexes suggested that the p  portal protein complex shares conserved helical modules that were found in the dodecameric interfaces of the phi  portal complex to identify the amino acids involved in intersubunit contacts in the p  portal ring complexes and validate the threading model we performed comparative hydrogen deuterium exchange analysis of monomeric and in vitro assembled portal proteins of p  and the dodecameric phi  portal hydrogen deuterium exchange experiments provided evidence of intersubunit interactions in the p  portal complex similar to those in the phi  portal that map to the regions predicted to be conserved helical modules
