lysozyme amyloid oligomers and fibrils induce cellular death via different apoptotic necrotic pathways
among the newly discovered amyloid properties its cytotoxicity plays a key role lysozyme is a ubiquitous protein involved in systemic amyloidoses in vivo and forming amyloid under destabilising conditions in vitro we characterized both oligomers and fibrils of hen lysozyme by atomic force microscopy and demonstrated their dose      m and time dependent     h effect on neuroblastoma sh sy y cell viability we revealed that fibrils induce a decrease of cell viability after  h due to membrane damage shown by inhibition of wst  reduction early lactate dehydrogenase release and propidium iodide intake by contrast oligomers activate caspases after  h but cause the cell viability to decline only after   h as shown by fluorescent labelled annexin v binding to externalized phosphatidylserine propidium iodide dna staining lactate dehydrogenase release and by typical apoptotic shrinking of cells we conclude that oligomers induce apoptosis like cell death while the fibrils lead to necrosis like death as polymorphism is a common property of an amyloid we demonstrated that it is not a single uniform species but rather a continuum of cross  sheet containing amyloids that are cytotoxic an abundance of lysozyme highlights a universal feature of this phenomenon indicating that amyloid toxicity should be assessed in all clinical applications involving proteinaceous materials
