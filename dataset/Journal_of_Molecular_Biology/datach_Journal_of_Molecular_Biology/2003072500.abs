mutual induced fit binding of xenopus ribosomal protein l to s rrna
a library of random mutations in xenopus ribosomal protein l was generated by error prone pcr and used to delineate the binding domain for s rrna all but one of the amino acid substitutions that affected binding affinity are clustered in the central region of the protein several of the mutations are conservative substitutions of non polar amino acid residues that are unlikely to form energetically significant contacts to the rna thermal denaturation monitored by circular dichroism cd  indicates that l is not fully structured and association with s rrna increases the tm of the protein by   c l induces changes in the cd spectrum of s rrna establishing that the complex forms by a mutual induced fit mechanism deuterium exchange reveals that a considerable amount of l is unstructured in the absence of s rrna the fluorescence emission of w  provides evidence for structural changes in the c terminal region of l upon binding to s rrna whereas protection experiments demonstrate that the n terminus remains highly sensitive to protease digestion in the complex analysis of the amino acid sequence of l by the program pondr predicts that the n and c terminal regions of l are intrinsically disordered but that the central region which contains three essential tyrosine residues and other residues important for binding to s rrna is likely to be structured initial interaction of the protein with s rrna likely occurs through this region followed by induced folding of the c terminal region the persistent disorder in the n terminal domain is possibly exploited for interactions between the l   s rrna complex and other proteins
