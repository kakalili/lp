efficient selection of darpins with sub nanomolar affinities using srp phage display
there is an ever increasing demand to select specific high affinity binding molecules against targets of biomedical interest the success of such selections depends strongly on the design and functional diversity of the library of binding molecules employed and on the performance of the selection strategy we recently developed srp phage display that employs the cotranslational signal recognition particle srp pathway for the translocation of proteins to the periplasm this system allows efficient filamentous phage display of highly stable and fast folding proteins such as designed ankyrin repeat proteins darpins that are virtually refractory to conventional phage display employing the post translational sec pathway darpins comprise a novel class of binding molecules suitable to complement or even replace antibodies in many biotechnological or biomedical applications so far all darpins have been selected by ribosome display here we harnessed srp phage display to generate a phage darpin library containing more than   individual members we were able to select well behaved and highly specific darpins against a broad range of target proteins having affinities as low as   pm directly from this library without affinity maturation we describe efficient selection on the fc domain of human igg tnf  erbb  egfr  erbb  her  and erbb  her  as examples thus srp phage display makes filamentous phage display accessible for darpins allowing for example selection under harsh conditions or on whole cells we envision that the use of srp phage display will be beneficial for other libraries of stable and fast folding proteins
