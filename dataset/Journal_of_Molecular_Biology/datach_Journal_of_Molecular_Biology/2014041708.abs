folding and unfolding pathways of the human telomeric g quadruplex
sequence analogs of human telomeric dna such as d aggg ttaggg   tel  fold into monomeric quadruplex structures in the presence of a suitable cation to investigate the pathway for unimolecular quadruplex formation we monitored the kinetics of k induced folding of tel  by circular dichroism cd  intrinsic  aminopurine fluorescence and fluorescence resonance energy transfer fret  the results are consistent with a four step pathway u   i   i   i   f where u and f represent unfolded and folded conformational ensembles and i  i  and i are intermediates previous kinetic studies have shown that i is formed in a rapid pre equilibrium and may consist of an ensemble of  prefolded  hairpin structures brought about by cation induced electrostatic collapse of the dna the current study shows that i converts to i with a relaxation time    s at   c in  mm kcl the cd spectrum of i is characteristic of an antiparallel quadruplex that could form as a result of intramolecular fold over of the i hairpins i is relatively slowly formed      s and has cd and fret properties consistent with those expected of a triplex structure as previously observed in equilibrium melting studies i converts to f with     s identical pathways with different kinetic constants involving a rapidly formed antiparallel intermediate were observed with oligonucleotides forming mixed parallel antiparallel hybrid  and hybrid  topologies e g d ttggg ttaggg a and d taggg ttaggg tt  aspects of the kinetics of unfolding were also monitored by the spectroscopic methods listed above and by time resolved fluorescence lifetime measurements using a complementary strand trap assay these experiments reveal a slow rate limiting step along the unfolding pathway
