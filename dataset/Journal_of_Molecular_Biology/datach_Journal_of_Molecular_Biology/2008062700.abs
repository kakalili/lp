pre folding i b  alters control of nf  b signaling
transcription complex components frequently show coupled folding and binding but the functional significance of this mode of molecular recognition is unclear i b  binds to and inhibits the transcriptional activity of nf  b via its ankyrin repeat ar domain the  hairpins in ars    in i b  are weakly folded in the free protein and their folding is coupled to nf  b binding here we show that introduction of two stabilizing mutations in i b  ar  causes ars    to fold cooperatively to a conformation similar to that in nf  b bound i b  free i b  is degraded by a proteasome dependent but ubiquitin independent mechanism and this process is slower for the pre folded mutants both in vitro and in cells interestingly the pre folded mutants bind nf  b more weakly as shown by both surface plasmon resonance and isothermal titration calorimetry in vitro and immunoprecipitation experiments from cells one consequence of the weaker binding is that resting cells containing these mutants show incomplete inhibition of nf  b activation they have significant amounts of nuclear nf  b additionally the weaker binding combined with the slower rate of degradation of the free protein results in reduced levels of nuclear nf  b upon stimulation these data demonstrate clearly that the coupled folding and binding of i b  is critical for its precise control of nf  b transcriptional activity
