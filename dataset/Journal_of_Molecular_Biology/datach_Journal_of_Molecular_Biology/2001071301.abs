dna binding and cleavage selectivity of the escherichia coli dna g t mismatch endonuclease vsr protein  edited by j karn
the escherichia coli vsr endonuclease recognises t g base pair mismatches in double stranded dna and initiates a repair pathway by hydrolysing the phosphate group   to the incorrectly paired t the gene encoding the vsr endonuclease is next to the gene specifying the e coli dcm dna methyltransferase an enzyme that adds ch groups to the first dc within its target sequence cc a t gg giving c mec a t gg deamination of the d mec results in ct a t gg in which the first t is mis paired with dg and it is believed that the endonuclease preferentially recognises t g mismatches within the dcm recognition site here the preference of the vsr endonuclease for bases surrounding the t g mismatch has been evaluated determination of specificity constant kst kd kst  rate constant for single turnover kd  equilibrium dissociation constant confirms vsr  s preference for a t g mismatch within a dcm sequence i e ct a t gg the underlined t being mis paired with dg is the best substrate however the enzyme is capable of binding and hydrolysing sequences that differ from the dcm target site by a single base pair dcm star sites  individual alteration of any of the four bases surrounding the mismatched t gives a substrate albeit with reduced binding affinity and slowed turnover rates the vsr endonuclease has a much lower selectivity for the dcm sequence than type ii restriction endonucleases have for their target sites the results are discussed in the light of the known crystal structure of the vsr protein and its possible physiological role
