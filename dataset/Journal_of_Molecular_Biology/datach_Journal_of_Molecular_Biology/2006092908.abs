oleic acid inhibits amyloid formation of the intermediate of  lactalbumin at moderately acidic ph
the effects of oleic acid on amyloid formation of ca  depleted bovine  lactalbumin apo bla at low ph and the biological impact of the effects were investigated by using thioflavin t congo red far uv circular dichroism atomic force microscopy transmission electron microscopy and other biophysical methods the results from the phase diagram method of fluorescence show that two intermediates exist in the conformational transition of apo bla induced by low ph one intermediate populated at ph   is characterized as a molten globule state and the other accumulates with stable secondary structure and exposed hydrophobic surface at ph      amyloid formation of apo bla takes place upon decreasing the ph to   and is accelerated remarkably as the ph is decreased further however amyloid fibrils of apo bla are not observed in the ph range of      on a time scale of   days the lag time of fibrillation at ph   is greatly elongated by the presence of oleic acid accompanied by a remarkable decline of the maximum thioflavin t intensity furthermore amyloid formation of apo bla at ph   is inhibited completely by oleic acid and insoluble aggregates are observed in contrast the effects of oleic acid on amyloid formation are not remarkable at ph   or at ph   our data demonstrate that oleic acid specifically induces the intermediate of apo bla at ph      to form insoluble amorphous aggregates which is responsible for the inhibition of amyloid formation of the protein by oleic acid in this range of ph values
