alternate binding modes for a ubiquitin  sh domain interaction studied by nmr spectroscopy
surfaces of many binding domains are plastic enabling them to interact with multiple targets an understanding of how they bind and recognize their partners is therefore predicated on characterizing such dynamic interfaces yet these interfaces are difficult to study by standard biophysical techniques that often  freeze  out conformations or that produce data averaged over an ensemble of conformers in this study we used nmr spectroscopy to study the interaction between the c terminal sh domain of cin  and ubiquitin that involves the  classical  binding sites of these proteins notably chemical shift titration data of one target with another and relaxation dispersion data that report on millisecond time scale exchange processes are both well fit to a simple binding model in which free protein is in equilibrium with a single bound conformation however dissociation constants and chemical shift differences between free and bound states measured from both classes of experiment are in disagreement it is shown that the data can be reconciled by considering three state binding models involving two distinct bound conformations by combining titration and dispersion data kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the three state binding reaction are obtained along with chemical shifts for each state a picture emerges in which one bound conformer has increased entropy and enthalpy relative to the second and chemical shifts similar to that of the free state suggesting a less packed interface this study provides an example of the interplay between entropy and enthalpy to fine tune molecular interactions involving the same binding surfaces
