crystal structure of mhc class ii i ab in complex with a human clip peptide prediction of an i ab peptide binding motif
association between the class ii major histocompatibility complex mhc and the class ii invariant chain associated peptide clip occurs naturally as an intermediate step in the mhc class ii processing pathway here we report the crystal structure of the murine class ii mhc molecule i ab in complex with human clip at    resolution the structure of i ab accounts via the peptide binding groove s unique physicochemistry for the distinct peptide repertoire bound by this allele clip adopts a similar conformation to peptides bound by other i a alleles reinforcing the notion that clip is presented as a conventional peptide antigen when compared to the related hla dr clip complex structure the clip peptide displays a slightly different conformation and distinct interaction pattern with residues in i ab in addition after examining the published sequences of peptides presented by i ab we discuss the possibility of predicting peptide alignment in the i ab binding groove using a simple scoring matrix
