mechanism of dna recognition by the restriction enzyme ecorv
ecorv a restriction enzyme in escherichia coli destroys invading foreign dna by cleaving it at the center step of a gatatc sequence in the ecorv  cognate dna crystallographic complex a sharp kink of   has been found at the center base pair step ta  here we examine the interplay between the intrinsic propensity of the cognate sequence to kink and the induction by the enzyme by performing all atom molecular dynamics simulations of ecorv unbound and interacting with three dna sequences the cognate sequence gatatc ta  the non cognate sequence gaattc at  and with the cognate sequence methylated on the first adenine gach tatc ta ch  in the unbound ecorv the cleft between the two c terminal subdomains is found to be open binding to at narrows the cleft and forms a partially bound state however the intrinsic bending propensity of at is insufficient to allow tight binding in contrast the cognate ta sequence is easier to bend allowing specific high occupancy hydrogen bonds to form in the complex the absence of cleavage for this methylated sequence is found to arise from the loss of specific hydrogen bonds between the first adenine of the recognition sequence and asn   on the basis of the results we suggest a three step recognition mechanism in the first step ecorv in an open conformation binds to the dna at a random sequence and slides along it in the second step when the two outer base pairs gaxxtc are recognized the r loops of the protein become more ordered forming strong hydrogen bonding interactions resulting in a partially bound ecorv  dna complex in the third step the flexibility of the center base pair is probed and in the case of the full cognate sequence the dna bends the complex strengthens and the protein and dna interact more closely allowing cleavage
