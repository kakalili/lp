a novel mutation in the neurofibromatosis type  nf  gene promotes skipping of two exons by preventing exon definition edited by m yaniv
using a protein truncation assay we have identified a new mutation in the neurofibromatosis type  nf  gene that causes a severe defect in nf pre mrna splicing the mutation which consists of a g to a transition at position  of the   splice site of exon  a is associated with the loss of both exons  and  a in the nf mrna through the use of in vivo and in vitro splicing assays we show that the mutation inactivates the   splice site of exon  a and prevents the definition of exon  a a process that is normally required to stimulate the weak   splice site of exon  a because the   splice site mutation weakens the interaction of splicing factors with the   splice site of exon  a we propose that exon  exon  a splicing is also compromised leading to the exclusion of both exons  and  a our results provide in vivo support for the importance of the exon definition model during nf splicing and suggest that the nf region containing exons  and  a plays an important role in the activity of neurofibromin
