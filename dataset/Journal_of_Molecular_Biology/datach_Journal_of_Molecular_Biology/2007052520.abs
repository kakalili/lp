stable complexes formed by hiv  reverse transcriptase at distinct positions on the primer template controlled by binding deoxynucleoside triphosphates or foscarnet
binding of the next complementary dntp by the binary complex containing hiv  reverse transcriptase rt and primer template induces conformational changes that have been implicated in catalytic function of rt we have used dnase i footprinting gel electrophoretic mobility shift and exonuclease protection assays to characterize the interactions between hiv  rt and chain terminated primer template in the absence and presence of various ligands distinguishable stable complexes were formed in the presence of foscarnet an analog of pyrophosphate  the dntp complementary to the first   templating nucleotide or the dntp complementary to the second   templating nucleotide the position of hiv  rt on the primer template in each of these complexes is different rt is located upstream in the foscarnet complex relative to the  complex and downstream in the  complex these results suggest that hiv  rt can translocate along the primer template in the absence of phosphodiester bond formation the ability to form a specific foscarnet complex might explain the inhibitory properties of this compound the ability to recognize the second templating nucleotide has implications for nucleotide misincorporation
