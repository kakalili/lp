catchin a novel protein in molluscan catch muscles is produced by alternative splicing from the myosin heavy chain gene edited by j karn
molluscan catch muscles contain polypeptides of      kda in size which have the same partial amino acid sequences as those of the myosin heavy chain mhc  here we provide evidence that these polypeptides are major components only of the catch type muscles their estimated molar ratio to mhc is approximately   and they are alternative products of the mhc gene northern blot analysis of total rna from mytilus galloprovincialis catch muscles was carried out with fragments from the   end of the mhc cdna as probes we detected two bands of   kb and   kb the former corresponds to the mhc mrna and the latter is an mrna coding for catchin a novel myosin rod like protein by using a   rapid amplification of cdna ends race pcr method the full length cdna of mytilus catchin was cloned it codes for a protein with a unique n terminal domain of   residues rich in serine threonine and proline  which includes a phosphorylatable peptide sequence the rest of the sequence is identical with the c terminal   residues of the mhc we also analyzed mytilus and scallop argopecten irradians genomic dnas and found that the   end of the cdna sequence was located in a large intron of the mhc gene in both species since catchin is abundantly expressed only in catch muscles and it is phosphorylatable we suggest that it may play an important role in the catch contraction of molluscan smooth muscles
