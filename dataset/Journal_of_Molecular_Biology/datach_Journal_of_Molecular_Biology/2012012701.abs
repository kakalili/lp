a reverse binding motif that contributes to specific protease inhibition by antibodies
the type ii transmembrane serine protease family consists of  closely related serine proteases that are implicated in multiple functions to identify selective inhibitory antibodies against one particular type ii transmembrane serine protease matriptase mt sp  membrane type serine protease   a phage display library was created with a natural repertoire of fabs fragment antigen binding fab  from human na ve b cells fab a  was identified with a   pm inhibition constant and high specificity for matriptase over other trypsin fold serine proteases a trichoderma reesei system expressed a  with a yield of     mg l the crystal structure of a  in complex with matriptase has been determined and compared to the crystal structure of another antibody inhibitor s  in complex with matriptase previously discovered from a synthetic single chain variable fragment library s is also a highly selective and potent matriptase inhibitor the crystal structures of the a  matriptase and s matriptase complexes were solved to     and     respectively although these antibodies discovered from separate libraries interact differently with the protease surface loops for their specificity the structures reveal a similar novel mechanism of protease inhibition through the insertion of the h variable loop in a reverse orientation at the substrate binding pocket these antibodies bury a large surface area for potent inhibition and avoid proteolytic inactivation this discovery highlights the critical role that the antibody scaffold plays in positioning loops to bind and inhibit protease function in a highly selective manner additionally fab a  is a fully human antibody that specifically inhibits matriptase over other closely related proteases suggesting that this approach could be useful for clinical applications
