titins in c elegans with unusual features coiled coil domains novel regulation of kinase activity and two new possible elastic regions
we report that there are previously unrecognized proteins in caenorhabditis elegans that are similar to the giant muscle proteins called titins and these are encoded by a single   kb gene the gene structure was predicted by genemark hmm and then experimentally verified the ce titin gene encodes polypeptides of  mda   mda and  kda the  mda isoform resembles twitchin and unc  in that it contains multiple ig   and fniii   domains and a single protein kinase domain in addition however the  mda isoform contains four classes of short     residue repeat motifs arranged mostly in many tandem copies one of these tandem repeat regions is similar to the pevk regions of vertebrate and fly titins as the pevk region is one of the main elastic elements of the titins and is also composed of short tandem repeats this suggests that the repeat motifs in the ce titins may have a similar elastic function an interesting aspect of the two largest ce titin isoforms is that in contrast to other members of the twitchin titin family there are multiple regions which are likely to form coiled coil structure in transgenic animals the first    residues of the largest isoforms targets to dense bodies the worm analogs of z discs anti ce titin antibodies show localization to muscle i bands beginning at the l  l larval stages and this pattern continues into adult muscle ce titins may not have a role in early myofibril assembly   ce titins are too short to span half a sarcomere and the onset of their expression is well after the initial assembly of thick filaments   ce titins are not localized to i bands in embryonic or l larval muscle the ce titin protein kinase domain is most similar to the kinase domains of the twitchins and projectin the ce titin kinase has protein kinase activity in vitro and this activity is regulated by a novel mechanism
