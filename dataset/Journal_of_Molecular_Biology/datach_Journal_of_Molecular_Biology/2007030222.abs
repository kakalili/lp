kinking the coiled coil   negatively charged residues at the coiled coil interface
the coiled coil is one of the most common protein structure motifs it is believed to be adopted by    of all amino acids in proteins it comprises two or more  helical chains wrapped around one another the sequences of most coiled coils are characterized by a seven residue heptad repeat denoted abcdefg n residues at the a and d positions define the helical interface core and are usually hydrophobic though about   are polar or charged we show that parallel coiled coils have a unique pattern of their negatively charged residues at the core positions aspartic acid is excluded from these positions while glutamic acid is not in contrast the antiparallel structures are more permissive in their amino acid usage we show further and for the first time that incorporation of asp but not glu into the a positions of a parallel coiled coil creates a flexible hinge and that the maximal hinge angle is being directly related to the number of incorporated mutations these new computational and experimental observations will be of use in improving protein structure predictions and as rules to guide rational design of novel coiled coil motifs and coiled coil based materials
