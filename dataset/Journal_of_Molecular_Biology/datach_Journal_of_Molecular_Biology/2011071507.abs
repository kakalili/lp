characterization of the structure and function of klebsiella pneumoniae allantoin racemase
the oxidative catabolism of uric acid produces  hydroxyisourate hiu  which is further degraded to s allantoin by two enzymes hiu hydrolase and  oxo  hydroxy  carboxy  ureidoimidazoline decarboxylase the intermediates of the latter two reactions hiu and  oxo  hydroxy  carboxy  ureidoimidazoline are unstable in solution and decay nonstereospecifically to allantoin in addition nonenzymatic racemization of allantoin has been shown to occur at physiological ph since the further breakdown of allantoin is catalyzed by allantoinase an enzyme that is specific for s allantoin an allantoin racemase is necessary for complete and efficient catabolism of uric acid in this work we characterize the structure and activity of allantoin racemase from klebsiella pneumoniae kphpxa  in addition to an unliganded structure solved using selenomethionyl single wavelength anomalous dispersion structures of c s c  s kphpxa in complex with allantoin and with  acetylhydantoin are presented these structures reveal several important features of the active site including an oxyanion hole and a polar binding pocket that interacts with the ureido tail of allantoin and serves to control the orientation of the hydantoin ring the ability of kphpxa to interconvert the r  and s enantiomers of allantoin is demonstrated and analysis of the steady state kinetics of kphpxa yielded a kcat km of      m   s   mutation of either of the active site cysteines cys  or cys   to serine inactivates this enzyme the data presented provide new insights into the activity and substrate specificity of this enzyme and enable us to propose a mechanism for catalysis that is consistent with the two base mechanism observed in other members of the aspartate glutamate family
