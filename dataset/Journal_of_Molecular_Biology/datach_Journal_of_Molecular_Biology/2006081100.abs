unwinding single rna molecules using helicases involved in eukaryotic translation initiation
the small   s subunit of the eukaryotic ribosome may have to scan more than   nucleotides  gt   nm from its   cap recruiting point on an mrna molecule before initiating on a translation start codon as with many other processes in living cells including transcription editing mrna splicing pre rrna processing rna transport and rna decay scanning is facilitated by helicase activity however precise quantitative data on the molecular mechanism of scanning including the roles of helicases are lacking here we describe a novel atomic force microscopy afm based procedure to examine the roles of two yeast helicases eif a and ded  previously implicated in translation initiation by genetic and biochemical studies our results show that eif a especially in the presence of its  cofactor  eif b promotes atp dependent unwinding of localised secondary structure in long rna molecules under tensional loading albeit only at high protein rna ratios thus eif a can act to separate only a limited number of base pairs possibly via a steric unwinding mechanism in contrast ded is more effective in reducing by up to   pn at an afm loading rate of  nns   the force necessary to disrupt an rna stem loop and thus shows significant kinetic competence to facilitate fast unwinding these single molecule experiments indicate that ded is likely to act as the more potent unwinding factor on natural mrna substrates
