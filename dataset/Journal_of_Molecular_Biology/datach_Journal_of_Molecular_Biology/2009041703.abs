novel insights into the mechanisms of cin  sh domains binding to cbl proteins solution based investigations and in vivo implications
cin  is a multifunctional protein that plays key roles in endocytic down regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases apoptosis cell adhesion and cytoskeleton rearrangement its three sh domains cin a cin b and cin c allow it to recruit multiple binding partners to understand the manifold interactions of cin  we present a detailed high resolution solution structural study of cin a and cin b binding to proline  arginine peptides derived from the cognate ligands cbl and cbl b we report the structure of cin b and provide evidence that both cin a and cin b in isolation or when linked form heterodimeric complexes with the peptides we report unusual curved chemical shift changes for several residues of cin a when titrated with cbl b peptide indicating the existence of more than one complex form here we demonstrate that cin a and cin b use different mechanisms for peptide binding
