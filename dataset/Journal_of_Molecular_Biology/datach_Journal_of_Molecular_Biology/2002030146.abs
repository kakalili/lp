the unusually slow relaxation kinetics of the folding unfolding of pyrrolidone carboxyl peptidase from a hyperthermophile pyrococcus furiosus
in order to understand the thermodynamic and kinetic basis of the intrinsic stability of proteins from hyperthermophiles the folding unfolding reactions of cysteine free pyrrolidone carboxyl peptidase cys    ser  pcp sh from pyrococcus furiosus were examined using circular dichroism cd and differential scanning colorimetry dsc at ph    where pcp sh exists in monomeric form dsc showed a strong dependence of the shape and position of the unfolding profiles on the scan rate suggesting the stability of pcp sh under kinetic control on dsc timescales even at a scan rate of  deg c hour heat denaturation of pcp sh was non equilibrium however over a long period of incubation of the heat denatured pcp sh at pre transition temperatures it refolded completely indicating reversibility with very slow relaxation kinetics the rates of refolding of the heat denatured pcp sh determined from the time resolved dsc and cd spectroscopic progress curves were found to be similar within experimental error confirming the mechanism of refolding to be a two state process the equilibrium established with a relaxation time of   seconds at tm    c  which is unusually higher than the relaxation times observed for mesophilic and hyperthermophilic proteins the long relaxation time may lead to the apparent irreversibility of an unfolding process occurring on the dsc experiment timescale the refolding rate       s   peaked near the tm     c  whereas the stability profile reached maxima   kj mol   at   c the results clearly indicate the unusual mode of protein destabilization via a drastic decrease in the rate of folding at low ph and still maintaining a high activation energy barrier   kj mol   for unfolding which provides an effective kinetic advantage to unusually stable proteins from hyperthermophiles
