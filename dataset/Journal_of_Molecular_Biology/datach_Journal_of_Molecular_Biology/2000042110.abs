the three dimensional structure of a plasmodium falciparum cyclophilin in complex with the potent anti malarial cyclosporin a edited by k nagai
cyclosporin a csa is a potent anti malarial compound in vitro and in vivo in mice though better known for its immunosuppressive properties in humans crystal structures of wild type and a double mutant plasmodium falciparum cyclophilin pfcyp  and mpfcyp  complexed with csa have been determined using diffraction terms to a resolution of         nm  the wild type has a single pfcyp  csa complex per asymmetric unit in space group p and refined to an r work of   and r free of    an altered cyclophilin with two accidental mutations phe  to leu in the csa binding pocket and leu  to trp at the c terminus presents two complexes per asymmetric unit in the orthorhombic space group p    this refined to an r work of   and r free    the mutations were identified from the crystallographic analysis and the c terminal alteration helps to explain the different crystal forms obtained pfcyp  shares approximately   sequence identity with human cyclophilin a hcypa and the structures are similar consisting of an eight stranded antiparallel  barrel core capped by two  helices the fold creates a hydrophobic active site the floor of which is formed by side chains of residues from four antiparallel  strands and the walls from loops and turns we identified c  h  o hydrogen bonds between the drug and protein that may be an important feature of cyclophilins and suggest a general mode of interaction between hydrophobic molecules comparisons with cyclophilin dipeptide complexes suggests that a specific c  h  o hydrogen bonding interaction may contribute to ligand binding residues ser   his  and asp   located close to the active site and conserved in most cyclophilins are arranged in a manner reminiscent of a serine protease catalytic triad a ser  ala mutant was engineered to test the hypothesis that this triad contributes to cyp function mutant and wild type enzymes were found to have similar catalytic properties
