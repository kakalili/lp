highly stable binding proteins derived from the hyperthermophilic sso d scaffold
we have shown that highly stable binding proteins for a wide spectrum of targets can be generated through mutagenesis of the sso d protein from the hyperthermophilic archaeon sulfolobus solfataricus sso d is a small    kda   amino acids dna binding protein that lacks cysteine residues and has a melting temperature of nearly    c we generated a library of   sso d mutants by randomizing  amino acid residues on the dna binding surface of sso d using yeast surface display binding proteins for a diverse set of model targets could be isolated from this library our chosen targets included a small organic molecule fluorescein  a  amino acid peptide fragment from the c terminus of  catenin the model proteins hen egg lysozyme and streptavidin and immunoglobulins from chicken and mouse without the application of any affinity maturation strategy the binding proteins isolated had equilibrium dissociation constants in the nanomolar to micromolar range further sso d derived binding proteins could discriminate between closely related immunoglobulins mutant proteins based on sso d were expressed at high yields in the escherichia coli cytoplasm despite extensive mutagenesis sso d mutants have high thermal stability five of six mutants analyzed have melting temperatures gt    c they are also resistant to chemical denaturation by guanidine hydrochloride and retain their secondary structure after extended incubation at extreme ph values because of their favorable properties such as ease of recombinant expression and high thermal chemical and ph stability sso d derived binding proteins will have wide applicability in several areas of biotechnology and medicine
