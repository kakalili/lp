interaction of the atypical prokaryotic transcription activator flhd c with early promoters of the flagellar gene hierarchy
the transcriptional activator flhd c is the master regulator of bacterial flagellum biogenesis and swarming migration activating the  early  class ii promoters of the large flagellar gene hierarchy using primer extensions band shift assays and enzymatic and chemical footprinting we describe the binding of the flhd c heterotetramer to the promoter regions of four class ii flagella operons fliaz flhba and the divergent flgamn and flgbcd efghij  each of the promoter regions was bound by a single heterotetramer i e the flgamn and flgbcd operons are characterised by a single flhd c binding site binding affinity differed and correlated with previously reported promoter strength and order of activation methylation protection and interference and depurination and depyrimidation interference provided a detailed map of critical bases within a common    bp dnasei footprint overlapping the promoter    sequences these data and compilation of the  known class ii promoter sequences of escherichia coli proteus mirabilis and salmonella typhimurium allowed determination of a flhd c binding site with pseudo symmetry comprising two    bp inverted repeats each a consensus flhd c box separated by a    bp spacer dnasei hypersensitivity indicated that binding may cause a conformational change in the promoter regions only the flhc subunit can bind dna independently but the specificity and stability of the interaction is strengthened by flhd here photo crosslinking established that both flhc and the stabilising flhd contact the dna within the flhd c tetramer our data suggest that specificity of recognition and stability of the flhd c dna complex require protein  protein interaction and interaction of both flhc and flhd subunits with dna these characteristics of the flhd and flhc subunits in the flhd c dna complex are strikingly atypical of prokaryotic regulators
