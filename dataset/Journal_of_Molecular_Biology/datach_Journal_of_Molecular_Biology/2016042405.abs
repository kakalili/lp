distinct roles of mic  and mic  in the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system
the mitochondrial inner membrane consists of two morphologically distinct domains the inner boundary membrane and large invaginations termed cristae narrow membrane structures the crista junctions link these two domains maintenance of this elaborate architecture depends on the evolutionarily conserved mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system micos  a multisubunit inner membrane protein complex micos consists of two functional modules a mic   mic  subcomplex that forms mic  mediated contact sites with the outer mitochondrial membrane and a mic   mic   mic   mic  membrane sculpting subcomplex that contains large mic  oligomers deletion of mic  or mic  results in the loss of most crista junctions distinct views have been discussed about how the micos modules cooperate with each other we searched for components required for the structural organization of micos and identified mic  and mic  as crucial factors with specific roles in micos complex formation mic  promotes the stability of the mic  oligomers in the membrane sculpting subcomplex whereas mic  is required for the coupling of the two micos subcomplexes we conclude that in addition to the micos core components mic  and mic  mic  and mic  play specific roles in the organization of the micos complex
