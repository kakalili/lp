hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry reveals activation induced changes in the conformational mobility of p   map kinase
hydrogen  deuterium exchange measurements represent a powerful approach to investigating changes in conformation and conformational mobility in proteins here we examine p   map kinase mapk by hydrogen exchange hx mass spectrometry to determine whether changes in conformational mobility may be induced by kinase phosphorylation and activation factors influencing sequence coverage in the hx mass spectrometry experiment which show that varying sampling depths instruments and peptide search strategies yield the highest coverage of exchangeable amides are examined patterns of regional deuteration in p   are consistent with tertiary structure and similar to deuteration patterns previously determined for extracellular signal regulated kinase erk   indicating that mapks are conserved with respect to the extent of local amide hx activation of p   alters hx in five regions which are interpreted by comparing x ray structures of unphosphorylated p   and x ray structures of phosphorylated p   conformational differences account for altered hx within the activation lip the p  site and the active site in contrast hx alterations are ascribed to activation induced effects on conformational mobility within substrate docking sites  f   g       the c terminal core  e  and the n terminal core region        l   c  activation also decreases hx in a    helix at the c terminal extension of p   although this helix in erk forms a dimerization interface that becomes protected from hx upon activation analytical ultracentrifugation shows that this does not occur in p   because both unphosphorylated and diphosphorylated forms are monomeric finally hx patterns in monophosphorylated p   are similar to those in unphosphorylated kinase indicating that the major activation lip remodeling events occur only after diphosphorylation importantly patterns of activation induced hx show differences between p   and erk despite their similarities in overall deuteration suggesting that although mapks are closely related with respect to primary sequence and tertiary structure they have distinct mechanisms for dynamic control of enzyme function
