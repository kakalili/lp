high speed atomic force microscopy cooperative adhesion and dynamic equilibrium of junctional microdomain membrane proteins
junctional microdomains paradigm for membrane protein segregation in functional assemblies in eye lens fiber cell membranes are constituted of lens specific aquaporin  tetramers aqp  and connexin cx hexamers termed connexons both proteins have double function to assure nutrition and mediate adhesion of lens cells here we use high speed atomic force microscopy to examine microdomain protein dynamics at the single molecule level we found that the adhesion function of head to head associated aqp  and cx is cooperative this finding provides first experimental evidence for the mechanistic importance for junctional microdomain formation from the observation of lateral association  dissociation events of aqp  we determine that the enthalpic energy gain of a single aqp   aqp  interaction in the membrane plane is    kbt sufficient to drive formation of microdomains connexon association is stronger as dynamics are rarely observed explaining their rim localization in junctional microdomains
