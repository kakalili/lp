effects of substitutions in a conserved dx gr sequence motif found in many dna dependent nucleotide polymerases on transcription by t rna polymerase
the region in bacteriophage t rna polymerase rnap comprising residues      contains a sequence motif dx gr that is conserved among many dna dependent nucleotide polymerases we have found that alterations in this motif result in enzymes that display weaker retention of the rna product during transcript initiation a decreased ability to make the transition to a stable elongation complex and changes in substrate binding and catalytic activity many of these defects are coupled with an altered response to the presence or absence of the non template strand the observed constellation of defects supports a role for the motif in interacting with and stabilizing the rna dna hybrid during the early stages of transcript initiation this is consistent with the position of the motif in a t rnap initiation complex although a conserved dx gr sequence motif is also observed in multisubunit rnaps the structural organization of the motif and the manner in which it interacts with the rna dna hybrid in the latter enzymes is different from that in t rnap however another element in the multisubunit rnaps that contains a highly conserved arginine residue may play the same role as r  in t rnap
