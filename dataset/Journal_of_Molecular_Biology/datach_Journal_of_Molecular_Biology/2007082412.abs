the crystal structure of mcat from mycobacterium tuberculosis reveals three new catalytic models
the malonyl coenzyme a coa acyl carrier protein acp transacylase mcat plays a key role in cell wall biosynthesis in mycobacterium tuberculosis and other bacteria the m tuberculosis mcat mtmcat is encoded by the fabd gene and catalyzes the transacylation of malonate from malonyl coa to holo acp malonyl acp is the substrate in fatty acid biosynthesis and is a by product of the transacylation reaction this ability for fatty acid biosynthesis enables m tuberculosis to survive in hostile environments and thus understanding the mechanism of biosynthesis is important for the design of new anti tuberculosis drugs the     crystal structure of mtmcat reported here shows that its catalytic mechanism differs from those of scmcat and ecmcat whose structures have previously been determined in mtmcat the c   o  bond of ser  turns upwards resulting in a different orientation and thus an overall change of the active pocket compared to other known mcat enzymes we identify three new nucleophilic attack chains from the mtmcat structure his  ser  asn  wat ser  and asn  his  ser  enzyme activity assays show that his a asn  a and his a asn  a mutants all have substantially reduced mcat activity indicating that m tuberculosis mcat supports a unique means of proton transfer furthermore his  cannot form part of a his ser catalytic dyad and only stabilizes the substrate this new discovery should provide a deeper insight into the catalytic mechanisms of mcats
