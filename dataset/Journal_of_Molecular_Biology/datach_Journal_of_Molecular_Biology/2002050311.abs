interaction of the chaperone bip with an antibody domain implications for the chaperone cycle
bip is an hsp  homologue found in the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotic cells like other hsp  chaperones bip interacts with its substrate proteins in an atp dependent manner the functional analysis has so far been performed mainly with short synthetic peptides here we present an experimental system that allows to study the partial reactions of the bip chaperone cycle for a natural substrate protein domain in its soluble stably unfolded conformation this unfolded antibody domain forms a binary complex with bip in the absence of atp the dissociation of the bip dimer seems to be the rate limiting step in this reaction the bip  ch complexes dissociate rapidly in the presence of atp the affinity for bip binding peptides and the non native antibody domain was determined to be similar suggesting that only the peptide binding site is involved in these interactions furthermore these results imply that also in the context of the antibody domain an extended peptide sequence is recognized however the accessibility of the bip binding site in the non native protein seems to influence the kinetics of complex formation
