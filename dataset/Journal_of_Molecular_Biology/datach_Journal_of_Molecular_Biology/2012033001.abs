time dependent predominance of nonhomologous dna end joining pathways during embryonic development in mice
repair of dna double strand breaks dsbs is crucial for maintaining genomic integrity during the successful development of a fertilized egg into a whole organism to date the mechanism of dsb repair in postimplantation embryos has been largely unknown in the present study using a cell free repair system derived from the different embryonic stages of mice we find that canonical nonhomologous end joining nhej  one of the major dsb repair pathways in mammals is predominant at    day of embryonic development interestingly all four types of dsbs tested were repaired by ligase iv xrcc and ku dependent classical nhej characterization of end joined junctions and expression studies further showed evidences for canonical nhej strikingly in contrast to the above we observed noncanonical end joining accompanied by dsb resection dependent on microhomology and ligase iii in   day embryos interestingly we observed an elevated expression of ctip mre  and nbs at this stage suggesting that it could act as a switch between classical end joining and microhomology mediated end joining at later stages of embryonic development thus our results establish for the first time the existence of both canonical and alternative nhej pathways during the postimplantation stages of mammalian embryonic development
