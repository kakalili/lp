fibrillogenic and non fibrillogenic ensembles of sds bound human  synuclein
fibril formation of  synuclein is associated with several neurodegenerative diseases including parkinson s disease in humans the anionic detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate sds can accelerate the fibril formation in vitro however the molecular basis of this acceleration is not clear our study shows that native  synuclein exhibits relatively less fibril growth despite providing fibril seeds for nucleation the presence of sds promotes the seeded fibril growth in a concentration dependent manner with an optimal concentration of       mm we used isothermal calorimetry hydrophobic dye binding and circular dichroism spectroscopy to characterize the protein  detergent interactions as a function of the concentration of sds interaction of sds with  synuclein when studied by isothermal titration calorimetry and hydrophobic dye binding reveals a similar characteristic optimal behavior between   mm and    mm sds the study shows two types of ensembles of  synuclein and sds the fibrillogenic ensembles formed with optimal concentration of sds around       mm are characterized by enhanced accessible hydrophobic surfaces and extended to partially helical conformation while the less or non fibrillogenic ensembles formed above  mm sds are characterized by less accessible hydrophobic surfaces and maximal helical content little or no fibrillogenicity of the ensembles observed above  mm sds could be partly because of the observed intrinsic instability of the fibrils under the condition
