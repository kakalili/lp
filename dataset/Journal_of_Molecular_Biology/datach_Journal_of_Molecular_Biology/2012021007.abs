basic n terminus of yeast nhp a regulates the mechanism of its dna flexibility enhancement
hmgb high mobility group box proteins are members of a class of small proteins that are ubiquitous in eukaryotic cells and nonspecifically bind to dna inducing large angle dna bends enhancing the flexibility of dna and likely facilitating numerous important biological interactions to determine the nature of this behavior for different hmgb proteins we used atomic force microscopy to quantitatively characterize the bend angle distributions of dna complexes with human hmgb box a  yeast nhp a and two chimeric mutants of these proteins while all of the hmgb proteins bend dna to preferred angles nhp a promoted the formation of higher order oligomer structures and induced a significantly broader distribution of angles suggesting that the mechanism of nhp a is like a flexible hinge more than that of hmgb box a  to determine the structural origins of this behavior we used portions of the cationic n terminus of nhp a to replace corresponding hmgb box a sequences we found that the oligomerization and broader angle distribution correlated directly with the length of the n terminus incorporated into the hmgb box a construct therefore the basic n terminus of nhp a is responsible for its ability to act as a flexible hinge and to form high order structures
