multidrug resistant hiv  reverse transcriptase involvement of ribonucleotide dependent phosphorolysis in cross resistance to nucleoside analogue inhibitors
human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  strains having a dipeptide insertion between codons  and  of the viral reverse transcriptase rt have been observed in isolates from patients treated with   azido   deoxythymidine azt and other nucleoside analogues these viruses contain additional mutations related to drug resistance and display reduced susceptibility to most nucleoside analogue inhibitors including azt the mechanism of azt resistance implies an increased ability of the multidrug resistant ss rt to remove azt monophosphate aztmp from blocked primers through a nucleotide dependent reaction we show that its higher atp dependent phosphorolytic activity is also detectable with primers terminated with      didehydro   deoxythymidine   monophosphate d tmp or      dideoxythymidine   monophosphate ddtmp  but is significantly reduced when the dipeptide insertion is deleted removal of aztmp d tmp and ddtmp can be inhibited by the next complementary deoxynucleoside triphosphate dntp  aztmp removal reactions catalysed by ss rt were highly resistant to dntp inhibition ic  gt   mm  while unblocking of d tmp and ddtmp terminated primers was around tenfold more sensitive to inhibition by the next complementary dntp both ss and mutant s s rts were able to unblock and extend primers terminated with      dideoxycytidine   monophosphate ddcmp in the presence of atp albeit very poorly under these conditions none of the rts was able to remove      dideoxy   thiacytidine   monophosphate  tcmp from a terminated dna primer resistance mediated by atp dependent phosphorolysis depends on the intracellular levels of dntp high levels as found in transformed cell lines i e h  cem lymphoblasts supt cells etc  may prevent repair of primers terminated with d tmp however atp dependent phosphorolysis could be relevant for d t resistance in cells having low levels of dntps this proposal could explain why insertion containing hiv  variants have been detected in the absence of azt during d t treatment
