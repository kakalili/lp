solution structure and characterisation of the human pyruvate dehydrogenase complex core assembly
mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase complex pdc is a key multi enzyme assembly that is responsible for glucose homeostasis maintenance and conversion of pyruvate into acetyl coa it comprises a central pentagonal dodecahedral core consisting of two subunit types e and e bp to which peripheral enzymes e and e  bind tightly but non covalently currently there are two conflicting models of pdc e e bp core organisation the  addition  model     and the  substitution  model     here we present the first ever low resolution structures of human recombinant full length pdc core re e bp  truncated pdc core te e bp and native bovine heart pdc core be e bp obtained by small angle x ray scattering and small angle neutron scattering these structures corroborated by negative stain and cryo electron microscopy data clearly reveal open pentagonal core faces favouring the  substitution  model of core organisation the native and recombinant core structures are all similar to the truncated bacterial e core crystal structure obtained previously cryo electron microscopy reconstructions of re e bp and re e bp e directly confirm that the core has open pentagonal faces agree with scattering derived models and show density extending outwards from their surfaces which is much more structurally ordered in the presence of e  additionally analytical ultracentrifugation characterisation of re e bp re  full length recombinant e only and te e bp supports the substitution model superimposition of the small angle neutron scattering te e bp and truncated bacterial e crystal structures demonstrates conservation of the overall pentagonal dodecahedral morphology despite evolutionary diversity in addition unfolding studies using circular dichroism and tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy show that the re e bp is less stable than its re counterpart indicative of a role for e bp in core destabilisation the architectural complexity and lower stability of the e e bp core may be of benefit to mammals where sophisticated fine tuning is required for cores with optimal catalytic and regulatory efficiencies
