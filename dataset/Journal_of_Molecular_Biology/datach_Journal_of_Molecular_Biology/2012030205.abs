arginine changes the conformation of the arginine attenuator peptide relative to the ribosome tunnel
the fungal arginine attenuator peptide aap is a regulatory peptide that controls ribosome function as a nascent peptide within the ribosome exit tunnel it acts to stall ribosomes in response to arginine arg  we used three approaches to probe the molecular basis for stalling first pegylation assays revealed that the aap did not undergo overall compaction in the tunnel in response to arg second site specific photocross linking showed that arg altered the conformation of the wild type aap but not of nonfunctional mutants with respect to the tunnel third using time resolved spectral measurements with a fluorescent probe placed in the nascent aap we detected sequence specific changes in the disposition of the aap near the peptidyltransferase center in response to arg these data provide evidence that an arg induced change in aap conformation and or environment in the ribosome tunnel is important for stalling
