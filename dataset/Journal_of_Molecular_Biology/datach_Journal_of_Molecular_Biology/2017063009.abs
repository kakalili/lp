a molecular prospective for hira complex assembly and h  specific histone chaperone function
incorporation of variant histone sequences in addition to post translational modification of histones serves to modulate the chromatin environment different histone chaperone proteins mediate the storage and chromatin deposition of variant histones although the two non centromeric histone h variants h  and h   differ by only  aa replacement of histone h  with h  can modulate the transcription for highly expressed and developmentally required genes lead to the formation of repressive heterochromatin or aid in dna and chromatin repair the human histone cell cycle regulator hira complex composed of hira ubinuclein  cabin  and transiently anti silencing function  forms one of the two complexes that bind and deposit h  h into chromatin a number of recent biochemical and structural studies have revealed important details underlying how these proteins assemble and function together as a multiprotein h  specific histone chaperone complex here we present a review of existing data and present a new model for the assembly of the hira complex and for the hira mediated incorporation of h  h into chromatin
