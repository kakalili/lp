crystal structure and biochemical properties of the human mitochondrial ferritin and its mutant ser  ala
mitochondrial ferritin is a recently identified protein precursor encoded by an intronless gene it is specifically taken up by the mitochondria and processed to a mature protein that assembles into functional ferritin shells the full mature recombinant protein and its s  a mutant were produced to study structural and functional properties they yielded high quality crystals from mg ii solutions which diffracted up to    resolution the d structures of the two proteins resulted very similar to that of human h ferritin to which they have high level of sequence identity      metal binding sites were identified in the native crystals and in those soaked in mn ii and zn ii solutions the ferroxidase center binds binuclear iron at the sites a and b and the structures showed that the a site was always fully occupied by mg ii  mn ii or zn ii  while the occupancy of the b site was variable in addition distinct mg ii and zn ii binding sites were found in the  fold axes to block the hydrophilic channels other metal binding sites never observed before in h ferritin were found on the cavity surface near the ferroxidase center and near the  fold axes mitochondrial ferritin showed biochemical properties remarkably similar to those of human h ferritin except for the difficulty in renaturing to yield ferritin shells and for a reduced     rate in ferroxidase activity this was partially rescued by the substitution of the bulkier ser  with ala which occurs in h ferritin the residue is exposed on a channel that connects the ferroxidase center with the cavity the finding that the mutation increased both catalytic activity and the occupancy of the b site demonstrated that the channel is functionally important in conclusion the present data define the structure of human mitochondrial ferritin and provide new data on the iron pathways within the h type ferritin shell
