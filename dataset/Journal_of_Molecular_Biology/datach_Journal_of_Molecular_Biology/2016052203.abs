structure determination of the nuclear pore complex with three dimensional cryo electron microscopy
determining the structure of the nuclear pore complex npc imposes an enormous challenge due to its size intricate composition and membrane embedded nature in vertebrates about   protein building blocks assemble into a   mda complex that fuses the inner and outer membranes of a cell s nucleus here we review the recent progress in understanding the in situ architecture of the npc with a specific focus on approaches using three dimensional cryo electron microscopy we discuss technological benefits and limitations and give an outlook toward obtaining a high resolution structure of the npc
