the role of the largest rna polymerase subunit lid element in preventing the formation of extended rna dna hybrid
analysis of multi subunit rna polymerase rnap structures revealed several distinct elements that may perform partial functions of the enzyme one such element the  lid   is formed by an evolutionarily conserved segment of the rnap largest subunit    in bacterial rnap  the    lid contacts the nascent rna at the upstream edge of the rna dna hybrid where the rna gets separated from the dna template strand and double stranded upstream dna is formed to test the    lid functions we generated bacterial rnap lacking the lid and studied the mutant enzyme s properties in vitro our results demonstrate that removal of the lid has minimal consequences on transcription elongation from double stranded dna on single stranded dna the mutant rnap generates full sized transcripts that remain annealed to the dna throughout their length in contrast the wild type enzyme produces short    nucleotide transcripts that remain part of the transcription complex but cannot be further elongated the cessation of transcription is apparently triggered by a clash between the lid and the nascent rna   end the results show that the lid s function is redundant in the presence of the non template dna strand which alone can control the proper geometry of nucleic acids at the upstream edge of the transcription complex structural considerations suggest that in the absence of the non template strand and the lid a new channel opens within the rnap molecule that allows continuous dna rna hybrid to exit rnap
