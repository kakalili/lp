how do substrates enter and products exit the buried active site of cytochrome p  cam   steered molecular dynamics and adiabatic mapping of substrate pathways edited by j thornton
three possible channels by which substrates and products can exit from the buried active site of cytochrome p  cam have been identified by means of random expulsion molecular dynamics simulations in the investigation described here we computed estimates of the relative probabilities of ligand passage through the three channels using steered molecular dynamics and adiabatic mapping for comparison the same techniques are also applied to investigate substrate egress from cytochrome p  bm  the channel in cytochrome p  cam for which there is the most supporting evidence from experiments which we name pathway a  is computed to be the most probable ligand exit channel it has the smallest computed unbinding work and force for this channel the ligand exits between the f g loop and the b  helix two mechanistically distinct but energetically similar routes through this channel were observed showing that multiple pathways along one channel are possible the probability of ligand exit via the next most probable channel pathway   which is located between the i helix and the f and g helices is estimated to be less than   of the probability of exit along pathway a low frequency modes of the protein extracted from an essential dynamics analysis of a  ns duration molecular dynamics simulation of cytochrome p  cam with camphor bound support the opening of pathway a on a longer timescale on longer timescales it is therefore expected that this pathway becomes more dominant than estimated from the present computations
