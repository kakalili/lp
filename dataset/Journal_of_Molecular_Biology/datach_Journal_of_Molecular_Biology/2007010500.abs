cooperativeness of the higher chromatin structure of the  globin locus revealed by the deletion mutations of dnase i hypersensitive site  of the lcr
high level transcription of the globin genes requires the enhancement by a distant element the locus control region lcr  such long range regulation in vivo involves spatial interaction between transcriptional elements with intervening chromatin looping out it has been proposed that the clustering of the hs sites of the lcr the active globin genes as well as the remote   hypersensitive sites hss  hs    in mouse hs   in human and   hs forms a specific spatial chromatin structure termed active chromatin hub ach  here we report the effects of the hs deletions of the lcr on the spatial chromatin structure of the  globin locus as revealed by the chromatin conformation capture  c technology the small hs core deletion    kb  but not the large hs deletion    kb  disrupted the spatial interactions among all the hs sites of the lcr the  globin gene and   hs  we have previously demonstrated that the large hs deletion barely impairs the structure of the lcr holocomplex while the structure is significantly disrupted by the hs core deletion taken together these results suggest that the formation of the ach is dependent on a largely intact lcr structure we propose that the ach indeed is an extension of the lcr holocomplex
