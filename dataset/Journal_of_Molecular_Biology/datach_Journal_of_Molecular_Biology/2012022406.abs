subcellular distribution of the human putative nucleolar gtpase gnl is regulated by a novel arginine lysine rich domain and a gtp binding domain in a cell cycle dependent manner
gnl  a putative nucleolar gtpase belongs to the mmr hsr family of large gtpases that are emerging as crucial coordinators of signaling cascades in different cellular compartments members of this family share very closely related g domains but the signals and pathways regulating their subcellular localization with respect to cell growth remain unknown to understand the nuclear transport mechanism of gnl  we have identified a novel arginine lysine rich nucleolar localization signal in the nh terminus that is shown to translocate gnl and a heterologous protein to the nucleus nucleolus in a pathway that is independent of importin  and importin   in addition the present investigation provided evidence that gnl localized to the nucleus and the nucleolus only in g stage in contrast to its cytoplasmic localization in the g and s phases of the cell cycle using heterokaryon assay we have demonstrated that gnl shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and that the motif between amino acids   and   is essential for its export from the nucleus by a signal mediated crm independent pathway alanine scanning mutagenesis of conserved residues within g domains suggests that the g motif is critical for guanine nucleotide triphosphate gtp binding of gnl and further showed that nucleolar retention of gnl is regulated by a gtp gating mediated mechanism expression of wild type gnl promotes g m transition in contrast to the g domain mutant g m  which fails to localize to the nucleolus these data suggest that nucleolar translocation during g phase may be critical for faster m phase transition during cell proliferation replacement of conserved residues within the g motif alters the stability of gnl without changing gtp binding activity finally our data suggest that ongoing transcription is essential for the efficient localization of gnl to the nucleolus overall the results reported here demonstrate that multiple mechanisms are involved in the translocation of gnl to the nucleolus in a cell cycle dependent manner to regulate cell growth and proliferation
