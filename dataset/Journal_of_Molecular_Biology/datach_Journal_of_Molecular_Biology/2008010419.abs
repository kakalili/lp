high resolution structural analysis of mammalian profilin a complex formation with two physiological ligands the formin homology  domain of mdia and the proline rich domain of vasp
profilins are small proteins capable of binding actin poly l proline and other proline rich sequences and phosphatidylinositol    bisphosphate a number of proline rich ligands for profilin have been characterised including proteins of the ena vasp and formin families we have determined the high resolution crystal structures of mouse profilin a in complex with peptides from two functionally important ligands from different families vasp and mdia  the structures show that the binding mode of the peptide ligand is strongly affected by the non proline residues in the sequence and the peptides from vasp and mdia bind to profilin a in distinct modes the high resolution of the crystallographic data allowed us to detect conserved ch  hydrogen bonds between the peptide and profilin in both complexes furthermore both peptides which are shown to have micromolar affinity induced the dimerisation of profilin potentially leading to functionally different ligand profilin  actin complexes the peptides did not significantly affect actin polymerisation kinetics in the presence or in the absence of profilin a mutant profilins were tested for binding to poly l proline and the vasp and mdia peptides and the f  a mutant bound proline rich ligands with near native affinity peptide blotting using a series of designed peptides with profilins  and a indicates differences between the two profilins towards proline rich peptides from mdia and vasp our data provide structural insights into the mechanisms of mdia and vasp regulated actin polymerisation
