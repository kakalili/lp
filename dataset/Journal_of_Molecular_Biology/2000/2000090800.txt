The structure of MTH538, a previously uncharacterized hypothetical protein from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, has been determined by NMR spectroscopy. MTH538 is one of numerous structural genomics targets selected in a genome-wide survey of uncharacterized sequences from this organism. MTH538 is a so-called singleton, a sequence not closely related to any other (known) sequences. The structure of MTH538 closely resembles the known structures of receiver domains from two component response regulator systems, such as CheY, and is similar to the structures of flavodoxins and GTP-binding proteins. Tests on MTH538 for characteristic activities of CheY and flavodoxin were negative. MTH538 did not become phosphorylated in the presence of acetyl phosphate and Mg2+, although it appeared to bind Mg2+. MTH538 also did not bind flavin mononucleotide (FMN) or coenzyme F420. Nevertheless, sequence and structure parallels between MTH538/CheY and two families of ATPase/phosphatase proteins suggest that MTH538 may have a role in a phosphorylation-independent two-component response regulator system.
