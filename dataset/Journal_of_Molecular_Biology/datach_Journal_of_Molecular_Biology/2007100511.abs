a novel proteomic approach identifies new interaction partners for proliferating cell nuclear antigen
during dna replication and repair many proteins bind to and dissociate in a highly specific and ordered manner from proliferating cell nuclear antigen pcna  we describe a combined approach of in silico searches at the genome level and combinatorial peptide synthesis to investigate the binding properties of hundreds of short pcna interacting peptides pip peptides to archaeal and eukaryal pcnas biological relevance of our combined approach was demonstrated by identification an inactive complex of pyrococcus abyssi ribonuclease hii with pcna furthermore we show that pip peptides interact with pcna largely in a sequence independent manner our experimental approach also identified many so far unidentified pcna interacting peptides in a number of human proteins
