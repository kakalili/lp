crystal structure of conserved domains  and  of the human dead box helicase ddx x in complex with the mononucleotide amp
dexd box helicases are involved in all aspects of cellular rna metabolism conserved domains  and  contain nine signature motifs that are responsible for nucleotide binding rna binding and atp hydrolysis the human dead box helicase ddx x has been associated with several different cellular processes such as cell growth control mrna transport and translation and is suggested to be essential for the export of unspliced partially spliced hiv mrnas from the nucleus to the cytoplasm here the crystal structure of conserved domains  and  of ddx x including a ddx specific insertion that is not generally found in human dexd box helicases is presented the n terminal domain  and the c terminal domain  both display reca like folds comprising a central  sheet flanked by  helices interestingly the ddx x specific insertion forms a helical element that extends a highly positively charged sequence in a loop thus increasing the rna binding surface of the protein surprisingly although ddx x was crystallized in the presence of a large excess of adp or the slowly hydrolyzable atp analogue atp s the contaminant amp was seen in the structure a fluorescent based stability assay showed that the thermal stability of ddx x was increased by the mononucleotide amp but not by adp or atp s suggesting that ddx x is stabilized by amp and elucidating why amp was found in the nucleotide binding pocket
