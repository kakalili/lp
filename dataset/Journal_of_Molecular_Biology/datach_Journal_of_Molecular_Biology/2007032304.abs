insights into the structure function of hepatocyte growth factor scatter factor from studies with individual domains
hepatocyte growth factor scatter factor hgf sf  the ligand for the receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by the c met proto oncogene is a multidomain protein structurally related to the pro enzyme plasminogen and with major roles in development tissue regeneration and cancer  we have expressed the n terminal n domain the four kringle domains k to k  and the serine proteinase homology domain sp of hgf sf individually in yeast or mammalian cells and studied their ability to  i bind the met receptor as well as heparan sulphate and dermatan sulphate co receptors  ii activate met in target cells and  iii map their binding sites onto the  propeller domain of met the n k and sp domains bound met directly with comparable affinities kd     and    m  the same domains also bound heparin with decreasing affinities n gt k gt gt sp but only the n domain bound dermatan sulphate three kringle domains k  k and k  displayed agonistic activity on target cells in contrast the n and sp domains although capable of met binding displayed no or little activity further cross linking experiments demonstrated that both the n domain and kringles   bind the  chain moiety amino acid residues      of the met  propeller in summary the k  k and k domains of hgf sf are sufficient for met activation whereas the n and sp domains are not although the latter domains contribute additional binding sites necessary for receptor activation by full length hgf sf the results provide new insights into the structure function of hgf sf and a basis for engineering the n and k domains as receptor antagonists for cancer therapy
