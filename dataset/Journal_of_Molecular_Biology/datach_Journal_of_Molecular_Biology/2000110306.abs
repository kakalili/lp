the mitochondrial import receptor tom  identification of a  kda core domain with a specific binding site for preproteins edited by m yaniv
the mitochondrial import receptor of  kda tom  preferentially recognizes precursors of membrane proteins with internal targeting signals we report the identification of a stably folded  kda core domain located in the middle portion of tom  that contains two of the seven tetratricopeptide repeat motifs of the receptor the core domain binds non cleavable and cleavable preproteins carrying internal targeting signals with a specificity indistinguishable from the full length receptor competition studies indicate that both types of preproteins interact with overlapping binding sites of the core domain and that at least one additional interaction site is present in the full length receptor we suggest a model of tom  function in import of membrane proteins whereby a hydrophobic preprotein concomitantly interacts with several binding sites of the receptor
