a novel two domain architecture within the amino acid kinase enzyme family revealed by the crystal structure of escherichia coli glutamate  kinase
glutamate  kinase g k makes the highly unstable product glutamyl  phosphate g p in the initial controlling step of proline ornithine synthesis being feedback inhibited by proline or ornithine and causing when defective clinical hyperammonaemia we determined two crystal structures of g k from escherichia coli at     and     resolution complexed with glutamate and sulphate or with g p sulphate and the proline analogue  oxoproline e coli g k presents a novel tetrameric dimer of dimers architecture each subunit contains a   residue aak domain typical of acylphosphate forming enzymes with characteristic      sandwich topology this domain is responsible for catalysis and proline inhibition and has a crater on the  sheet c edge that hosts the active centre and bound  oxoproline each subunit contains a  residue c terminal pua domain typical of rna modifying enzymes which presents the characteristic    sandwich fold and three  helices the aak and pua domains of one subunit associate non canonically in the dimer with the same domains of the other subunit leaving a negatively charged hole between them that hosts two mg ions in one crystal in line with the g k requirement for free mg the tetramer formed by two dimers interacting exclusively through their aak domains is flat and elongated and has in each face pericentrically two exposed active centres in alternate subunits this would permit the close apposition of two active centres of bacterial glutamate  phosphate reductase the next enzyme in the proline ornithine synthesising route  supporting the postulated channelling of g p the structures clarify substrate binding and catalysis justify the high glutamate specificity explain the effects of known point mutations and support the binding of proline near glutamate proline binding may trigger the movement of a loop that encircles glutamate and which participates in a hydrogen bond network connecting active centres which is possibly involved in the cooperativity for glutamate
