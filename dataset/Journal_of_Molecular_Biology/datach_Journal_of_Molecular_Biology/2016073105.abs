noncanonical myo b rhogap accelerates rhoa gtp hydrolysis by a dual arginine finger mechanism
the gtp hydrolysis activities of rho gtpases are stimulated by gtpase activating proteins gaps  which contain a rhogap domain equipped with a characteristic arginine finger and an auxiliary asparagine for catalysis however the auxiliary asparagine is missing in the rhogap domain of myo b myo b rhogap  a unique motorized rhogap that specifically targets rhoa for controlling cell motility here we determined the structure of myo b rhogap in complex with gdp bound rhoa and magnesium fluoride unexpectedly myo b rhogap contains two arginine fingers at its catalytic site the first arginine finger resembles the one within the canonical rhogap domains and inserts into the nucleotide binding pocket of rhoa whereas the second arginine finger anchors the switch i loop of rhoa and interacts with the nucleotide stabilizing the transition state of gtp hydrolysis and compensating for the lack of the asparagine mutating either of the two arginine fingers impaired the catalytic activity of myo b rhogap and affected the myo b mediated cell migration our data indicate that myo b rhogap accelerates rhoa gtp hydrolysis by a previously unknown dual arginine finger mechanism which may be shared by other noncanonical rhogap domains lacking the auxiliary asparagine
