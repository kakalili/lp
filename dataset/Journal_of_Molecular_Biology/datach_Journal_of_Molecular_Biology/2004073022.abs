trapping the on pathway folding intermediate of im at equilibrium
the four helical protein im folds via a rapidly formed on pathway intermediate kui   s   at ph      c that contains three helices i ii and iv of the four native  helices the relatively slow kin   s   conversion of this intermediate into the native structure is driven by the folding and docking of the six residue helix iii onto the developing hydrophobic core here we describe the structural properties of four im  variants designed to trap the protein in the intermediate state by disrupting the stabilising interactions formed between helix iii and the rest of the protein structure in two of these variants i a and l ai a  hydrophobic residues within helix iii have been mutated to alanine whilst in the other two mutants the sequence encompassing the native helix iii was replaced by a glycine linker three h g  or six h g  residues in length all four variants were shown to be monomeric as judged by analytical ultracentrifugation and highly helical as measured by far uv cd in addition all the variants denature co operatively and have a stability  guf and buried hydrophobic surface area muf similar to those of the on pathway kinetic intermediate structural characterisation of these variants using  anilino  napthalene sulphonic acid ans binding near uv cd and d h nmr demonstrate further that the trapped intermediate ensemble is highly structured with little exposed hydrophobic surface area interestingly however the structural properties of the variants i a and l ai a differ in detail from those of h g and h g  in particular the single tryptophan residue located near the end of helix iv and distant from helix iii is in a distinct environment in the two sets of mutants as judged by fluorescence near uv cd and the sensitivity of tryptophan fluorescence to iodide quenching overall the results confirm previous kinetic analysis that demonstrated the hierarchical folding of im via an on pathway intermediate and show that this species is a highly helical ensemble with a well formed hydrophobic core by contrast with the native state however the intermediate ensemble is flexible enough to change in response to mutation its structural properties being tailored by residues in the sequence encompassing the native helix iii
