the ribosomal grip of the peptidyl trna is critical for reading frame maintenance
if a ribosome shifts to an alternative reading frame during translation the information in the message is usually lost we have selected mutants of salmonella typhimurium with alterations in trnacmo uggpro that cause increased frameshifting when present in the ribosomal p site in   such mutants two parts of the trna molecule are altered the anticodon stem and the d arm including its tertiary interactions with the variable arm some of these alterations in trnacmo uggpro are in close proximity to ribosomal components in the p site the crystal structure of the  s subunit suggests that the c terminal end of ribosomal protein s contacts nucleotides     of peptidyl trna we have isolated mutants with defects in the c terminus of s that induce  frameshifting combinations of changes in trnacmo uggpro and s suggest that an interaction occurs between position  of the peptidyl trna and the c terminal end of s  together our results suggest that the cause of frameshifting is an aberrant interaction between the peptidyl trna and the p site environment we suggest that the  ribosomal grip  of the peptidyl trna is pivotal for maintaining the reading frame
