structure of an archaeal homolog of the human protein complex rpp   rpp  that is a key core component for the assembly of active ribonuclease p
ribonuclease p rnase p is a ribonucleoprotein complex involved in the processing of the   leader sequence of precursor trna human rnase p protein subunits rpp  and rpp  which bind to each other with catalytic rna h rna are sufficient for activating endonucleolytic cleavage of precursor trna here we have determined the crystal structure of the complex between the pyrococcus horikoshii rnase p proteins phorpp  and phorpp  the archaeal homologs of rpp  and rpp  respectively phorpp  and phorpp  form a heterodimeric structure where the two n terminal helices   and   in phorpp  predominantly interact with the n terminal extended structure the  strand    and the c terminal helix    in phorpp  the interface is dominated by hydrogen bonds and several salt bridges rather than hydrophobic interactions the electrostatic potential on the surface of the heterodimer shows a positively charged cluster on one face suggesting a possible rna binding surface of the phorpp   phorpp  complex the present structure along with the result of a mutational analysis suggests that heterodimerization between phorpp  and phorpp  plays an important role in the function of p horikoshii rnase p
