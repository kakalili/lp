structure of functional single aqp channels in phospholipid membranes
aquaporin  aqp  is the most prevalent intrinsic protein in the plasma membrane of lens fiber cells where it functions as a water selective channel and also participates in fiber  fiber adhesion we report the d envelope of purified aqp reconstituted with random orientation in phospholipid bilayers as single particles the envelope was obtained by combining freeze fracture shadowing and random conical tilt electron microscopy followed by single particle image processing two dimensional analysis of   untilted images produced eight class averages exhibiting  square  and  octagonal  shapes with a continuum of variation we reconstructed in d five class averages that best described the data set the reconstructions   molds   appeared as metal cups exhibiting external and internal surfaces we used the internal surface of the mold to calculate the  imprints  that represent the aqp particles protruding from the hydrophobic core of the phospholipid bilayer the complete envelope of the channel formed by joining the square and octagonal imprints described accurately the size shape oligomeric state orientation and molecular weight of the aqp channel inserted in the phospholipid bilayer rigid body docking of the atomic model of the aquaporin  aqp  tetramer showed that the freeze fracture envelope accounted for the conserved transmembrane domain     similarity between aqp and aqp  but not for the amino and carboxyl termini we suggest that the discrepancy might reflect differences in the location of the amino and carboxyl termini in the crystal and in the phospholipid bilayer
