the c terminal extension of the small gtpase ran is essential for defining the gdp bound form
the small gtpase ran controls cellular processes by interacting with members of the importin  family that bind specifically to the gtp bound form of ran and this regulates the interaction between importin  like proteins and cellular factors the structures of rangdp and rangtp are markedly different and major structural changes are found in the switch i and switch ii regions and in the c terminal extension of ran here we show that a deletion mutant of ran lacking the entire c terminal extension termed ran core can bind to importin  in its gdp bound form with high affinity the ability of ran coregdp to dissociate cargo from importin  results in an import block in digitonin permeabilized cells and leads to microtubule aster formation in mitotic xenopus egg extract as for importin   also transportin importin  and exportin t can no longer discriminate efficiently between the two nucleotide bound forms of ran core in contrast a significant reduction in affinity of the rangdp binding protein ntf for ran coregdp is observed indicating that the switch regions have changed conformation in the ran core mutant our results demonstrate that the c terminus of ran is a major determinant of the state of ran and that removal of this allows the gdp bound form to adopt a gtp like conformation thereby creating a constitutively active protein
