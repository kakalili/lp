the membrane associated form of the dna repair protein ku is involved in cell adhesion to fibronectin
the ku heterodimer ku  ku  plays a central role in dna double strand breaks recognition and repair however ku is expressed also on the surface of different types of cells along with its intracellular pool within the nucleus and the cytoplasm participation of membrane associated ku in cell  cell interaction has been reported recently here we describe a novel function of cell surface ku as an adhesion receptor for fibronectin fn  the role of ku in cell adhesion was investigated by comparing the ku  deficient chinese hamster ovary cho cell line xrs  with clones transfected stably with either the hamster or human ku  cdna ku expression in transfectant cells resulted in a significant increased adhesion on fn and type iv collagen as compared to control cells the observed increase in cell adhesion relied on ku cell surface expression since antibodies directed against ku  or ku  subunit inhibited adhesion on fn of ku  but not control vector transfected xrs  cells in addition both ku  and ku  present a structural relationship with integrin i or a domains and the a and a domains of von willebrand factor domains known to be involved in fn binding both ku  and ku  exhibit a complete set of residues compatible in their position and chemical nature with the formation of a metal ion dependent adhesion midas site implicated in ligand binding and integrin activation taken together these functional and structural approaches support a new role for ku as an adhesion receptor for fn
