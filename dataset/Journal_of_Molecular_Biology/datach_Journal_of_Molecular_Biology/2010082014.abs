novel protein  protein contacts facilitate mrna   processing signal recognition by rna  and hrp
precise   end processing of mrna is essential for correct gene expression yet in yeast    processing signals consist of multiple ambiguous sequence elements two neighboring elements upstream of the cleavage site are particularly important for the accuracy positioning element and efficiency efficiency element of   processing and are recognized by the rna binding proteins rna  and hrp  respectively in vivo these interactions are strengthened by the scaffolding protein rna  that stabilizes their association the nmr structure of the   kda ternary complex of the rna recognition motif rrm domains of hrp and rna  bound to this pair of rna elements was determined by residual dipolar coupling and paramagnetic relaxation experiments it reveals how each of the proteins binds to rna and introduces a novel class of protein  protein contact in regions of previously unknown function these interdomain contacts had previously been overlooked in other multi rrm structures although a careful analysis suggests that they may be frequently present mutations in the regions of these contacts disrupt   end processing suggesting that they may structurally organize the ribonucleoprotein complexes responsible for rna processing
