the central portion of factor h modules     is compact and contains a structurally deviant ccp module
the first eight and the last two of  complement control protein ccp modules within complement factor h fh encompass binding sites for c b and polyanionic carbohydrates these binding sites cooperate self surface selectively to prevent c b amplification thus minimising complement mediated damage to host intervening fh ccps apparently devoid of such recognition sites are proposed to play a structural role one suggestion is that the generally small ccps     connected by longer than average linkers act as a flexible tether between the two functional ends of fh another is that the long linkers induce a    bend in the middle of fh to test these hypotheses we determined the nmr derived structure of fh    consisting of module   shown here to have an archetypal ccp structure and module   which is uniquely short and features a laterally protruding helix like insertion that contributes to a prominent electropositive patch the unusually long fh    linker is not flexible it packs between the two ccps that are not folded back on each other but form a shallow vee shape analytical ultracentrifugation and x ray scattering supported this finding these two techniques additionally indicate that flanking modules within fh    and fh     are at least as rigid and tilted relative to neighbours as are ccps  and  with respect to one another tilts between successive modules are not unidirectional their principal axes trace a zigzag path in one of two arrangements for ccps     that fit well with scattering data ccp  is folded back onto ccp   in conclusion fh    forms neither a flexible tether nor a smooth bend rather it is compact and has embedded within it a ccp module ccp   that appears to be highly specialised given both its deviant structure and its striking surface charge distribution a passive purely structural role for this central portion of fh is unlikely
