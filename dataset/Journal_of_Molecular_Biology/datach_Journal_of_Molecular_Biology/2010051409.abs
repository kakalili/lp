molecular basis for the high degree of antigenic cross reactivity between hepatitis b virus capsids hbcag and dimeric capsid related protein hbeag  insights into the enigmatic nature of the e antigen
the hepatitis b virus core gene codes for two closely related antigens a  kda protein that forms dimers that assemble as multimegadalton capsids and a  kda protein that also forms dimers but that do not assemble the proteins respectively referred to as core antigen hbcag and e antigen hbeag  share a sequence of   residues but have different amino and carboxy termini their structural and serological relationship has long been unclear with insights gained from recent structural studies on immune complexes of the capsids the relationship was reassessed using recombinant forms of the antigens and a panel of monoclonal antibodies mabs commonly believed to discriminate between core and e antigen surface plasmon resonance spr was used to measure the affinities in contrast to previous studies that used more error prone and less sensitive plate type assays four of the six mabs did not discriminate between core and e antigen nor did they discriminate between e antigen and dimers of dissociated core antigen capsids one mab    was specific for assembled capsids and one e  was specific for unassembled dimers epitope valency of the e antigen was also studied using a sandwich spr assay where e antigen was captured with one mab and probed with a second the e antigen is often considered to be a monomeric protein on the basis of monovalent reactivity with antibody pairs specific for either an  or  epitope in a prior nomenclature for e antigen specificity  this model however is incorrect because recombinant e antigen is a stable dimer and its apparent monovalency is due to steric blockage this was proven by the formation of a   fab e  e antigen complex these results suggest new approaches for the isolation of the authentic e antigen its biological assay and its stabilization as an immune complex for structural studies
