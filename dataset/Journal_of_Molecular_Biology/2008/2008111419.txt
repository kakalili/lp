Prefoldin (PFD) is a heterohexameric molecular chaperone that is found in eukaryotic cytosol and archaea. PFD is composed of α and β subunits and forms a “jellyfish-like” structure. PFD binds and stabilizes nascent polypeptide chains and transfers them to group II chaperonins for completion of their folding. Recently, the whole genome of Thermococcus kodakaraensis KOD1 was reported and shown to contain the genes of two α and two β subunits of PFD. The genome of Thermococcus strain KS-1 also possesses two sets of α (α1 and α2) and β subunits (β1 and β2) of PFD (TsPFD). However, the functions and roles of each of these PFD subunits have not been investigated in detail. Here, we report the crystal structure of the TsPFD β1 subunit at 1.9 Å resolution and its functional analysis. TsPFD β1 subunits form a tetramer with four coiled-coil tentacles resembling the jellyfish-like structure of heterohexameric PFD. The β hairpin linkers of β1 subunits assemble to form a β barrel “body” around a central fourfold axis. Size-exclusion chromatography and multi-angle light-scattering analyses show that the β1 subunits form a tetramer at pH 8.0 and a dimer of tetramers at pH 6.8. The tetrameric β1 subunits can protect against aggregation of relatively small proteins, insulin or lysozyme. The structural and biochemical analyses imply that PFD β1 subunits act as molecular chaperones in living cells of some archaea.
