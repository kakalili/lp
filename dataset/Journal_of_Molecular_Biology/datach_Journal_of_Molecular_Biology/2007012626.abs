recognition of rantes by extracellular parts of the ccr receptor
the chemokine rantes regulated upon activation normal t cell expressed and secreted is a natural ligand of ccr  one of the major hiv  coreceptors it is secreted as part of the immune response to human immunodeficiency virus  hiv  and inhibits infection by ccr dependent r  hiv  isolates we have investigated the interaction of rantes with several peptides derived from the extracellular domains of ccr by heteronuclear nmr spectroscopy in aqueous solution we show that a peptide comprising the first  amino acid residues of the ccr n terminal domain and sulfated at the y  and y  side chains binds with micromolar affinity exclusively to the monomeric form of rantes in contrast to the tight binding of the sulfated peptide the affinity of the same peptide in non sulfated form was reduced by more than two orders of magnitude peptides derived from the ccr extracellular loops ecl  ecl and ecl showed only very moderate and mostly non specific binding chemical shift mapping of the interaction of the sulfated n terminal peptide reveals a contiguous binding surface on rantes which comprises amino acid residues of the first  strand the n loop the fourth  strand and the turns around residues  and   this binding surface largely overlaps with the dimer interface and is strongly positively charged providing a rationale for the exclusive binding of the monomer to the peptide and the requirement of the negative sulfate groups at the y  and y  side chains the binding surface also largely overlaps with the segments that were identified previously as crucial for hiv blockade by peptide scanning and mutagenesis studies these data offer new insights into the structure  function relation of the rantes  ccr interaction and may be helpful for the design of novel hiv  inhibitors
