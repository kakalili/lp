crystal structure of hel  a soluble refoldable human vh single domain with a germ line scaffold
the antigen binding site of antibodies usually comprises associated heavy vh and light vl chain variable domains but in camels and llamas the binding site frequently comprises the heavy chain variable domain only referred to as vhh  in contrast to reported human vh domains vhh domains are well expressed from bacteria and yeast are readily purified in soluble form and refold reversibly after heat denaturation these desirable properties have been attributed to highly conserved substitutions of the hydrophobic residues of vh domains which normally interact with complementary vl domains here we describe the discovery and characterisation of an isolated human vh domain hel  with properties similar to those of vhh domains hel is highly soluble at concentrations of   mm essentially monomeric and resistant to aggregation upon thermodenaturation at concentrations as high as   m however in contrast to vhh domains the hydrophobic framework residues of the vh vl interface are maintained and the only sequence changes from the corresponding human germ line segment v   dp   are located in the loops comprising the complementarity determining regions cdrs  the crystallographic structure of hel reveals an unusual feature the side chain of a framework residue trp  is flipped into a cavity formed by gly  of cdr  thereby increasing the hydrophilicity of the vh vl interface to evaluate the specific contribution of gly  to domain properties gly  was introduced into a vh domain with poor solution properties this greatly enhanced the recovery of the mutant from a gel filtration matrix but had little effect on its ability to refold reversibly after heat denaturation our results confirm the importance of a hydrophilic vh vl interface for purification of isolated vh domains and constitute a step towards the design of isolated human vh domains with practical properties for immunotherapy
