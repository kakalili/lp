a divalent cation stabilizes the active conformation of the b subtilis rnase p pre trna complex a role for an inner sphere metal ion in rnase p
metal ions interact with rna to enhance folding stabilize structure and in some cases facilitate catalysis assigning functional roles to specifically bound metal ions presents a major challenge in analyzing the catalytic mechanisms of ribozymes bacillus subtilis ribonuclease p rnase p  composed of a catalytically active rna subunit prna and a small protein subunit p protein  catalyzes the   end maturation of precursor trnas pre trnas  inner sphere coordination of divalent metal ions to prna is essential for catalytic activity but not for the formation of the rnase p pre trna enzyme  substrate es complex previous studies have demonstrated that this es complex undergoes an essential conformational change to the es  conformer before the cleavage step here we show that the es  conformer is stabilized by a high affinity divalent cation capable of inner sphere coordination such as ca ii or mg ii  additionally a second lower affinity mg ii activates cleavage catalyzed by rnase p structural changes that occur upon binding ca ii to the es complex were determined by time resolved f rster resonance energy transfer measurements of the distances between donor  acceptor fluorophores introduced at specific locations on the p protein and pre trna   leader these data demonstrate that the   leader of pre trna moves  to    closer to the prna p protein interface during the es to es  transition and suggest that the metal dependent conformational change reorganizes the bound substrate in the active site to form a catalytically competent es  complex
