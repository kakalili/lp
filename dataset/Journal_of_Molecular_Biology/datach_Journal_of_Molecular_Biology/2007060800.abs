monomeric restriction endonuclease bcni in the apo form and in an asymmetric complex with target dna
restriction endonuclease bcni cleaves duplex dna containing the sequence cc sgg s stands for c or g  designates a cleavage position to generate staggered products with single nucleotide   overhangs here we show that bcni functions as a monomer that interacts with its target dna in   molar ratio and report crystal structures of bcni in the absence and in the presence of dna in the complex with dna bcni makes specific contacts with all five bases of the target sequence and not just with a half site as the protomer of a typical dimeric restriction endonuclease our data are inconsistent with bcni dimerization and suggest that the enzyme introduces double strand breaks by sequentially nicking individual dna strands although this remains to be confirmed by kinetic experiments bcni is remotely similar to the dna repair protein muth and shares approximately   sequence identity with the restriction endonuclease mvai which is specific for the related sequence cc wgg w stands for a or t  as expected bcni is structurally similar to mvai and recognizes conserved bases in the target sequence similarly but not identically bcni has a unique machinery for the recognition of the central base pair
