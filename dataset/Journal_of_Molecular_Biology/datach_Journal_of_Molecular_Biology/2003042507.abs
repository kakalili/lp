mechanism of proton transport in bacteriorhodopsin from crystallographic structures of the k l m  m  and m   intermediates of the photocycle
we produced the l intermediate of the photocycle in a bacteriorhodopsin crystal in photo stationary state at  k with red laser illumination at   occupancy and determined its structure to    resolution with this model high resolution structural information is available for the initial bacteriorhodopsin as well as the first five states in the transport cycle these states involve photo isomerization of the retinal and its initial configurational changes deprotonation of the retinal schiff base and the coupled release of a proton to the extracellular membrane surface and the switch event that allows reprotonation of the schiff base from the cytoplasmic side the six structural models describe the transformations of the retinal and its interaction with water   asp  and asp  in atomic detail as well as the displacements of functional residues farther from the schiff base the changes provide rationales for how relaxation of the distorted retinal causes movements of water and protein atoms that result in vectorial proton transfers to and from the schiff base
