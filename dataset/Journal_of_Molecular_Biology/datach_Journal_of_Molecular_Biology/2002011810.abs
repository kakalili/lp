solution structure and functional analysis of the cysteine rich c domain of kinase suppressor of ras ksr  edited by p e wright
kinase suppressor of ras ksr is a conserved component of the ras pathway that acts as a molecular scaffold to promote signal transmission from raf  to mek and mapk all ksr proteins contain a conserved cysteine rich c domain and studies have implicated this domain in the regulation of ksr subcellular localization and function to further elucidate the biological role of the ksr c domain we have determined its three dimensional solution structure using nuclear magnetic resonance nmr  we find that while the overall topology of the ksr c domain is similar to the c domains of raf  and pkc  the predicted ligand binding region and the surface charge distribution are unique moreover by generating chimeric proteins in which these domains have been swapped we find that the c domains of raf  pkc  and ksr are not functionally interchangeable the ksr c domain does not bind with high affinity or respond biologically to phorbol esters or ceramide and it does not interact directly with ras indicating that the putative ligand s for the ksr c domain are distinct from those that interact with pkc  and raf  in addition our analysis of the chimeric proteins supports the model that raf  is a ceramide activated kinase and that its c domain is involved in the ceramide mediated response finally our findings demonstrate an absolute requirement of the ksr c domain in mediating the membrane localization of ksr  a crucial feature of its scaffolding activity together these results underscore the functional specificity of these important regulatory domains and demonstrate that the structural features of the c domains can provide valuable insight into their ligand binding properties
