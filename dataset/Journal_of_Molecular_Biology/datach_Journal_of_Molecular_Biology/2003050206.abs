the mechanism of interaction of sweet proteins with the t r t r receptor evidence from the solution structure of g a mnei
the mechanism by which sweet proteins elicit a response on the t r t r sweet taste receptor is still mostly unknown but has been so far related to the presence of  sweet fingers  on the protein surface able to interact with the same mechanism as that of low molecular mass sweeteners in the search for the identification of sweet fingers we have solved the solution structure of g a mnei a structural mutant that shows a reduction of one order of magnitude in sweetness with respect to its parent protein mnei a single chain monellin comparison of the structures of wild type monellin and its g a mutant shows that the mutation does not affect the structure of potential glucophores but produces a distortion of the surface owing to the partial relative displacement of elements of secondary structure these results show conclusively that sweet proteins do not possess a sweet finger and strongly support the hypothesis that the mechanism of interaction of sweet tasting proteins with the recently identified t r t r gpc receptor is different from that of low molecular mass sweeteners
