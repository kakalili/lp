crystal structure of the major allergen from fire ant venom sol i
fire ant venom is an extremely potent allergy inducing agent containing four major allergens sol i  to sol i  which are the most frequent cause of hypersensitivity reactions to hymenoptera in the southern usa the crystal structure of recombinant baculovirus major fire ant allergen sol i  has been determined to a resolution of     by the method of molecular replacement the secondary structure elements of sol i  are arranged in an       sandwich fold consisting of a central antiparallel  sheet surrounded on both sides by  helices the overall structure is very similar to that of the homologous wasp venom allergen ves v  with major differences occurring in the solvent exposed loop regions that contain amino acid insertions consequently the limited conservation of surface chemical properties and topology between sol i  and ves v  may explain the observed lack of relevant cross reactivity it is concluded that sol i  recognizes immunoglobulin e antibodies with a distinct set of its own epitopes which are different from those of ves v  indeed the molecular area in sol i  covered by non conserved residues is large enough to accommodate four unique sol i  epitopes
