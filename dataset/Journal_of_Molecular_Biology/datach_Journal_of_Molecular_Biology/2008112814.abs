stability and atp binding of the nucleotide binding domain of the wilson disease protein effect of the common h  q mutation
perturbation of the human copper transporter wilson disease protein atp b causes intracellular copper accumulation and severe pathology known as wilson disease wd  several wd mutations are clustered within the nucleotide binding subdomain n domain  including the most common mutation h  q to gain insight into the biophysical behavior of the n domain under normal and disease conditions we have characterized wild type and h  q recombinant n domains in vitro and in silico the mutant has only twofold lower atp affinity compared to that of the wild type n domain both proteins unfold in an apparent two state reaction at    c and atp stabilizes the folded state the thermal unfolding reactions are irreversible and for the same scan rate the wild type protein is more resistant to perturbation than the mutant for both proteins atp increases the activation barrier towards thermal denaturation molecular dynamics simulations identify specific differences in both atp orientation and protein structure that can explain the absence of catalytic activity for the mutant n domain taken together our results provide biophysical characteristics that may be general to n domains in other p b atpases as well as identify changes that may be responsible for the h  q wd phenotype in vivo
