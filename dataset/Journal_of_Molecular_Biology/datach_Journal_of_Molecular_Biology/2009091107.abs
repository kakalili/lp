ezrin induces long range interdomain allostery in the scaffolding protein nherf
scaffolding proteins are molecular switches that control diverse signaling events the scaffolding protein na h exchanger regulatory factor  nherf  assembles macromolecular signaling complexes and regulates the macromolecular assembly localization and intracellular trafficking of a number of membrane ion transport proteins receptors and adhesion antiadhesion proteins nherf begins with two modular protein  protein interaction domains  pdz and pdz  and ends with a c terminal ct domain this ct domain binds to ezrin which in turn interacts with cytosekeletal actin remarkably ezrin binding to nherf increases the binding capabilities of both pdz domains here we use deuterium labeling and contrast variation neutron scattering experiments to determine the conformational changes in nherf when it forms a complex with ezrin upon binding to ezrin nherf undergoes significant conformational changes in the region linking pdz and its ct ezrin binding domain as well as in the region linking pdz and pdz  involving very long range interactions over     the results provide a structural explanation at mesoscopic scales of the allosteric control of nherf by ezrin as it assembles protein complexes because of the essential roles of nherf and ezrin in intracellular trafficking in epithelial cells we hypothesize that this long range allosteric regulation of nherf by ezrin enables the membrane  cytoskeleton to assemble protein complexes that control cross talk and regulate the strength and duration of signaling
