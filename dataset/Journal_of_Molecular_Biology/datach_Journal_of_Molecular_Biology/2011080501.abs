structural and computational investigations of vim  insights into the substrate specificity of vim metallo  lactamases
the presence of metallo  lactamases mbls in many clinically important human bacterial pathogens limits treatment options as these enzymes efficiently hydrolyze nearly all  lactam antibiotics vim enzymes are among the most widely distributed mbls but many of the individual vim subtypes remain poorly characterized pseudomonas aeruginosa vim  is the most divergent among vim type mbls in terms of amino acid sequence here we present crystal structures of vim  as the native enzyme with cys  oxidized vim  ox  and with a sulfur atom bridging the two active site zinc ions vim  s  comparison with vim  and vim  structures suggests an explanation for the reduced catalytic efficiency of vim  against cephalosporins with a positively charged cyclic substituent at the c position e g  ceftazidime  kinetic variations are attributed to substitutions in residues     that form a loop adjacent to the active site previously implicated in substrate binding and to the disruption of two hydrogen bonding clusters through substitutions at positions   and   furthermore the less negatively charged surface of vim  compared to vim  may also contribute to the reduced hydrolytic efficiency docking of the cephalosporins ceftazidime and cefotaxime into the vim  and vim  structures reveals that amino acid substitutions may cause the mode of substrate binding to differ between the two enzymes our structures thus provide new insights into the variation in substrate specificity that is evident across this family of clinically important enzymes
