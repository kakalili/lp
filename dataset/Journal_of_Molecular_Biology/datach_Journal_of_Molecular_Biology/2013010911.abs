indirect readout of dna sequence by p  repressor roles of dna and protein functional groups in modulating dna conformation
the repressor of bacteriophage p  p r discriminates between its various dna binding sites by sensing the identity of non contacted base pairs at the center of its binding site the  indirect readout  of these non contacted bases is apparently based on dna s sequence dependent conformational preferences the structures of p r  dna complexes indicate that the non contacted base pairs at the center of the binding site are in the b  state this finding suggests that indirect readout and therefore binding site discrimination depend on p r s ability to either sense and or impose the b  state on the non contacted bases of its binding sites we show here that the affinity of binding sites for p r depends on the tendency of the central bases to assume the b  dna state furthermore we identify functional groups in the minor groove of the non contacted bases as the essential modulators of indirect readout by p r in p r  dna complexes the negatively charged e  and e  residues are provocatively positioned near the negatively charged dna phosphates of the non contacted nucleotides the close proximity of the negatively charged groups on protein and dna suggests that electrostatics may play a key role in the indirect readout process changing either of two negatively charged residues to uncharged residues eliminates the ability of p r to impose structural changes on dna and to recognize non contacted base sequence these findings suggest that these negatively charged amino acids function to force the p r bound dna into the b  state and therefore play a key role in indirect readout by p r
