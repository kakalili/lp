statistical mechanics of monod  wyman  changeux mwc models
the  th anniversary of the classic monod  wyman  changeux mwc model provides an opportunity to survey the broader conceptual and quantitative implications of this quintessential biophysical model with the use of statistical mechanics the mathematical implementation of the mwc concept links problems that seem otherwise to have no ostensible biological connection including ligand  receptor binding ligand gated ion channels chemotaxis chromatin structure and gene regulation hence a thorough mathematical analysis of the mwc model can illuminate the performance limits of a number of unrelated biological systems in one stroke the goal of our review is twofold first we describe in detail the general physical principles that are used to derive the activity of mwc molecules as a function of their regulatory ligands second we illustrate the power of ideas from information theory and dynamical systems for quantifying how well the output of mwc molecules tracks their sensory input giving a sense of the  design  constraints faced by these receptors
