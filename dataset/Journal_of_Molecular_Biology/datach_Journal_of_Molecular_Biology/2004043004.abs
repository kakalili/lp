evidence against reciprocal recombination as the basis for tuf gene conversion in salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium
the duplicate tuf genes on the salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium chromosome co evolve by a reca  recb dependent gene conversion mechanism gene conversion is defined as a non reciprocal transfer of genetic information however in a replicating bacterial chromosome there is a possibility that a reciprocal genetic exchange between different tuf genes sitting on sister chromosomes could result in  apparent  gene conversion we asked whether the major mechanism of tuf gene conversion was classical or apparent we devised a genetic selection that allowed us to isolate and examine both expected products from a reciprocal recombination event between the tuf genes using this selection we tested within individual cultures for a correlation in the frequency of jackpots as expected if recombination were reciprocal we found no correlation either in the frequency of each type of recombinant product or in the dna sequences of the products resulting from each recombination event we conclude that the evidence argues in favor of a non reciprocal gene conversion mechanism as the basis for tuf gene co evolution
