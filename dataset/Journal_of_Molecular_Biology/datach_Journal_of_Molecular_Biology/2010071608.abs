high resolution crystal structures of drosophila melanogaster angiotensin converting enzyme in complex with novel inhibitors and antihypertensive drugs
angiotensin i converting enzyme ace  one of the central components of the renin  angiotensin system is a key therapeutic target for the treatment of hypertension and cardiovascular disorders human somatic ace sace has two homologous domains n and c  the n and c domain catalytic sites have different activities toward various substrates moreover some of the undesirable side effects of the currently available and widely used ace inhibitors may arise from their targeting both domains leading to defects in other pathways in addition structural studies have shown that although both these domains have much in common at the inhibitor binding site there are significant differences and these are greater at the peptide binding sites than regions distal to the active site as a model system we have used an ace homologue from drosophila melanogaster ance a single domain protein with ace activity to study ace inhibitor binding in an extensive study we present high resolution structures for native ance and in complex with six known antihypertensive drugs a novel c domain sace specific inhibitor lisw s and two sace domain specific phosphinic peptidyl inhibitors rxpa  and rxp   i e  nine structures  these structures show detailed binding features of the inhibitors and highlight subtle changes in the orientation of side chains at different binding pockets in the active site in comparison with the active site of n and c domains of sace this study provides information about the structure  activity relationships that could be utilized for designing new inhibitors with improved domain selectivity for sace
