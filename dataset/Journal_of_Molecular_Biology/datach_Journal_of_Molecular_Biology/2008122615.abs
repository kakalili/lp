a new regulatory mechanism of nf  b activation by i  b  in cancer cells
transglutaminase  tgase  catalyzes covalent isopeptide bond formation between glutamine and lysine residues recently we reported that tgase  activates nuclear factor kappa b nf  b by depleting inhibitor of nf  b  i  b  levels via polymer formation furthermore tgase  expression synergistically increases nf  b activity with canonical pathway the major i  b proteins such as i  b  and i  b  resemble each other in both primary sequence and tertiary structure however i  b  does not degrade fully while i  b  degrades immediately in response to most stimuli we found that i  b  does not contain any of the previously identified tgase  target sites in this study both an in vitro cross linking assay and a tgase  transfection assay revealed that i  b  is independent from tgase  mediated polymerization furthermore increased i  b  expression reversed nf  b activation in cancer cells compensating for the loss of i  b  via tgase  polymerization
