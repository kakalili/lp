probing non selective cation binding in the hairpin ribozyme with tb iii  edited by j doudna
catalysis by the hairpin ribozyme is stimulated by a wide range of both simple and complex metallic and organic cations this independence from divalent metal ion binding unequivocally excludes inner sphere coordination to rna as an obligatory role for metal ions in catalysis hence the hairpin ribozyme is a unique model to study the role of outer sphere coordinated cations in folding of a catalytically functional rna structure here we demonstrate that micromolar concentrations of a deprotonated aqueous complex of the lanthanide metal ion terbium iii  tb oh aq   reversibly inhibit the ribozyme by competing for a crucial yet non selective cation binding site tb oh aq  also reports a likely location of this binding site through backbone hydrolysis and permits the analysis of metal binding through sensitized luminescence we propose that the critical cation binding site is located at a position within the catalytic core that displays an appropriately sized pocket and a high negative charge density we show that cationic occupancy of this site is required for tertiary folding and catalysis yet the site can be productively occupied by a wide variety of cations it is striking that micromolar tb oh aq  concentrations are compatible with tertiary folding yet interfere with catalysis the motif implicated here in cation binding has also been found to organize the structure of multi helix loops in evolutionary ancient ribosomal rnas our findings therefore illuminate general principles of non selective outer sphere cation binding in rna structure and function that may have prevailed in primitive ribozymes of an early  rna world
