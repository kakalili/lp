pathogenic and non pathogenic polyglutamine tracts have similar structural properties towards a length dependent toxicity gradient
abnormally expanded polyglutamine polyq tracts provide a gain of toxic functions to nine otherwise unrelated human proteins and induce progressive neurodegenerative diseases over the past ten years it was suggested that only polyq tracts longer than a specific threshold adopt a particular structure which would be the cause of the apparent polyq length dependent toxicity threshold observed in polyq diseases we have used a combination of biochemical and biophysical approaches to compare the structural properties of polyq of pathogenic and non pathogenic lengths under various conditions we observe that pathogenic and non pathogenic polyq as soluble species and upon interaction with a partner during aggregation or as mature aggregates display very similar structural properties polyq length only influences the aggregation kinetics and to a lesser extent the stability of the aggregates we thus propose that polyq toxicity does not depend on a structural transition occurring above a specific threshold but rather that polyq tracts are inherently toxic sequences whose deleterious effect gradually increases with their length we discuss how polyq properties and other cellular factors may explain the existence of an apparent polyq length dependent toxicity threshold
