papillomavirus capsid protein expression in escherichia coli purification and assembly of hpv  and hpv  l  edited by m yaniv
the l major capsid proteins of human papillomavirus hpv types  and  were purified and analyzed for structural integrity and in vitro self assembly proteins were expressed in escherichia coli as glutathione s transferase l  gst l  fusions and purified to near homogeneity as pentamers equivalent to viral capsomeres  after thrombin cleavage from the gst moiety and removal of tightly associated groel protein sequences at the amino and carboxy termini contributing to formation of l pentamers and to in vitro capsid assembly were identified by deletion analysis for both hpv  and hpv  l  up to at least ten residues could be deleted from the amino terminus  n  and  residues from the carboxy terminus  c  without affecting pentamer formation the hpv  pentamers assembled into relatively regular   pentamer shells   virus like particles  or vlps at low ph with the exception of hpv  l  n  which assembled into a  pentamer t   capsid small vlp under all conditions tested the production of large quantities of assembly competent l  using the expression and purification protocol described here has been useful for crystallographic analysis and will be valuable for studies of virus receptor interactions and potentially for vaccine design
