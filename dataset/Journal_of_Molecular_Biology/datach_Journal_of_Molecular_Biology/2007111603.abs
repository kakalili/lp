electrostatic contributions to the stability of the gcn leucine zipper structure
ion pairs are ubiquitous in x ray structures of coiled coils and mutagenesis of charged residues can result in large stability losses by contrast pka values determined by nmr in solution often predict only small contributions to stability from charge interactions to help reconcile these results we used triple resonance nmr to determine pka values for all groups that ionize between ph  and  in the  residue leucine zipper fragment gcn p in addition to the native state we also determined comprehensive pka values for two models of the gcn p denatured state the protein in  m urea and unfolded peptide fragments of the protein in water only residues that form ion pairs in multiple x ray structures of gcn p gave large pka differences between the native and denatured states moreover electrostatic contributions to stability were not equivalent for oppositely charged partners in ion pairs suggesting that the interactions between a charge and its environment are as important as those within the ion pair the ph dependence of protein stability calculated from nmr derived pka values agreed with the stability profile measured from equilibrium urea unfolding experiments as a function of ph the stability profile was also reproduced with structure based continuum electrostatic calculations although contributions to stability were overestimated at the extremes of ph we consider potential sources of errors in the calculations and how pka predictions could be improved our results show that although hydrophobic packing and hydrogen bonding have dominant roles electrostatic interactions also make significant contributions to the stability of the coiled coil
