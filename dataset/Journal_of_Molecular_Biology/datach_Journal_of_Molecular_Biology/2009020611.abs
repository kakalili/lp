structure of human mdm n terminal domain bound to a single domain antibody
the n terminal domain of mdm binds to the n terminal transactivation domain of the tumor suppressor p  and is an important negative regulator of its transactivation activity as such inhibition of the binding of mdm to p  is a target for anticancer therapy the protein has not been crystallized satisfactorily for structural studies without the addition of an n terminal p  peptide we selected a single domain antibody vh  that bound to the human domain with a dissociation constant of   nm we solved the structure of the complex at    resolution the asymmetric unit contained eight molecules of vh and four molecules of mdm  a molecule of vh was located in each transactivation domain binding site and the four non mdm bound vh domains provided additional crystal contacts there are differences between the structures of human mdm domain bound to vh and those of human and zebra fish mdm bound to a p  peptide molecular dynamics simulations showed that the binding pocket in the three mdm structures converged to a common conformation after removal of the ligands indicating that the differences are due to induced fit the largest conformational changes were for the mdm molecules bound to p  the simulated and observed structures should aid rational drug design the use of single domain antibodies to aid crystallization by creating a molecular scaffold may have a wider range of applications
