consistency analysis of similarity between multiple alignments prediction of protein function and fold structure from analysis of local sequence motifs edited by b holland
a new method to analyze the similarity between multiply aligned protein motifs blocks was developed it identifies sets of consistently aligned blocks these are found to be protein regions of similar function and structure that appear in different contexts for example the rossmann fold ligand binding region is found similar to tim barrel and methylase regions various protein families are predicted to have a tim barrel fold and the structural relation between the clpp protease and crotonase folds is identified from their sequence besides identifying local structure features sequence similarity across short sequence regions less than  amino acid regions also predicts structure similarity of whole domains folds a few hundred amino acid reidues long most of these relations could not be identified by other advanced sequence to sequence or sequence to multiple alignments comparisons we describe the method termed cyrca  present examples of our findings and discuss their implications
