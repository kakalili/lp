trapping of a transcription complex using a new nucleotide analogue amp aluminium fluoride
mechanochemical proteins rely on atp hydrolysis to establish the different functional states required for their biological output studying the transient functional intermediate states these proteins adopt as they progress through the atp hydrolysis cycle is key to understanding the molecular basis of their mechanism many of these intermediates have been successfully  trapped  and functionally characterised using atp analogues here we present a new nucleotide analogue amp  alfx which traps pspf a bacterial enhancer binding protein in a stable complex with the   rna polymerase holoenzyme the crystal structure of amp  alfx  pspf    provides new information on protein  nucleotide interactions and suggests that the  and  phosphates are more important than the  phosphate in terms of sensing nucleotide bound states in addition functional data obtained with amp  alfx establish distinct roles for the conserved catalytic aaa  atpases associated with various cellular activities residues suggesting that amp  alfx is a powerful new tool to study aaa protein family members and more generally walker motif atpases
