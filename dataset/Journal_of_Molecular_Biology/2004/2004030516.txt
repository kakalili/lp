In order to identify the amino acids that determine protein structure and function it is useful to rank them by their relative importance. Previous approaches belong to two groups; those that rely on statistical inference, and those that focus on phylogenetic analysis. Here, we introduce a class of hybrid methods that combine evolutionary and entropic information from multiple sequence alignments. A detailed analysis in insulin receptor kinase domain and tests on proteins that are well-characterized experimentally show the hybrids' greater robustness with respect to the input choice of sequences, as well as improved sensitivity and specificity of prediction. This is a further step toward proteome scale analysis of protein structure and function.
