Monoclonal antibodies have a potential for cancer therapy that may be further improved by linking them to effector molecules such as superantigens. Tumor targeting of a superantigen leads to a powerful T cell attack against the tumour tissue. Encouraging results have been observed preclinically and in patients using the superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin A, SEA. To further improve the concept, we have reduced the reactivity to antibodies against superantigens, which is found in all individuals. Using epitope mapping, antibody binding sites in SEA and SEE were found around their MHC class II binding sites. These epitopes were removed genetically and a large number of synthetic superantigens were produced in an iterative engineering procedure. Properties such as decreased binding to anti-SEA as well as higher selectivity to induce killing of tumour cells compared to MHC class II expressing cells, were sequentially improved. The lysine residues 79, 81, 83 and 84 are all part of major antigenic epitopes, Gln204, Lys74, Asp75 and Asn78 are important for optimal killing of tumour cells while Asp45 affects binding to MHC class II. The production properties were optimised by further engineering and a novel synthetic superantigen, SEA/E-120, was designed. It is recognised by approximately 15% of human anti-SEA antibodies and have more potent tumour cell killing properties than SEA. SEA/E-120 is likely to have a low toxicity due to its reduced capacity to mediate killing of MHC class II expressing cells. It is produced as a Fab fusion protein at approximately 35 mg/l in Escherichiacoli.
