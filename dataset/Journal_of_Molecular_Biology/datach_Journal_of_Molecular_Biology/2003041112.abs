how reliable are experimental protein  protein interaction data
data of protein  protein interactions provide valuable insight into the molecular networks underlying a living cell however their accuracy is often questioned calling for a rigorous assessment of their reliability the computation offered here provides an intelligible mean to assess directly the rate of true positives in a data set of experimentally determined interacting protein pairs we show that the reliability of high throughput yeast two hybrid assays is about   and that the size of the yeast interactome is estimated to be         interactions
