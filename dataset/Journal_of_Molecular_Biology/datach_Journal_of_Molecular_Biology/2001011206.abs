crystal structure of an enzyme substrate complex provides insight into the interaction between human arylsulfatase a and its substrates during catalysis
arylsulfatase a asa belongs to the sulfatase family whose members carry a c  formylglycine that is post translationally generated by oxidation of a conserved cysteine or serine residue the crystal structures of two arylsulfatases asa and asb and kinetic studies on asa mutants led to different proposals for the catalytic mechanism in the hydrolysis of sulfate esters the structures of two asa mutants that lack the functional c  formylglycine residue   in complex with a synthetic substrate have been determined in order to unravel the reaction mechanism the crystal structure of the inactive mutant c a asa in complex with p nitrocatechol sulfate pncs mimics a reaction intermediate during sulfate ester hydrolysis by the active enzyme without the covalent bond to the key side chain fgly  the structure shows that the side chains of lysine   lysine   serine   histidine   the main chain of the key residue  and the divalent cation in the active center are involved in sulfate binding it is proposed that histidine   protonates the leaving alcoholate after hydrolysis c s asa is able to bind covalently to the substrate and hydrolyze it but is unable to release the resulting sulfate nevertheless the resulting sulfation is low the structure of c s asa shows the serine side chain in a single conformation turned away from the position a substrate occupies in the complex this suggests that the double conformation observed in the structure of wild type asa is more likely to correspond to a formylglycine hydrate than to a twofold disordered aldehyde oxo group and accounts for the relative inertness of the c s asa mutant in the c s asa pncs complex the substrate occupies the same position as in the c a asa pncs complex which corresponds to the non covalently bonded substrate based on the structural data a detailed mechanism for sulfate ester cleavage is proposed involving an aldehyde hydrate as the functional group
