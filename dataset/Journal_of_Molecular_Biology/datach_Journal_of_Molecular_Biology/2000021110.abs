fast folding of a ribozyme by stabilizing core interactions evidence for multiple folding pathways in rna edited by i tinoco
folding of the tetrahymena ribozyme under physiological conditions in vitro is limited by slow conversion of long lived intermediates to the active structure these intermediates arise because the most stable domain of the ribozyme folds     times more rapidly than the core region containing helix p  native gel electrophoresis and time resolved x ray dependent hydroxyl radical cleavage revealed that mutations that weaken peripheral interactions between domains accelerated folding fivefold while a point mutation that stabilizes p enabled   of the mutant rna to reach the native conformation within  seconds at   c the p mutation increased the folding rate of the catalytic core as much as  fold so that both domains of the ribozyme were formed at approximately the same rate the results show that the ribozyme folds rapidly without significantly populating metastable intermediates when native interactions in the ribozyme core are stabilized relative to peripheral structural elements
