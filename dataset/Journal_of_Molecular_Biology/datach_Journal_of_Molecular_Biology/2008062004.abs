structural basis for the regulation of muscle contraction by troponin and tropomyosin
the molecular switching mechanism governing skeletal and cardiac muscle contraction couples the binding of ca  on troponin to the movement of tropomyosin on actin filaments despite years of investigation this mechanism remains unclear because it has not yet been possible to directly assess the structural influence of troponin on tropomyosin that causes actin filaments and hence myosin  crossbridge cycling and contraction to switch on and off a c terminal domain of troponin i is thought to be intimately involved in inducing tropomyosin movement to an inhibitory position that blocks myosin  crossbridge interaction release of this regulatory latching domain from actin after ca  binding to tnc the ca  sensor of troponin that relieves inhibition presumably allows tropomyosin movement away from the inhibitory position on actin thus initiating contraction however the structural interactions of the regulatory domain of tni the  inhibitory  subunit of troponin with tropomyosin and actin that cause tropomyosin movement are unknown and thus the regulatory process is not well defined here thin filaments were labeled with an engineered construct representing c terminal tni and then  d electron microscopy was used to resolve where troponin is anchored on actin  tropomyosin electron microscopy reconstruction showed how tni binding to both actin and tropomyosin at low ca  competes with tropomyosin for a common site on actin and drives tropomyosin movement to a constrained relaxing position to inhibit myosin  crossbridge association thus the observations reported reveal the structural mechanism responsible for troponin  tropomyosin mediated steric interference of actin  myosin interaction that regulates muscle contraction
