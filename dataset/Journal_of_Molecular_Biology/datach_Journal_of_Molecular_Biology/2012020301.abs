p  requires an intact c terminal domain for dna binding and transactivation
the tumor suppressor p  plays a critical role in mediating cellular response to a wide range of environmental stresses p  regulates these processes mainly by acting as a short lived dna binding protein that stimulates transcription from numerous genes involved in cell cycle arrest programmed cell death and other processes to investigate the importance of the c terminal domain of p  we generated a series of deletion and point mutations in this region and analyzed their effects on p  transcription activity our results show that c terminal deletion and point mutations at k  and k  abolish p  mediated transcription in the context of dna or chromatin this defect is specific for dna molecules because inactive mutants fail to bind a consensus p  response element in both free dna and nucleosomes chromatin immunoprecipitation assays further substantiate the importance of the p  c terminal domain for the targeted localization of p  and the concomitant recruitment of p  onto p  responsive genes moreover a synthetic peptide comprising the last  amino acids of p  interacts with the n terminal and c terminal domains of p  and antagonizes p  dependent transcription taken together our data reveal a functional requirement for the p  c terminal domain in p  transactivation and support a working model in which the c terminus serves as a positive regulator for n terminal activation and central dna binding domains
