the adoption of a twisted structure of importin  is essential for the protein protein interaction required for nuclear transport edited by k nagai
importin  is a nuclear transport factor which mediates the nuclear import of various nuclear proteins the n terminal     residue fragment of mouse importin   imp    possesses the ability to bidirectionally translocate through the nuclear pore complex npc  and to bind rangtp the structure of the uncomplexed form of imp   has been solved at a    resolution by x ray crystallography it consists of ten copies of the tandemly arrayed heat repeat and exhibits conformational flexibility which is involved in protein protein interaction for nuclear transport the overall conformation of the heat repeats shows that a twisted motion produces a significantly varied superhelical architecture from the previously reported structure of rangtp bound importin   these conformational changes appear to be the sum of small conformational changes throughout the polypeptide such a flexibility which resides in the stacked heat repeats is essential for interaction with rangtp or with npcs furthermore it was found that imp   has a structural similarity with another nuclear migrating protein namely  catenin which is composed of another type of helix repeated structure of arm repeat interestingly the essential regions for npc translocation for both importin  and  catenin are spatially well overlapped with one another this strongly indicates the importance of helix stacking of the heat or arm repeats for npc passage
