differential remodeling of the hiv  nucleosome upon transcription activators and swi snf complex binding edited by m yaniv
here we have examined hiv  nucleosome remodeling upon the binding of transcription factors and the swi snf complex using a novel approach the approach combines uv laser protein dna crosslinking electrophoretic mobility shift analysis and dnase i protection analysis with immunochemical techniques it was found that single activator bound hiv  nucleosomes exhibit very weak perturbation in histone nh tail dna interactions however the simultaneous binding of the transcription activators sp  nf kb  lef  and usf synergistically increased the release of histone nh tails from nucleosomal dna in contrast the binding of swi snf complex to hiv  nucleosome disrupted structured histone domain dna contacts but not histone nh tail dna interactions stable remodeled nucleosomes  obtained after detachment of swi snf  displayed identical structural alterations with those bound to swi snf these results demonstrate a different in vitro remodeling of the hiv  nucleosome upon the binding of multiple transcription activators and of swi snf complex
