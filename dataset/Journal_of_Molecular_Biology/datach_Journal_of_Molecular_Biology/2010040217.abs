crystal structures of the solute receptor gach of streptomyces glaucescens in complex with acarbose and an acarbose homolog comparison with the acarbose loaded maltose binding protein of salmonella typhimurium
gach is the solute binding protein receptor of the putative oligosaccharide atp binding cassette transporter gacfg encoded in the acarbose biosynthetic gene cluster gac from streptomyces glaucescens gla o in the context of the proposed function of acarbose acarviosyl   maltose as a  carbophor   the transporter in complex with a yet to be identified atpase subunit is supposed to mediate the uptake of longer acarbose homologs and acarbose for recycling purposes binding assays using isothermal titration calorimetry identified gach as a maltose maltodextrin binding protein with a low affinity for acarbose but with considerable binding activity for its homolog component c acarviosyl   maltose   glucose   glucose  in contrast the maltose binding protein of salmonella typhimurium male displays high affinity acarbose binding we determined the crystal structures of gach in complex with acarbose component c and maltotetraose as well as in unliganded form as found for other solute receptors the polypeptide chain of gach is folded into two distinct domains lobes connected by a hinge with the interface between the lobes forming the substrate binding pocket gach does not specifically bind the acarviosyl group but displays specificity for binding of the maltose moiety in the inner part of its binding pocket the crystal structure of acarbose loaded male showed that two glucose units of acarbose are bound at the same region and position as maltose a comparative analysis revealed that in gach acarbose is buried deeper into the binding pocket than in male by exactly one glucose ring shift resulting in a total of  hydrogen bond interactions versus  hydrogen bond interactions for maleacarbose since the substrate specificity of atp binding cassette import systems is determined by the cognate binding protein our results provide the first biochemical and structural evidence for the proposed role of gachfg in acarbose metabolism
