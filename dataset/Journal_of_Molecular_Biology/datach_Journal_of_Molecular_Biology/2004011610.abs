crystal structure of fervidolysin from fervidobacterium pennivorans a keratinolytic enzyme related to subtilisin
structure forming fibrous proteins like keratins gelatins and collagens are degraded only by a few proteases as their tight packing limits access to the potential cleavage sites to understand the keratin degradation in detail we describe the first crystal structure of a keratin degrading enzyme keratinase  fervidolysin from fervidobacterium pennivorans as an immature form with propeptide pd bound the    resolution crystal structure shows that the protease is composed of four domains a catalytic domain cd  two  sandwich domains sds  and the pd domain a structural alignment shows a distant relationship between the pd  cd substructure of fervidolysin and pro subtilisin e tight binding of pd to the remaining part of the protease is mediated by hydrogen bonds along the domain surfaces and around the active cleft and by the clamps to sd and sd  the crystal structure of this multi domain protein fervidolysin provides insights into proenzyme activation and the role of non catalytic domains suggesting a functional relationship to the fibronectin fn like domains of the human promatrix metalloprotease  prommp  that degrades the fibrous polymeric substrate gelatin
