amyloid  sheet secondary structure identified in uv induced cataracts of porcine lenses using d ir spectroscopy
cataracts are formed by the aggregation of crystallin proteins in the eye lens many in vitro studies have established that crystallin proteins precipitate into aggregates that contain amyloid fibers when denatured but there is little evidence that ex vivo cataracts contain amyloid in this study we collect two dimensional infrared  d ir spectra on tissue slices of porcine eye lenses as shown in control experiments on in vitro  b and  d crystallin  d ir spectroscopy can identify the highly ordered  sheets typical of amyloid secondary structure even if the fibers themselves are too short to be resolved with tem in ex vivo experiments of acid treated tissues characteristic d ir features are observed and fibers gt  nm in length are resolved by transmission electron microscopy tem  consistent with amyloid fibers in uv irradiated lens tissues fibers are not observed with tem but highly ordered  sheets of amyloid secondary structure is identified from the d ir spectra the characteristic d ir features of amyloid  sheet secondary structure are created by as few as four or five strands and so identify amyloid secondary structure even if the aggregates themselves are too small to be resolved with tem we discuss these findings in the context of the chaperone system of the lens which we hypothesize sequesters small aggregates thereby preventing long fibers from forming this study expands the scope of heterodyned d ir spectroscopy to tissues the results provide a link between in vitro and ex vivo studies and support the hypothesis that cataracts are an amyloid disease
