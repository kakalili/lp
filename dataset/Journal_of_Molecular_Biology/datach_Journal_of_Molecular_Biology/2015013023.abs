movement of elongation factor g between compact and extended conformations
previous structural studies suggested that ribosomal translocation is accompanied by large interdomain rearrangements of elongation factor g ef g  here we follow the movement of domain iv of ef g relative to domain ii of ef g using ensemble and single molecule f rster resonance energy transfer our results indicate that ribosome free ef g predominantly adopts a compact conformation that can also albeit infrequently transition into a more extended conformation in which domain iv moves away from domain ii by contrast ribosome bound ef g predominantly adopts an extended conformation regardless of whether it is interacting with pretranslocation ribosomes or with posttranslocation ribosomes our data suggest that ribosome bound ef g may also occasionally sample at least one more compact conformation gtp hydrolysis catalyzed by ef g does not affect the relative stability of the observed conformations in ribosome free and ribosome bound ef g our data support a model suggesting that upon binding to a pretranslocation ribosome ef g moves from a compact to a more extended conformation this transition is not coupled to but likely precedes both gtp hydrolysis and mrna trna translocation
