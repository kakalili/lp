multiple time scale backbone dynamics of homologous thermophilic and mesophilic ribonuclease hi enzymes
backbone conformational fluctuations on multiple time scales in a cysteine free thermus thermophilus ribonuclease hi mutant ttrnh   are quantified using  n nuclear magnetic spin relaxation laboratory frame relaxation data acquired at   k and at static magnetic field strengths of      and   t are analysed using reduced spectral density mapping and model free approaches chemical exchange line broadening is characterized using hahn echo transverse and multiple quantum relaxation data acquired over a temperature range of      k and at a static magnetic field strength of   t results for ttrnh  are compared to previously published data for a mesophilic homologue escherichia coli ribonuclease hi ecrnh  intramolecular conformational fluctuations on the picosecond to nanosecond time scale generally are similar for ttrnh  and ecrnh   strands  and  and the glycine rich region are more rigid while the substrate binding handle region and c terminal tail are more flexible in ttrnh  than in ecrnh rigidity in the two  strands and the glycine rich region located along the periphery of the central  sheet may be associated with the increased thermodynamic stability of the thermophilic enzyme chemical exchange line broadening reflecting microsecond to millisecond time scale conformational changes is more pronounced in ttrnh  than in ecrnh particularly for residues in the handle and surrounding the catalytic site the temperature dependence of chemical exchange show an increase of    kj mol in the apparent activation energies for ttrnh  residues in the handle compared to ecrnh increased activation barriers coupled with motion between  helices b and c not present in ecrnh may be associated with the reduced catalytic activity of the thermophilic enzyme at   k
