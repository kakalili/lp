statistical theory of combinatorial libraries of folding proteins energetic discrimination of a target structure edited by j thornton
a self consistent theory is presented that can be used to estimate the number and composition of sequences satisfying a predetermined set of constraints the theory is formulated so as to examine the features of sequences having a particular value of   ef    e  u where ef is the energy of sequences when in a target structure and  e  u is an average energy of non target structures the theory yields the probabilities wi   that each position i in the sequence is occupied by a particular monomer type   the theory is applied to a simple lattice model of proteins excellent agreement is observed between the theory and the results of exact enumerations the theory provides a quantitative framework for the design and interpretation of combinatorial experiments involving proteins where a library of amino acid sequences is searched for sequences that fold to a desired structure
