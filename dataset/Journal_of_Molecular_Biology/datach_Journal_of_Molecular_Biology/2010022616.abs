synergistic cooperation between two clpb isoforms in aggregate reactivation
bacterial aaa atpase clpb cooperates with dnak during reactivation of aggregated proteins the clpb mediated disaggregation is linked to translocation of polypeptides through the channel in the oligomeric clpb two isoforms of clpb are produced in vivo the full length clpb  and clpb  which does not contain the substrate interacting n terminal domain the biological role of the truncated isoform clpb  is unknown we found that resolubilization of aggregated proteins in escherichia coli after heat shock and reactivation of aggregated proteins in vitro and in vivo occurred at higher rates in the presence of clpb  with clpb  than with clpb  or clpb  alone combined amounts of clpb  and clpb  bound to aggregated substrates were similar to the amounts of either clpb  or clpb  bound to the substrates in the absence of another isoform the atp hydrolysis rate of clpb  with clpb  which is linked to the rate of substrate translocation was not higher than the rates measured for the isolated clpb  or clpb  we postulate that a reaction step that takes place after substrate binding to clpb and precedes substrate translocation is rate limiting during aggregate reactivation and its efficiency is enhanced in the presence of both clpb isoforms moreover we found that clpb  and clpb  form hetero oligomers which are similar in size to the homo oligomers of clpb  or clpb  thus the mechanism of functional cooperation of the two isoforms of clpb may be linked to their heteroassociation our results suggest that the functionality of other aaa atpases may be also optimized by interaction and synergistic cooperation of their isoforms
