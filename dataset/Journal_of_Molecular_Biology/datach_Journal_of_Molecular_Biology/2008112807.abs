ferroplasma acidarmanus rpa facilitates efficient unwinding of forked dna substrates by monomers of facxpd helicase
the strand separation activity that is important for many cellular dna processing machineries is provided by dna helicases in order to understand the physiological properties of a helicase acting in the context of its macromolecular machinery it is imperative to identify the proteins that interact with the enzyme and to analyze how these proteins affect its helicase activities the archaeal rad helicase xpd xeroderma pigmentosum group d protein from ferroplasma acidarmanus facxpd is a superfamily ii       dna helicase similar to its mammalian homolog working as an integral part of the transcription factor iih complex facxpd may play an important role in nucleotide excision repair ner and transcription initiation interaction between facxpd and other archaeal ner proteins likely modulates their respective activities replication protein a rpa  a single stranded dna ssdna binding protein is one of the ner proteins that functionally interact with the human transcription factor iih complex there are two rpa proteins in f acidarmanus facrpa  a homodimer of two monomers consisting of two oligonucleotide oligosaccharide binding folds and facrpa  a monomer containing a single oligonucleotide oligosaccharide binding fold in this study we analyzed the effect of these ssdna binding proteins on facxpd helicase activity we found that facrpa stimulates dna unwinding by facxpd helicase through a novel mechanism by providing a helix destabilizing function in contrast facrpa fails to stimulate helicase activity to the same extent as facrpa and competes with facxpd for binding to the ssdna  double stranded dna junction we conclude that the facrpa coated fork is a preferred and likely physiological substrate that a monomer of facxpd can unwind with a processivity sufficient for expansion of the ner or transcription bubble we also suggest that duplex melting by a cognate ssdna binding protein coordinated with translocation by a helicase may represent a common strategy for duplex unwinding by the rad family of helicases
