p   map kinase c terminal domain binding pocket characterized by crystallographic and computational analyses
the mitogen activated protein map kinase protein family has a critical role in cellular signaling events with map kinase p   acting in inflammatory processes and being an important drug discovery target map kinase drug design efforts have focused on small molecule inhibitors of the atp catalytic site which exhibit dose limiting adverse effects therefore characterizing other potential sites that bind substrates inhibitors or allosteric effectors is of great interest here we present the crystal structure of human p   map kinase which has a lead compound bound both in the active site and in the lipid binding site of the c terminal cap this c terminal cap is formed from an extension to the kinase fold unique to the map kinase and cyclin dependent kinase families and glycogen synthase kinase  binding of this lead     fluorophenyl  h pyrazol  yl pyridine to wild type p   induces movement of the c terminal cap region creating a hydrophobic pocket centered around residue trp   computational analysis of this c terminal domain pocket indicates notable flexibility for potentially binding different shaped compounds including lipids oxidized arachidonic acid species such as leukotrienes and small molecule effectors furthermore our structural results defining the open p   c lobe pocket provide a detailed framework for the design of novel small molecules with affinities comparable to active site binders to bind and potentially modulate the shape and activity of p   in predetermined ways moreover these results and analyses of p   suggest strategies for designing specific binding compounds applicable to other map kinases as well as the cyclin dependent kinase family and glycogen synthase kinase   that also utilize the c terminal insert in their interactions
