sheared type ganti csyn base pair a unique d gxc loop closure motif
stable dna loop structures closed by a novel g c base pair have been determined for the single residue d gxc loops x a t g or c in low salt solution by high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance nmr techniques the closing g c base pair in these loops is not of the canonical watson  crick type but adopts instead a unique sheared type trans watson  crick sugar edge pairing like those occurring in the sheared mismatched g a or a c base pair to draw the two opposite strands together the cytidine residue in the closing base pair is transformed into the rare syn domain to form two h bonds with the guanine base and to prevent the steric clash between the g nh and the c h  protons besides the sugar pucker of the syn cytidine is still located in the regular c   endo domain unlike the c   endo domain adopted for the pyrimidines of the out of alternation left handed z dna structure the facile formation of the compact d gxc loops closed by a unique sheared type ganti csyn base pair demonstrates the great potential of the single stranded d gxc triplet repeats to fold into stable hairpins
