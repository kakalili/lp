experimental tests of villin subdomain folding simulations
we have used laser temperature jump to investigate the kinetics and mechanism of folding the  residue subdomain of the villin headpiece the relaxation kinetics are biphasic with a sub microsecond phase corresponding to a helix  coil transition and a slower microsecond phase corresponding to overall unfolding refolding at   k the folding time is       s making it the fastest folding naturally occurring protein with a rate close to the theoretical speed limit this time is in remarkable agreement with the prediction of        s by zagrovic et al from atomistic molecular dynamics simulations using an implicit solvent model we test their prediction that replacement of the c terminal phenylalanine residue with alanine will increase the folding rate by removing a transient non native interaction we find that the alanine substitution has no effect on the folding rate or on the equilibrium constant implications of this result for the validity of the simulated folding mechanism are discussed
