structure and interactions of the cs domain of human h aca rnp assembly protein shq
shq is an essential protein involved in the early steps of biogenesis and assembly of h aca ribonucleoprotein particles rnps  shq binds to dyskerin cbf in yeast at an early step of h aca rnp assembly and is subsequently displaced by the h aca rna shq contains an n terminal cs and a c terminal shq specific domain ssd  dyskerin harbors many mutations associated with dyskeratosis congenita structures of yeast shq ssd bound to cbf revealed that only a subset of these mutations is in the ssd binding site implicating another subset in the putative cs binding site here we present the crystal structure of human shq cs hcs and the nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and crystal structures of hcs containing a serine substitution for proline  that is associated with some prostate cancers the structure of hcs is similar to yeast shq cs domain ycs and consists of two  sheets that form an immunoglobulin like  sandwich fold the n terminal affinity tag sequence ahhhhhh associates with a neighboring protein in the crystal lattice to form an extra  strand deletion of this tag was required to get spectra suitable for nmr structure determination while the tag was required for crystallization nmr chemical shift perturbation csp experiments with peptides derived from putative cs binding sites on dyskerin and cbf revealed a conserved surface on cs important for cbf dyskerin binding a haddock high ambiguity driven protein  protein docking model of a shq cbf complex that defines the position of cs domain in the pre h aca rnp was calculated using the csp data
