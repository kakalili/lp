r loop depletion by over expressed rnase h in mouse b cells increases activation induced deaminase access to the transcribed strand without altering frequency of isotype switching
r loops three strand structures consisting of mrna hybridized to the complementary dna and a single stranded dna loop are formed in switch regions on the heavy chain immunoglobulin locus to determine if r loops have a direct effect on any of the steps involved in isotype switching we generated a transgenic mouse that over expressed rnase h  an enzyme that cleaves the rna of rna dna hybrids in b cells r loops in the switch  region were depleted by   in ex vivo activated splenic b cells frequencies of isotype switching to igg  igg b igg c and igg were the same as c bl  control cells however somatic hypermutation was increased specifically on the transcribed strand from     joins indicating that r loops limit activation induced cytosine deaminase access to the transcribed dna strand our data suggest that in the normal g c rich context of mammalian class switch recombination regions r loops are obligatory intermediates processing of the r loops is needed to remove rna allowing activation induced cytosine deaminase to promote somatic hypermutation on both dna strands to generate double strand dna breaks for efficient class switch recombination one of the two cellular rnases h may assist in this process
