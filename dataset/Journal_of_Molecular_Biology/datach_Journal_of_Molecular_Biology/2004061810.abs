short range long range and transition state interactions in the denatured state of acbp from residual dipolar couplings
residual dipolar couplings in the denatured state of bovine acyl coenzyme a binding protein acbp oriented in strained polyacrylamide gels have been shown to be a sensitive sequence specific probe for residual secondary structure results supporting this were obtained by comparing residual dipolar couplings under different denaturing conditions the data were analyzed using the program molecular fragment replacement mfr  which demonstrated  helix propensity in four isolated stretches along the protein backbone and these coincide with the location of native helices this is in full agreement with earlier findings based on secondary chemical shift values furthermore n  h residual dipolar couplings provided direct evidence for the existence of native like hydrophobic interactions in the acid denatured state of acbp at ph   it was shown that replacement of the hydrophobic side chain of residue ile  with alanine in helix a leads to large decreases of residual dipolar couplings in residues that form helix a in the native state it is suggested that the ile to ala mutation changes the probability for the formation of long range interactions which are present in the acid denatured state of the wild type protein these long range interactions are similar to those proposed to form in the transition state of folding of acbp therefore the application of residual dipolar couplings in combination with a comparative mutation study has demonstrated the presence of precursors to the folding transition state under acid unfolding conditions
