human genome search in celiac disease mutated gliadin t cell like epitope in two human proteins promotes t cell activation
discovery of a number of novel and known human genes whose protein products bear striking similarity to two or more wheat gliadin domains raised the possibility that human intestinal non hla peptides homologous to celiac t cell epitopes could play a role in non hla gene specification in celiac disease database searching of the entire human genome identified only  gut expressed proteins with high t cell epitope homology particularly to the dq   i gliadin epitope i e tfiia foxj and igd mean bestfit quality score  versus random value of   others were similar to dq   i gliadin i e pax  bestfit quality  versus  for random  or dq   ii gliadin phlda  known in mice as the t cell death associated gene bestfit quality  versus  for random epitopes among proteins previously screened for gliadin homology noteworthy was achaete scute homologous protein dq   i gliadin bestfit quality  versus  for random  with the exception of igd all are nuclear factors paying particular attention to the position of potential major histocompatibility complex mhc anchor residues several were selected for testing in a dq   i gliadin restricted t cell system all native  mer peptides were inactive even when deamidated but v f substitution of deamidated tfiia amino acid residues     stimulated il  release at levels exceeding the wheat gliadin positive control also active but only slightly was l  f substitution of aib amino acid residues       plotsimilarity alignment of tfiias from eight species revealed subthreshold similarity score in the peptide region in contrast to the highly conserved amino and carboxy termini molecular modeling of tfiia v f peptide points to an important juxtaposition of an upwardly projecting phenylalanine residue at peptide position  that likely contacts a receptor complementarity determining region and a downwardly projecting glutamic acid residue that fits into the shallow mhc p pocket these observations tentatively point to a new multi gene hypothesis for the initiation of celiac disease in which deamidated free human peptides with t cell epitope homology particularly those made more homologous by mutation escape negative selection as per deamidation of the hel    peptide in the hen egg lysozyme model of autoimmunity deamidation following peptide release due to injury triggers inflammation thereafter repeatedly provoked by dietary gliadin immunodominant peptides concentrated in the proximal small intestine
