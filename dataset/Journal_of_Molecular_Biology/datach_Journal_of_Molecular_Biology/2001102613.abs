folding and self assembly of herpes simplex virus type  thymidine kinase edited by c r matthews
thymidine kinase from herpes simplex virus type  hsv tk has been postulated to be a homodimer throughout the x ray crystallography literature our study shows that hsv tk exists as a monomer dimer equilibrium mixture in dilute aqueous solutions in the presence of   mm nacl the equilibrium is characterized by a dissociation constant of    m this constant was determined by analytical ultracentrifugation and gel filtration experiments dimerization seems to be unfavorable for enzymatic activity dimers show inferior catalytic efficiency compared to the monomers moreover soluble oligomers formed by self assembly of tk in the absence of physiological salt concentrations are even enzymatically inactive this study investigates enzymatic and structural relevance of the tk dimer in vitro dissociation of the dimers into monomers is not accompanied by large overall changes in secondary or tertiary structure as shown by thermal and urea induced unfolding studies monitored by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy a disulfide bridge mutant tk v  c was designed bearing two cysteine residues at the dimer interface in order to crosslink the two subunits covalently under reducing conditions the properties of v  c and wild type hsv tk wt hsv tk were identical in terms of expression yield denaturing sds page gel electrophoresis enzyme kinetics cd spectra and thermal stability crosslinked v  c v  cox was found to have an increased thermal stability with a tm value of       c which is  deg c higher than for the wild type protein this is thought to be a consequence of the conformational restriction of the dimer interface furthermore enzyme kinetic studies on v  cox revealed a km for thymidine of    m corresponding to wt hsv tk but a significantly higher km for atp the present findings raise the question whether the monomer not the dimer might be the active species in vivo
