fusion activity of hiv gp  fusion domain is related to its secondary structure and depth of membrane insertion in a cholesterol dependent fashion
the human immunodeficiency virus hiv gp  fusion domain plays a critical role in membrane fusion during viral entry a thorough understanding of the relationship between the structure and the activity of the fusion domain in different lipid environments helps to formulate mechanistic models on how it might function in mediating membrane fusion the secondary structure of the fusion domain in small liposomes composed of different lipid mixtures was investigated by circular dichroism spectroscopy  the fusion domain formed an  helix in membranes containing less than   mol cholesterol and  formed  sheet secondary structure in membranes containing    mol cholesterol epr spectra of spin labeled fusion domains also indicated different conformations in membranes with and without cholesterol power saturation epr data were further used to determine the orientation and depth of  helical fusion domains in lipid bilayers fusion and membrane perturbation activities of the gp  fusion domain were measured by lipid mixing and contents leakage the fusion domain fused membranes in both its helical form and its  sheet form high cholesterol which induced  sheets promoted fusion however acidic lipids which promoted relatively deep membrane insertion as an  helix also induced fusion the results indicate that the structure of the hiv gp  fusion domain is plastic and depends critically on the lipid environment provided that their membrane insertion is deep   helical and  sheet conformations contribute to membrane fusion
