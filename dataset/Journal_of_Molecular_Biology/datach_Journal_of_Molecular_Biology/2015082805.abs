scaffold protein slp  primes plc  for activation by itk mediated phosphorylation
activation of the phospholipase plc   is critical for proper t cell signaling following antigen receptor engagement in t cells the tec family kinase interleukin  induced tyrosine kinase itk  phosphorylates plc  at tyrosine   y   leading to activation of phospholipase function and subsequent production of the second messengers inositol    trisphosphate and diacylglycerol in this work we demonstrate that plc  can be primed for itk mediated phosphorylation on y  by a specific region of the adaptor protein slp   the slp  phosphotyrosine containing sequence py  idr does not conform to the canonical recognition motif for an sh domain yet binds with significant affinity to the c terminal sh domain of plc   sh c  the slp  py  motif competes with the autoinhibited conformation surrounding the sh c domain of plc  leading to exposure of the itk recognition element on the plc  sh domain and release of the target tyrosine y   these data contribute to the evolving model for the molecular events occurring early in the t cell activation process
