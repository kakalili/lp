the n terminal domain of  b crystallin resembles the putative ancestral homodimer edited by a r fersht
crystallins from the eye lens are proteins consisting of two similar domains joined by a short linker all three dimensional structures of native proteins solved so far reveal similar pseudo  fold pairing of the domains reflecting their presumed ancient origin from a single domain homodimer however studies of engineered single domains of members of the   crystallin superfamily have not revealed a prototype ancestral solution homodimer here we report the     x ray structure of the homodimer of the n terminal domain of rat  b crystallin  b n  the two identical domains pair in a symmetrical manner very similar to that observed in native   crystallins where n and c terminal domains which share    sequence identity are related by a pseudo  fold axis  b n thus resembles the ancestral prototype of the   crystallin superfamily as it self associates in solution to form a dimer with an essentially identical domain interface as that between the n and c domains in   crystallins but without the benefit of a covalent linker the structure provides further evidence for the role of two domain pairing in stabilising the protomer fold these results support the view that the   crystallin superfamily has evolved by a series of gene duplication and fusion events from a single domain ancestor capable of forming homodimers
