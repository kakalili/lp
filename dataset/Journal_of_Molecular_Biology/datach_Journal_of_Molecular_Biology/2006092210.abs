crystal structure of thermus thermophilus   pyrroline  carboxylate dehydrogenase
pyrroline  carboxylate dehydrogenase p cdh plays an important role in the metabolic pathway from proline to glutamate it irreversibly catalyzes the oxidation of glutamate  semialdehyde the product of the non enzymatic hydrolysis of   pyrroline  carboxylate into glutamate with the reduction of nad into nadh we have confirmed the p cdh activity of the thermus thermophilus protein tt   ttp cdh  and determined the crystal structure of the enzyme in the ligand free form at     resolution to investigate the structural basis of ttp cdh function the ttp cdh structures with nad  with nadh and with its product glutamate were determined at          and     resolution respectively the solved structures suggest an overall view of the p cdh catalytic mechanism and provide insights into the p cdh deficiencies in the case of the human type ii hyperprolinemia
