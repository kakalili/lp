dna unwinding step size of e coli recbcd helicase determined from single turnover chemical quenched flow kinetic studies
the mechanism by which escherichia coli recbcd dna helicase unwinds duplex dna was examined in vitro using pre steady state chemical quenched flow kinetic methods single turnover dna unwinding experiments were performed by addition of atp to recbcd that was pre bound to a series of dna substrates containing duplex dna regions ranging from  bp to  bp in each case the time course for formation of completely unwound dna displayed a distinct lag phase that increased with duplex length reflecting the transient formation of partially unwound dna intermediates during unwinding catalyzed by recbcd quantitative analysis of five independent sets of dna unwinding time courses indicates that recbcd unwinds duplex dna in discrete steps with an average unwinding  step size   m      bpstep   with an average unwinding rate of ku     stepss   mku     bps   at    c  mm mgcl   mm nacl ph      v v glycerol  however additional steps not linked directly to dna unwinding are also detected this kinetic dna unwinding step size is similar to that determined for the e coli uvrd helicase suggesting that these two sf superfamily helicases may share similar mechanisms of dna unwinding
