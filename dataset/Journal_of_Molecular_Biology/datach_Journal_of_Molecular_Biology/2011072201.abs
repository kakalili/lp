dynamics of preferential substrate recognition in hiv  protease redefining the substrate envelope
human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  protease pr permits viral maturation by processing the gag and gag pro pol polyproteins hiv  pr inhibitors pis are used in combination antiviral therapy but the emergence of drug resistance has limited their efficacy the rapid evolution of hiv  necessitates consideration of drug resistance in novel drug design drug resistant hiv  pr variants no longer inhibited efficiently continue to hydrolyze the natural viral substrates though highly diverse in sequence the hiv  pr substrates bind in a conserved three dimensional shape we termed the substrate envelope earlier we showed that resistance mutations arise where pis protrude beyond the substrate envelope because these regions are crucial for drug binding but not for substrate recognition we extend this model by considering the role of protein dynamics in the interaction of hiv  pr with its substrates we simulated the molecular dynamics of seven pr substrate complexes to estimate the conformational flexibility of the bound substrates interdependence of substrate  protease interactions might compensate for variations in cleavage site sequences and explain how a diverse set of sequences are recognized as substrates by the same enzyme this diversity might be essential for regulating sequential processing of substrates we define a dynamic substrate envelope as a more accurate representation of pr  substrate interactions this dynamic substrate envelope described by a probability distribution function is a powerful tool for drug design efforts targeting ensembles of resistant hiv  pr variants with the aim of developing drugs that are less susceptible to resistance
