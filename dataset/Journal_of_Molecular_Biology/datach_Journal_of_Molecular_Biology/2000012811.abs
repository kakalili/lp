x ray structures of small ligand fkbp complexes provide an estimate for hydrophobic interaction energies edited by r huber
a new crystal form of native fk  binding protein fkbp has been obtained which has proved useful in ligand binding studies three different small molecule ligand complexes and the native enzyme have been determined at higher resolution than     dissociation constants of the related small molecule ligands vary from  mm for dimethylsulphoxide to    m for tetrahydrothiophene  oxide comparison of the four available crystal structures shows that the protein structures are identical to within experimental error but there are differences in the water structure in the active site analysis of the calculated buried surface areas of these related ligands provides an estimated van der waals contribution to the binding energy of    kj   for non polar interactions between ligand and protein
