structural insights into the autoinhibition and posttranslational activation of histone methyltransferase smyd
the smyd family represents a new class of chromatin regulators that is important in heart and skeletal muscle development however the critical questions regarding how they are regulated posttranslationally remain largely unknown we previously suggested that the histone methyltransferase activity of smyd  a vital myogenic regulator appears to be regulated by autoinhibition and that the possible hinge motion of the conserved c terminal domain ctd might be central to the maintenance and release of the autoinhibition however the lack of direct evidence of the hinge motion has limited our further understanding of this autoinhibitory mechanism here we report the crystal structure of full length smyd in complex with the methyltransferase inhibitor sinefungin at     smyd has a two lobed structure with the substrate binding cleft located at the bottom of a     deep crevice formed between the n and c terminal lobes comparison of smyd and smyd clearly suggests that the ctd can undergo a large hinge bending motion that defines two distinct conformations smyd adopts a closed conformation with the ctd partially blocking the substrate binding cleft in contrast smyd appears to represent an open form where the ctd swings out by      from the n terminal lobe forming an open cleft with the active site completely exposed overall these findings provide novel structural insights into the mechanism that modulates the activity of the smyd proteins and support the observation that a posttranslational activation such as by molecular chaperon hsp  is required to potentiate the proteins
