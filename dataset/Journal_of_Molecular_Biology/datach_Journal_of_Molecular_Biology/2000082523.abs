temperature dependent equilibrium between the open and closed conformation of the p  subunit of hiv  reverse transcriptase revealed by site directed spin labelling edited by w baumeister
x ray crystallographic studies of human immunodeficiency virus type  reverse transcriptase complexed with or without substrates or inhibitors show that the heterodimeric enzyme adopts distinct conformations that differ in the orientation of the so called thumb subdomain in the large subunit site directed spin labelling of mutated residue positions w c and k  c is applied here to determine the distances between the fingers and thumb subdomains of liganded and unliganded rt in solution the inter spin distances of a dna dna and a pseudoknot rna complexed reverse transcriptase in solution was found to agree with the respective crystal data of the open and closed conformations for the unliganded reverse transcriptase a temperature dependent equilibrium between these two states was observed the fraction of the closed conformation decreased from   at   k to   at   k the spectral separation between the two structures was facilitated by the use of a perdeuterated  n nitroxide methane thiosulfonate spin label
