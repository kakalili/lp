Babesia divergens is the Apicomplexa agent of the bovine babesiosis in Europe: this infection leads to growth and lactation decrease, so that economical losses due to this parasite are sufficient to require the development of a vaccine. The major surface antigen of B. divergens has been described as a 37 kDa protein glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchored at the surface of the merozoite. The immuno-prophylactic potential of Bd37 has been demonstrated, and we present here the high-resolution solution structure of the 27 kDa structured core of Bd37 (Δ-Bd37) using NMR spectroscopy. A model for the whole protein has been obtained using additional small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data. The knowledge of the 3D structure of Bd37 allowed the precise epitope mapping of antibodies on its surface. Interestingly, the geometry of Δ-Bd37 reveals an intriguing similarity with the exocyst subunit Exo84p C-terminal region, an eukaryotic protein that has a direct implication in vesicle trafficking. This strongly suggests that Apicomplexa have developed in parallel molecular machines similar in structure and function to the ones used for endo- and exocytosis in eukaryotic cells.
