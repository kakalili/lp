the mechanical hierarchies of fibronectin observed with single molecule afm
mechanically induced conformational changes in proteins such as fibronectin are thought to regulate the assembly of the extracellular matrix and underlie its elasticity and extensibility fibronectin contains a region of tandem repeats of up to  type iii domains that play critical roles in cell binding and self assembly here we use single molecule force spectroscopy to examine the mechanical properties of fibronectin fn and its individual fniii domains we found that fibronectin is highly extensible due to the unfolding of its fniii domains we found that the native fniii region displays strong mechanical unfolding hierarchies requiring  pn of force to unfold the weakest domain and  pn for the most stable domain in an effort to determine the identity of the weakest strongest domain we engineered polyproteins composed of an individual domain and measured their mechanical stability by single protein atomic force microscopy afm techniques in contrast to chemical and thermal measurements of stability we found that the tenth fniii domain is mechanically the weakest and that the first and second fniii domains are the strongest moreover we found that the first fniii domain can acquire multiple partially folded conformations and that their incidence is modulated strongly by its neighbor fniii domain the mechanical hierarchies of fibronectin demonstrated here may be important for the activation of fibrillogenesis and matrix assembly
