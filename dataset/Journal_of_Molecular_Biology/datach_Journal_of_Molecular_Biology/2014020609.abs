destabilization of the homotetrameric assembly of  deoxy d arabino heptulosonate  phosphate synthase from the hyperthermophile pyrococcus furiosus enhances enzymatic activity
many proteins adopt homomeric quaternary structures to support their biological function including the first enzyme of the shikimate pathway that is ultimately responsible for the biosynthesis of the aromatic amino acids in plants and microorganisms this enzyme  deoxy d arabino heptulosonate  phosphate synthase dah ps  adopts a variety of different quaternary structures depending on the organism in which it is found the dah ps from the hyperthermophilic archaebacterium pyrococcus furiosus was previously shown to be tetrameric in its crystalline form and this quaternary association is confirmed in an improved structure in a different crystal system this tetramer is also present in solution as revealed by small angle x ray scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation this homotetrameric form has two distinct interfaces both of which bury over   each of the surface area of a single monomer substitution of ile for asp in the hydrophobic region of one interface gives a protein with a remarkable  fold higher maximum catalytic rate than the wild type enzyme analytical ultracentrifugation at ph  reveals that the tetrameric form is destabilized although the protein crystallizes as a tetramer equilibrium exists between tetrameric and dimeric forms with a dissociation constant of   m thus under the conditions of kinetic assay the enzyme is primarily dimeric revealing that the dimeric form is a fully functional catalyst however in comparison to the wild type protein the thermal stability of the dimeric protein is significantly compromised thus an unusual compromise of enzymatic activity versus stability is observed for this dah ps from an organism that favors a hyperthermophilic environment
