involvement of the second extracellular loop and transmembrane residues of ccr in inhibitor binding and hiv  fusion insights into the mechanism of allosteric inhibition
c c chemokine receptor  ccr  a member of g protein coupled receptors serves as a coreceptor for human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv   in the present study we examined the interactions between ccr and novel ccr inhibitors containing the spirodiketopiperazine scaffolds ak  and ak   both of which were lodged in the hydrophobic cavity located between the upper transmembrane domain and the second extracellular loop ecl  of ccr  although substantial differences existed between the two inhibitors  ak  had  fold greater ccr binding affinity kd   nm than ak      nm  their antiviral potencies were virtually identical ic    nm and   nm respectively  molecular dynamics simulations for unbound ccr showed hydrogen bond interactions among transmembrane residues y   e   and y   which were crucial for hiv  gp  scd complex binding and hiv  fusion indeed ak  and ak   when bound to ccr  disrupted these interhelix hydrogen bond interactions a salient molecular mechanism enabling allosteric inhibition mutagenesis and structural analysis showed that ecl consists of a part of the hydrophobic cavity for both inhibitors although ak  is more tightly engaged with ecl than ak   explaining their similar anti hiv  potencies despite the difference in kd values we also found that amino acid residues in the  hairpin structural motif of ecl are critical for hiv  elicited fusion and binding of the spirodiketopiperazine based inhibitors to ccr  the direct ecl engaging property of the inhibitors likely produces an ecl conformation which hiv  gp  cannot bind to but also prohibits hiv  from utilizing the  inhibitor bound  ccr for cellular entry  a mechanism of hiv  s resistance to ccr inhibitors the data should not only help delineate the dynamics of ccr following inhibitor binding but also aid in designing ccr inhibitors that are more potent against hiv  and prevent or delay the emergence of resistant hiv  variants
