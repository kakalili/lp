dinucleosome dna of human k  cells experimental and computational characterizations
dinucleosome formation is the first step in the organization of the higher order chromatin structure with the ultimate aim of elucidating the dinucleosome structure we constructed a library of human dinucleosome dna the library consists of pcr amplifiable dna fragments obtained by treatment of nuclei of erythroid k  cells with micrococcal nuclease followed by extraction of dna and adaptor ligation to the blunt ended dna fragments the library was then cloned using a plasmid vector and the sequences of the clones were determined the dominating clones containing the alu elements were removed a total of   clones which comprised a dinucleosome database contained  and   clones from the clones before and after removing alu elements respectively approximately   of the clones were between   and   bp in size and they were distributed to various locations of all chromosomes except the y chromosome the clones containing a n a n a or t n t n t sequences were classified into three types type i n shape  type ii v shape and type iii m shape according to dna curvature plots the locations of experimentally determined curved dna segments matched well with the calculated ones though the clones of types i and iii showed additional curved dna segments as revealed by the curvature plots the distributions of complementary dinucleotides in the nucleosome dna at the ends of the dinucleosome dna clones allowed us to predict the positions of the nucleosome dyad axis and estimate the size of the nucleosome core dna   nt the distributions of aa and tt dinucleotides as well as other rr and yy dinucleotides showed a periodicity with an average period of   bases close to the values observed before mapping of nucleosome positions in the dinucleosome database based on the observed periodicity revealed that the nucleosomes were separated by a linker of      nnt this indicates that the nucleosome  nucleosome orientations are typically halfway between parallel and antiparallel also an important finding is that the distributions of aa tt and other rr yy dinucleotides apparently reflect both dna curvature and dna bendability cooperatively contributing to the nucleosome formation
