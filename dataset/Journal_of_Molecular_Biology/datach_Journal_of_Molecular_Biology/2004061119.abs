effects of temperature and atp on the kinetic mechanism and kinetic step size for e coli recbcd helicase catalyzed dna unwinding
the kinetic mechanism by which escherichia coli recbcd helicase unwinds duplex dna was studied using a fluorescence stopped flow method single turnover dna unwinding experiments were performed using a series of fluorescently labeled dna substrates containing duplex dna regions ranging from  bp to  bp all or no dna unwinding time courses were obtained by monitoring the changes in fluorescence resonance energy transfer between a cy donor and cy acceptor fluorescent pair placed on opposite sides of a nick in the duplex dna from these experiments one can determine the average rates of dna unwinding as well as a kinetic step size defined as the average number of base pairs unwound between two successive rate limiting steps repeated during dna unwinding in order to probe how the kinetic step size might relate to a mechanical step size we performed single turnover experiments as a function of atp and temperature the apparent unwinding rate constant kuapp decreases with decreasing atp  exhibiting a hyperbolic dependence on atp  k        m and a maximum rate of kuapp     stepss   mkuapp     bps     mm mgcl   mm nacl ph      v v glycerol     c  kuapp also increases with increasing temperature      c  with ea    kcalmol   however the average kinetic step size m      bpstep   remains independent of atp and temperature this indicates that even though the values of the rate constants change the same elementary kinetic step in the unwinding cycle remains rate limiting over this range of conditions and this kinetic step remains coupled to atp binding the implications of the constancy of the measured kinetic step size for the mechanism of recbcd catalyzed dna unwinding are discussed
