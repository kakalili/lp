vrra mediates hfq dependent regulation of ompt synthesis in vibrio cholerae
ompt an outer membrane porin of vibrio cholerae is tightly regulated by the organism in response to different environments two transcriptional regulators camp receptor protein crp and toxr compete at the ompt promoter region crp activates ompt transcription by a loop forming mechanism while toxr functions as an antiactivator and repressor depending on its interplay with crp vrra a   nt small noncoding rna in v cholerae is controlled by the alternative sigma factor  e we have demonstrated previously that vrra represses ompa translation by base pairing with the   region of the mrna thereby affecting the release of outer membrane vesicles and modulating the colonization ability of v cholerae in this study we demonstrate that vrra rna represses ompt translation by base pairing with the   region of the mrna and that regulation requires the rna chaperone protein hfq these results add new insight into the regulation of ompt in addition to ph temperature signals via the toxr regulon and carbon source signals via the camp  crp complex ompt is further regulated by signals received via the  e regulon through vrra
