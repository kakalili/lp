the sequence of the rna primer and the dna template influence the initiation of plus strand dna synthesis in hepatitis b virus
for hepadnaviruses the rna primer for plus strand dna synthesis is generated by the final rnase h cleavage of the pregenomic rna at an   nt sequence called dr during the synthesis of minus strand dna this rna primer initiates synthesis at one of two distinct sites on the minus strand dna template resulting in two different end products duplex linear dna or relaxed circular dna duplex linear dna is made when initiation of synthesis occurs at dr  relaxed circular dna the major product is made when the rna primer translocates to the sequence complementary to dr  called dr before initiation of dna synthesis we studied the mechanism that determines the site of the final rnase h cleavage in hepatitis b virus hbv  we showed that the sites of the final rnase h cleavage are always a fixed number of nucleotides from the   end of the pregenomic rna this finding is similar to what was found previously for duck hepatitis b virus dhbv  and suggests that all hepadnaviruses use a similar mechanism also we studied the role of complementarity between the rna primer and the acceptor site at dr in hbv by increasing the complementarity we were able to increase the level of priming at dr over that seen in the wild type virus this finding suggests that the level of initiation of plus strand dna synthesis at dr is sub maximal for wild type hbv finally we studied the role of the sequence at the   end of the rna primer that is outside of the dr sequence we found that substitutions or insertions in this region affected the level of priming at dr and dr
