the crystal structure of c a the catalytic fragment of classical pathway c and c convertase of human complement
the multi domain serine protease c provides the catalytic activity for the c and c  convertases of the classical and lectin pathways of complement activation formation of these convertases requires the mg  dependent binding of c to c b and the subsequent cleavage of c by c s or masp  respectively the c terminal fragment c a consisting of a serine protease sp and a von willebrand factor type a vwfa domain remains attached to c b forming the c convertase c b a here we present the crystal structure of mg  bound c a to     resolution in comparison to its homolog bb the catalytic subunit of the alternative pathway c convertase c bbb although the overall domain arrangement of c a is similar to bb there are certain structural differences unexpectedly the conformation of the metal ion dependent adhesion site and the position of the   helix of the vwfa domain indicate a co factor bound or open conformation the active site of the sp domain is in a zymogen like inactive conformation on the basis of these structural features we suggest a model for the initial steps of c convertase assembly
