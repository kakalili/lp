There have been many studies about the effect of circular permutation on the transition state/folding nucleus of proteins, with sometimes conflicting conclusions from different proteins and permutations. To clarify this important issue, we have studied two circular permutations of a lattice protein model with side-chains. Both permuted sequences have essentially the same native state as the original (wild-type) sequence. Circular permutant 1 cuts at the folding nucleus of the wild-type sequence. As a result, the permutant has a drastically different nucleus and folds more slowly than wild-type. In contrast, circular permutant 2 involves an incision at a site unstructured in the wild-type transition state, and the wild-type nucleus is largely retained in the permutant. In addition, permutant 2 displays both two-state and multi-state folding, with a native-like intermediate state occasionally populated. Neither the wild-type nor permutant 1 has a similar intermediate, and both fold in an apparently two-state manner. Surprisingly, permutant 2 folds at a rate identical with that of the wild-type. The intermediate in permutant 2 is stabilised by native and non-native interactions, and cannot be classified simply as on or off-pathway. So we advise caution in attributing experimental data to on or off-pathway intermediates. Finally, our work illuminates the results on α-spectrin SH3, chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 and β-lactoglobulin, and supports a key assumption in the experimental efforts to locate potential nucleation sites of real proteins via circular permutations.
