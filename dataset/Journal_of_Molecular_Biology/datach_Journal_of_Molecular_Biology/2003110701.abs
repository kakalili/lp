ph dependent amyloid and protofibril formation by the abri peptide of familial british dementia
the abri is a  residue peptide that is the major component of amyloid deposits in familial british dementia in the amyloid deposits the abri peptide adopts aggregated  pleated sheet structures similar to those formed by the a  peptide of alzheimer s disease and other amyloid forming proteins as a first step toward elucidating the molecular mechanisms of the  amyloidosis we explored the ability of the environmental variables ph and peptide concentration to promote  sheet fibril structures for synthetic abri peptides the secondary structures and fibril morphology were characterized in parallel using circular dichroism atomic force microscopy negative stain electron microscopy congo red and thioflavin t fluorescence spectroscopic techniques as seen with other amyloid proteins the abri fibrils had characteristic binding with congo red and thioflavin t and the relative amounts of  sheet and amyloid fibril like structures are influenced strongly by ph in the acidic ph range      the abri peptide adopts almost exclusively random structure and a predominantly monomeric aggregation state on the basis of analytical ultracentrifugation measurements at neutral ph       the abri peptide had limited solubility and produced spherical and amorphous aggregates with predominantly  sheet secondary structure whereas at slightly acidic ph    spherical aggregates intermediate sized protofibrils and larger sized mature amyloid fibrils were detected by atomic force microscopy with aging at ph   the protofibrils underwent further association and eventually formed mature fibrils the presence of small amounts of aggregated peptide material or seeds encourage fibril formation at neutral ph suggesting that generation of such seeds in vivo could promote amyloid formation at slightly basic ph    scrambling of the cys  cys  disulfide bond occurred which could lead to the formation of covalently linked aggregates the presence of the protofibrils and the enhanced aggregation at slightly acidic ph is consistent with the behavior of other amyloid forming proteins which supports the premise that a common mechanism may be involved in protein misfolding and  amyloidosis
