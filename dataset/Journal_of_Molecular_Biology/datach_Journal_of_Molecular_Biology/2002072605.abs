folding mechanism of indole  glycerol phosphate synthase from sulfolobus solfataricus a test of the conservation of folding mechanisms hypothesis in     barrels
as a test of the hypothesis that folding mechanisms are better conserved than sequences in tim barrels the equilibrium and kinetic folding mechanisms of indole  glycerol phosphate synthase sigps from the thermoacidophilic archaebacterium sulfolobus solfataricus were compared to the well characterized models of the alpha subunit of tryptophan synthase  ts from escherichia coli a multifaceted approach combining urea denaturation and far uv circular dichroism tyrosine fluorescence total intensity and tyrosine fluorescence anisotropy was employed despite a sequence identity of only   a stable intermediate i in sigps was found to be similar to a stable intermediate in  ts in terms of its thermodynamic properties and secondary structure kinetic experiments revealed that the fastest detectable folding event for sigps involves a burst phase  lt ms reaction that leads directly to the stable intermediate the slower of two subsequent phases reflects the formation disruption of an off pathway dimeric form of i the faster phase reflects the conversion of i to the native state and is limited by folding under marginally stable conditions and by isomerization or rearrangement under strongly folding conditions by contrast  ts is thought to fold via an off pathway burst phase intermediate whose unfolding controls access to a set of four on pathway intermediates that comprise the stable equilibrium intermediate at least three proline isomerization reactions are known to limit their interconversions and lead to a parallel channel mechanism the simple sequential mechanism deduced for sigps reflects the dominance of the on pathway burst phase intermediate and the absence of prolyl residues that partition the stable intermediate into kinetically distinguishable species comparison of the results for sigps and  ts demonstrates that the thermodynamic properties and the final steps of the folding reaction are better conserved than the early events the initial events in folding appear to be more sensitive to the sequence differences between the two tim barrel proteins
