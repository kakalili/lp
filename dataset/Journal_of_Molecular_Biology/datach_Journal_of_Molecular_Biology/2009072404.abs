modulating the mechanical stability of extracellular matrix protein tenascin c in a controlled and reversible fashion
stretching force can induce conformational changes of proteins and is believed to be an important biological signal in the mechanotransduction network tenascin c is a large extracellular matrix protein and is subject to stretching force under its physiological condition regulating the mechanical properties of the fibronectin type iii domains of tenascin c will alter its response to mechanical stretching force and thus may provide the possibility of regulating the biological activities of tenascin c in living cells however tuning the mechanical stability of proteins in a rational and systematic fashion remains challenging using the third fibronectin type iii domain tnfn  of tenascin c as a model system here we report a successful engineering of a mechanically stronger extracellular matrix protein via engineered metal chelation combining steered molecular dynamics simulations protein engineering and single molecule atomic force microscopy we have rationally engineered a bihistidine based metal chelation site into tnfn  we used its metal chelation capability to selectively increase the unfolding energy barrier for the rate limiting step during the mechanical unfolding of tnfn  the resultant tnfn mutant exhibits enhanced mechanical stability using a stronger metal chelator one can convert tnfn back to a state of lower mechanical stability this is the first step toward engineering extracellular matrix proteins with defined mechanical properties which can be modulated reversibly by external stimuli and will provide the possibility of using external stimuli to regulate the biological functions of extracellular matrix proteins
