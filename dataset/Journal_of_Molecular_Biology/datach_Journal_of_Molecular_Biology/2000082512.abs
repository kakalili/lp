crystal structures of b dna reveal sequence specific binding and groove specific bending of dna by magnesium and calcium edited by i tinoco
the   resolution x ray crystal structures of mg  and ca  salts of the b dna decamers ccaacgttgg and ccagcgctgg reveal sequence specific binding of mg  and ca  to the major and minor grooves of dna as well as non specific binding to backbone phosphate oxygen atoms minor groove binding involves h bond interactions between cross strand dna base atoms of adjacent base pairs and the cations  water ligands in the major groove the cations  water ligands can interact through h bonds with o and n atoms from either one base or adjacent bases and in addition the softer ca  can form polar covalent bonds bridging adjacent n and o atoms at gg bases for reasons outlined earlier localized monovalent cations are neither expected nor found ultra high atomic resolution gives an unprecedented view of hydration in both grooves of dna permits an analysis of individual anisotropic displacement parameters and reveals up to  divalent cations per dna duplex each dna helix is quite anisotropic and alternate conformations with motion in the direction of opening and closing the minor groove are observed for the sugar phosphate backbone taking into consideration the variability of experimental parameters and crystal packing environments among these four helices and  other mg  and ca  bound b dna structures we conclude that sequence specific and strand specific binding of mg  and ca  to the major groove causes dna bending by base roll compression towards the major groove while sequence specific binding of mg  and ca  in the minor groove has a negligible effect on helix curvature the minor groove opens and closes to accommodate mg  and ca  without the necessity for significant bending of the overall helix the program shelxdna was written to facilitate refinement and analysis of x ray crystal structures by shelxl  and to plot and analyze one or more curves and freehelix output files
