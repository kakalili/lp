an overview of macroautophagy in yeast
macroautophagy is an evolutionarily conserved dynamic pathway that functions primarily in a degradative manner a basal level of macroautophagy occurs constitutively but this process can be further induced in response to various types of stress including starvation hypoxia and hormonal stimuli the general principle behind macroautophagy is that cytoplasmic contents can be sequestered within a transient double membrane organelle an autophagosome which subsequently fuses with a lysosome or vacuole in mammals or yeast and plants respectively  allowing for degradation of the cargo followed by recycling of the resulting macromolecules through this basic mechanism macroautophagy has a critical role in cellular homeostasis however either insufficient or excessive macroautophagy can seriously compromise cell physiology and thus it needs to be properly regulated in fact a wide range of diseases are associated with dysregulation of macroautophagy there has been substantial progress in understanding the regulation and molecular mechanisms of macroautophagy in different organisms however many questions concerning some of the most fundamental aspects of macroautophagy remain unresolved in this review we summarize current knowledge about macroautophagy mainly in yeast including the mechanism of autophagosome biogenesis the function of the core macroautophagic machinery the regulation of macroautophagy and the process of cargo recognition in selective macroautophagy with the goal of providing insights into some of the key unanswered questions in this field
