role of tryptophan residues in the recognition of mutagenic oxidized nucleotides by human antimutator mth protein
the human mth antimutator protein hydrolyzes mutagenic oxidized nucleotides and thus prevents their incorporation into dna and any subsequent mutation we have examined its great selectivity for oxidized nucleotides by analyzing the structure of the protein and its interaction with nucleotides as reflected in the fluorescence of its tryptophan residues the binding of nucleotides decreased the intensity of mth protein fluorescence and red shifted the emission peak indicating that at least one tryptophan residue is close to the binding site oxidized nucleotides  oh datp and  oxo dgtp produced a larger decrease in fluorescence intensity than did unoxidized nucleotides and mth protein had a much higher binding affinity for oxidized nucleotides deconvolution of protein fluorescence by comparison of its quenching by positively cs  and negatively i   charged ions indicated that the mth tryptophan residues are in two different environments one class of tryptophan residues is exposed to solvent but in a negatively charged environment the other class is partially buried while the binding of unoxidized nucleotides quenches the fluorescence of only class  tryptophan residue s  the binding of oxidized nucleotides quenched that of class  tryptophan residue s as well this suggests that selectivity is due to additional contact between the protein and the oxidized nucleotide mutation analysis indicated that the tryptophan residue at position   which is in a negative environment is in contact with nucleotides the negatively charged residues in the binding site probably correlate with the finding that nucleotide binding requires metal ions and depends upon their nature positively charged metal ions probably act by neutralizing the negatively charged nucleotide phosphate groups
