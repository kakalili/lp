crystal structures of the rhodococcus proteasome with and without its pro peptides implications for the role of the pro peptide in proteasome assembly
to understand the role of the pro peptide in proteasome assembly we have determined structures of the rhodococcus proteasome and a mutant form that prevents the autocatalytic removal of its pro peptides the structures reveal that the pro peptide acts as an assembly promoting factor by linking its own  subunit to two adjacent  subunits thereby providing a molecular explanation for the observed kinetics of proteasome assembly the rhodococcus proteasome has been found to have a substantially smaller contact region between  subunits compared to those regions in the proteasomes of thermoplasma yeast and mammalian cells suggesting that a smaller contact area between  subunits is likely the structural basis for the rhodococcus  subunits not assembling into  rings when expressed alone analysis of all available  subunit structures shows that the contact area between  subunits within a  ring is not sufficient for  ring self assembly without the additional contact provided by the  ring this appears to be a fail safe mechanism ensuring that the active sites on the  subunits are activated only after proteasome assembly is complete
