application of the diffusion  collision model to the folding of three helix bundle proteins
the diffusion  collision model has been successful in explaining many features of protein folding kinetics particularly for helical proteins in the model the folding reaction is described in terms of coupled chemical kinetic master equations of coarse grained entities called microdomains here the diffusion  collision model is applied to compute the folding kinetics of four three helix bundle proteins all of which fold on a time scale of tens of microseconds and appear to have two state folding the native structure and the stability of the helical microdomains are used to determine the parameters of the model the formulation allows computation of the overall rate and determination of the importance of kinetic intermediates the proteins considered are the b domain of protein a  bdc  the engrailed homeodomain  enh  the peripheral sub unit binding domain  ebd c chain and the villin headpiece subdomain  vii  the results for the folding time of protein a the engrailed homeodomain and ebd c chain are in agreement with experiment while vii is not stable in the present model in the three proteins that are stable two state folding is predicted by the diffusion  collision model this disagrees with published assertions that multistate kinetics would be obtained from the model the contact order prediction agrees with experiment for protein a but yields values that are a factor of    and  too slow for enh  ebd c chain and vii the effect of mutants on folding is described for protein a and it is demonstrated that significant intermediate concentrations i e deviation from two state folding can occur if the stability of some of the helical microdomains is increased a linear relationship between folding time and the length of the loop between helices b and c in protein a is demonstrated this is not evident in the contact order description
