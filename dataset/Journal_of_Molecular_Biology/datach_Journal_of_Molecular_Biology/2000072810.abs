pvuii endonuclease contains two calcium ions in active sites edited by a r fersht
restriction endonucleases differ in their use of metal cofactors despite having remarkably similar folds for their catalytic regions to explore this we have characterized the interaction of endonuclease pvuii with the catalytically incompetent cation ca  the structure of a glutaraldehyde crosslinked crystal of the endonuclease pvuii dna complex determined in the presence of ca  at a ph of approximately   supports a two metal mechanism of dna cleavage by pvuii the first ca  position matches that found in all structurally examined endonucleases while the second position is similar to that of ecorv but is distinct from that of bamhi and bgli the location of the second metal in pvuii unlike that in bamhi bgli permits no direct interaction between the second metal and the o   oxygen leaving group however the interactions between the dna scissile phosphate and the metals the first metal and the attacking water and the attacking water and dna are the same in pvuii as they are in the two metal models of bamhi and bgli but are distinct from the proposed three metal or the two metal models of ecorv
