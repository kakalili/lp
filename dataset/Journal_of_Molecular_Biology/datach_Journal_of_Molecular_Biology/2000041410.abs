structure of the coat protein binding domain of the scaffolding protein from a double stranded dna virus edited by m summers
scaffolding proteins are required for high fidelity assembly of most high t number dsdna viruses such as the large bacteriophages and the herpesvirus family they function by transiently binding and positioning the coat protein subunits during capsid assembly in both bacteriophage p  and the herpesviruses the extreme scaffold c terminus is highly charged is predicted to be an amphipathic  helix and is sufficient to bind the coat protein suggesting a common mode of action nmr studies show that the coat protein binding domain of p  scaffolding protein exhibits a helix loop helix motif stabilized by a hydrophobic core one face of the motif is characterized by a high density of positive charges that could interact with the coat protein through electrostatic interactions results from previous studies with a truncation fragment and the observed salt sensitivity of the assembly process are explained by the nmr structure
