disulfide bond stabilization of the hexameric capsomer of human immunodeficiency virus
the human immunodeficiency virus type  capsid is modeled as a fullerene cone that is composed of    hexamers and  pentamers of the viral ca protein structures of ca hexamers have been difficult to obtain because the hexamer stabilizing interactions are inherently weak and ca tends to spontaneously assemble into capsid like particles here we describe a two step biochemical strategy to obtain soluble ca hexamers for crystallization first the hexamer was stabilized by engineering disulfide cross links either a c e c or a c t c between the n terminal domains of adjacent subunits second the cross linked hexamers were prevented from polymerizing further into hyperstable capsid like structures by mutations w  a and m  a that interfered with dimeric association between the c terminal domains that link adjacent hexamers the structures of two different cross linked ca hexamers were nearly identical and we combined the non mutated portions of the structures to generate an atomic resolution model for the native hexamer this hybrid approach for structure determination should be applicable to other viral capsomers and protein  protein complexes in general
