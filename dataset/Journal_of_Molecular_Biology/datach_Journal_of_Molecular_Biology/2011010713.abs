evolution of i scei homing endonucleases with increased dna recognition site specificity
elucidating how homing endonucleases undergo changes in recognition site specificity will facilitate efforts to engineer proteins for gene therapy applications i scei is a monomeric homing endonuclease that recognizes and cleaves within an  bp target it tolerates limited degeneracy in its target sequence including substitution of a c g  base pair for the wild type a t  base pair libraries encoding randomized amino acids at i scei residue positions that contact or are proximal to a t  were used in conjunction with a bacterial one hybrid system to select i scei derivatives that bind to recognition sites containing either the a t  or the c g  base pairs as expected isolates encoding wild type residues at the randomized positions were selected using either target sequence all i scei proteins isolated using the c g  recognition site included small side chain substitutions at g  and either contained k r g  t k r g  s and k r g  c or lacked g  a g  t a k r substitution interestingly the binding affinities of the selected variants for the wild type a t  target are  to  fold lower than that of wild type i scei whereas those for the c g  target are similar the increased specificity of the mutant proteins is also evident in binding experiments in vivo these differences in binding affinities account for the observed    fold difference in target preference between the k r g  t and wild type proteins in dna cleavage assays an x ray crystal structure of the k r g  t mutant protein bound to a dna duplex containing the c g  substitution suggests how sequence specificity of a homing enzyme can increase this biochemical and structural analysis defines one pathway by which site specificity is augmented for a homing endonuclease
