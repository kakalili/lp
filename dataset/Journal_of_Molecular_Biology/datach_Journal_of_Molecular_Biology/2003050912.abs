structural and functional defects caused by point mutations in the  crystallin domain of a bacterial  heat shock protein
the diverse family of  crystallin type small heat shock proteins   hsps or shsps is characterised by a central moderately conserved  crystallin domain oligomerisation followed by dissociation of subparticles is thought to be a prerequisite for chaperone function we demonstrate that hsph a bacterial  hsp from the soybean symbiont bradyrhizobium japonicum assembles into dynamic complexes freely exchanging subunits with homologous and heterologous complexes the importance of the  crystallin domain for oligomerisation and chaperone activity was tested by site directed mutagenesis of  different residues in contrast to mammalian  hsps the majority of these mutations elicited severe structural and functional defects in hsph the individual exchange of five amino acid residues throughout the  crystallin domain was found to compromise oligomerisation to various degrees assembly defects resulting in complexes of reduced size correlated with greatly decreased or abolished chaperone activity reinforcing that complete oligomerisation is required for functionality mutation of a highly conserved glycine g   at the c terminal end of the  crystallin domain specifically impaired chaperone activity without interfering with oligomerisation properties indicating that this residue is critical for substrate interaction the structural and functional importance of this and other residues is discussed in the context of a modeled three dimensional structure of hsph
