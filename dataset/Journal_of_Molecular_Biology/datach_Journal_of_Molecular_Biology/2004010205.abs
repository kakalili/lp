reinitiation and recycling are distinct processes occurring downstream of translation termination in yeast
the circularisation model of the polysome suggests that ribosome recycling is facilitated by       interactions mediated by the cap binding complex eif f and the poly a binding protein pab  alternatively downstream of a short upstream open reading frame uorf in the   untranslated region of a gene posttermination ribosomes can maintain the competence to re initiate translation our data show that recycling and reinitiation must be distinct processes in saccharomyces cerevisiae the role of the   utr in recycling was assessed by restricting ribosome movement along the mrna using a poly g stretch or the mammalian iron regulatory protein bound to the iron responsive element we find that although   utr structure can influence translation the main pathway of ribosome recycling does not depend on scanning like movement through the   utr changes in termination kinetics or disruption of the pab  eif f interaction do not affect recycling yet the maintenance of normal in vivo mrnp structure is important to this process using bicistronic act luc constructs elongating yeast ribosomes were found to maintain the competence to re initiate over only short distances thus as the first orf to be translated is progressively truncated reinitiation downstream of an uorf of  nt is found to be just detectable and increases markedly in efficiency as uorf length is reduced to  nt experiments using a strain mutated in the cca nucleotidyltransferase suggest that the uorf length dependence of changes in reinitiation competence is affected by peptide elongation kinetics but that orf length per se may also be relevant
