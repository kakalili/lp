neddylation induced conformational control regulates cullin ring ligase activity in vivo
cullin ring ligases crls constitute the largest family of ubiquitin ligases with diverse cellular functions conjugation of the ubiquitin like molecule nedd to a conserved lysine residue on the cullin scaffold is essential for the activity of crls using structural studies and in vitro assays it has been demonstrated that neddylation stimulates crl activity through conformational rearrangement of the cullin c terminal winged helix b domain and rbx ring subdomain from a closed architecture to an open and dynamic structure thus promoting ubiquitin transfer onto the substrate here we tested whether the proposed mechanism operates in vivo in intact cells and applies to other crl family members to inhibit cellular neddylation we used a cell line with tetracycline inducible expression of a dominant negative form of the nedd e enzyme or treatment of cells with the nedd e inhibitor mln   using these cellular systems we show that different mutants of cul and cul and of rbx that confer increased rbx flexibility mimic neddylation and rescue crl activity in intact cells our findings indicate that in vivo neddylation functions by inducing conformational changes in the c terminal domain of cul and cul that free the ring domain of rbx and bridge the gap for ubiquitin transfer onto the substrate
