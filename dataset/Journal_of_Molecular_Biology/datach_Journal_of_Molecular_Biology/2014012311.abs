cooperative kaia  kaib  kaic interactions affect kaib sasa competition in the circadian clock of cyanobacteria
the circadian oscillator of cyanobacteria is composed of only three proteins kaia kaib and kaic together they generate an autonomous   h biochemical rhythm of phosphorylation of kaic kaia stimulates kaic phosphorylation by binding to the so called a loops of kaic whereas kaib sequesters kaia in a kaiabc complex far away from the a loops thereby inducing kaic dephosphorylation the switch from kaic phosphorylation to dephosphorylation is initiated by the formation of the kaib  kaic complex which occurs upon phosphorylation of the s  residues of kaic we show here that formation of the kaib  kaic complex is promoted by kaia suggesting cooperativity in the initiation of the dephosphorylation complex in the kaia  kaib interaction one monomeric subunit of kaib likely binds to one face of a kaia dimer leaving the other face unoccupied we also show that the a loops of kaic exist in a dynamic equilibrium between kaia accessible exposed and kaia inaccessible buried positions phosphorylation at the s  residues of kaic shift the a loops toward the buried position thereby weakening the kaia  kaic interaction which is expected to be an additional mechanism promoting formation of the kaiabc complex we also show that kaib and the clock output protein sasa compete for overlapping binding sites which include the b loops on the ci ring of kaic kaia strongly shifts the competition in kaib s favor thus in addition to stimulating kaic phosphorylation it is likely that kaia plays roles in switching kaic from phosphorylation to dephosphorylation as well as regulating clock output
