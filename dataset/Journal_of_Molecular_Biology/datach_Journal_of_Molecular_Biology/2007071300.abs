computational characterization of structural role of the non active site mutation m i of human immunodeficiency virus type  protease
a prominent characteristic of human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  is its high genetic variability which generates diversity of the virus and often causes a serious problem of the emergence of drug resistant mutants subtype b hiv  is dominant in advanced countries and the mortality rate due to subtype b hiv  has been decreased during the past decade in contrast the number of patients with non subtype b viruses is still increasing in developing countries one of the reasons for the prevalence of non subtype b viruses is lack of information about the biological and therapeutic differences between subtype b and non subtype b viruses m i is the most frequently observed polymorphism in non subtype b hiv  proteases however since the  th residue is located at a non active site of the protease and has no direct interaction with any ligands the structural role of m i remains unclear here we performed molecular dynamics md simulations of m i protease in complex with nelfinavir and revealed the influence of the m i mutation the results show that m i regulates the size of the binding cavity of the protease the reason for the rare emergence of d n variants in non subtype b hiv  proteases was also clarified from our computational analysis
