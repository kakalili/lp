conformational changes induced by binding udp f galactose to    galactosyltransferase implications for catalysis
galactosyltransferase   gt catalyzes the transfer of galactose from udp galactose to  linked galactosides with retention of its  configuration although several complexes of  gt with inhibitors and substrates have been reported no structure has been determined of a complex containing intact udp galactose we describe the structure of a complex containing an inhibitory analogue of udp galactose udp f galactose in a complex with the arg  lys mutant of  gt the inhibitor is bound in a distorted bent configuration and comparison with the structure of the apo form of this mutant shows that the interaction induces structural changes in the enzyme implying a role for ground state destabilization in catalysis in addition to a general reduction in flexibility in the enzyme indicated by a large reduction in crystallographic b factors two loops one centred around trp  and one encompassing the c terminal  residues undergo large structural changes in complexes with udp and udp derivatives the distorted configuration of the bound udp f galactose in its complex is stabilized in part by interactions with residues that are part of or near the flexible loops mutagenesis and truncation studies indicate that two highly conserved basic amino acid residues in the c terminal region lys  and arg  are important for catalysis probably reflecting their roles in these ligand mediated conformational changes a second mn  cofactor has been identified in the catalytic site of a complex of the arg  lys with udp in a location that suggests it could play a role in facilitating udp release consistent with kinetic studies that show  gt activity depends on the binding of two manganese ions conformational changes in the c terminal  residues require an initial reorganization of the trp  loop and are linked to enzyme progress through the catalytic cycle including donor substrate distortion cleavage of the udp  galactose bond galactose transfer and udp release
