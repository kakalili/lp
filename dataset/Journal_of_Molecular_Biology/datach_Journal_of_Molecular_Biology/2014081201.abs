topology dimerization and stability of the single span membrane protein cadc
under acid stress escherichia coli induce expression of cada lysine decarboxylase and cadb lysine cadaverine antiporter in a lysine rich environment the toxr like transcriptional activator cadc controls expression of the cadba operon using a novel signal peptidase i spase i cleavage assay we show that cadc is a type ii single span membrane protein s smp with a cytoplasmic dna binding domain and a periplasmic sensor domain we further show that as long assumed dimerization of the sensor domain is required for activating the cadba operon we prove this using a chimera in which the periplasmic domain of rodz  a type ii membrane protein involved in the maintenance of the rod shape of e coli  replaces the cadc sensor domain because the rodz periplasmic domain cannot dimerize the chimera cannot activate the operon however replacement of the transmembrane tm domain of the chimera with the glycophorin a tm domain causes intramembrane dimerization and consequently operon activation using a low expression protocol that eliminates extraneous tm helix dimerization signals arising from protein over expression we enhanced dramatically the dynamic range of the  galactosidase assay for cadba activation consequently the strength of the intramembrane dimerization of the glycophorin a domain could be compared quantitatively with the strength of the much stronger periplasmic dimerization of cadc for the signal peptidase assay we inserted an spase i cleavage site aaa or aqa at the periplasmic end of the tm helix cleavage occurred with high efficiency for all tm and periplasmic domains tested thus eliminating the need for the cumbersome spheroplast proteinase k method for topology determinations
