identification and structural characterization of a cbp p  binding domain from the ets family transcription factor gabp
using nmr spectroscopy we identified and characterized a previously unrecognized structured domain near the n terminus residues      of the ets family transcription factor gabp  the monomeric domain folds as a five stranded  sheet crossed by a distorted helix although globally resembling ubiquitin the gabp  fragment differs in its secondary structure topology and thus appears to represent a new protein fold that we term the ost on sight domain the surface of the gabp  ost domain contains two predominant clusters of negatively charged residues suggestive of electrostatically driven interactions with positively charged partner proteins following a best candidate approach to identify such a partner we demonstrated through nmr monitored titrations and glutathione s transferase pulldown assays that the ost domain binds to the ch and ch domains of the co activator histone acetyltransferase cbp p   this provides a direct structural link between gabp and a central component of the transcriptional machinery
