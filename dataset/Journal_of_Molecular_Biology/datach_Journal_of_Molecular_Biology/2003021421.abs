characterization of mutations in the gtp binding domain of if resulting in cold sensitive growth of escherichia coli
the infb gene encodes translation initiation factor if  we have determined the entire sequence of infb from two cold sensitive escherichia coli strains iq  and iq   these two strains have been isolated as suppressor strains for the temperature sensitive secretion mutation secy  the mutations causing the suppression phenotype are located within infb the only variations from the wild type wt infb found in the two mutant strains are a replacement of asp  with glu in strain iq  and an insertion of gly between ala  and gly  in strain iq   both positions are located in the gtp binding g domain of if  a model of the g domain of e coli if is presented in figure  physiological quantities of the recombinant mutant proteins were expressed in vivo in e coli strains from which the chromosomal infb gene has been inactivated at   c the mutants sustained normal cell growth whereas a significant decrease in growth rate was found at   c for both mutants as compared to wt if expressed in the control strain circular dichroism spectra were recorded of the wt and the two mutant proteins to investigate the structural properties of the proteins the spectra are characteristic of  helix dominated structure and reveal a significant different behavior between the wt and mutant if s with respect to temperature induced conformational changes the temperature induced conformational change of the wt if is a two state process in a ribosome dependent gtpase assay in vitro the two mutants showed practically no activity at temperatures below   c and a reduced activity at all temperatures up to   c as compared to wt if  the results indicate that the amino acid residues asp  and gly   are located in important regions of the if g domain and demonstrate the importance of gtp hydrolysis in translation initiation for optimal cell growth
