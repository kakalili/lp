mutual interdependence of msi  cac  and yak in saccharomyces cerevisiae
the msi  cac  gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae has been implicated in diverse cellular functions including suppression of the ras camp protein kinase a signaling pathway chromatin assembly and transcriptional co repression seeking to identify the molecular mechanisms by which msi p carries out these distinct activities a novel genetic interaction was uncovered with yak  which encodes a kinase that antagonizes the ras camp pathway msi was capable of efficiently suppressing the heat shock sensitivity caused by deletion of yak  surprisingly the yak gene is required for msi p to associate with cac p in the yeast two hybrid system a new activity of msi p was identified the ability to activate transcription of a reporter gene when tethered near the promoter but only in the absence of fermentable carbon sources this transcriptional activation function was diminished substantially by the loss of yak  furthermore msi influences yak function over expression of yak decreased the growth rate but only in the presence of a functional msi gene finally it is shown that yak antagonizes nuclear accumulation of msi p in non fermenting cells taken together these data demonstrate a novel interaction between msi p and yak p in which each protein influences the activity of the other
