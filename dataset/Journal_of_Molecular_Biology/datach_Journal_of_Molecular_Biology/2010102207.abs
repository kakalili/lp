carboxyl pka values and acid denaturation of bbl
the protein bbl undergoes structural transitions and acid denaturation between ph   and   using nmr spectroscopy we measured the pka values of all the carboxylic residues in this ph range we employed  c direct detection two dimensional ipap in phase antiphase caco nmr spectroscopy to monitor the ionization state of different carboxylic groups and demonstrated its advantages over other nmr techniques in measuring pka values of carboxylic residues the two residues glu  and asp  had significantly lowered pka values showing that these residues are involved in a network of stabilizing electrostatic interactions as is his   the other carboxylates had unperturbed values the ph dependence of the free energy of denaturation was described quantitatively by the ionizations of those three residues of perturbed pka and using thermodynamic cycles we could calculate their pkas in the native and denatured states as well as the equilibrium constants for denaturation of the different protonation states we also measured  c  chemical shifts of individual residues as a function of ph these shifts sense structural transitions rather than ionizations and they titrated with ph consistent with the change in equilibrium constant for denaturation kinetic measurements of the folding of bbl e  q indicated that at ph   the stabilizing interactions with glu  are formed mainly in the transition state we also found that local interactions still exist in the acid denatured state of bbl which attenuate somewhat the flexibility of the acid denatured state
