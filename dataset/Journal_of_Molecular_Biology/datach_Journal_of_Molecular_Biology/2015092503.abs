the lcrg tip chaperone protein of the yersinia pestis type iii secretion system is partially folded
the type iii secretion system t ss is essential in the pathogenesis of yersinia pestis the causative agent of plague a small protein lcrg functions as a chaperone to the tip protein lcrv and the lcrg  lcrv interaction is important in regulating protein secretion through the t ss the atomic structure of the lcrg family is currently unknown however because of its predicted helical propensity many have suggested that the lcrg family forms a coiled coil structure here we show by nmr and cd spectroscopy that lcrg lacks a tertiary structure and it consists of three partially folded  helices spanning residues         and     nmr titrations of lcrg with lcrv show that the entire length of a truncated lcrg residues     is involved in binding to lcrv however there is regional variation in how lcrg binds to lcrv the c terminal region of a truncated lcrg residues     shows tight binding interaction with lcrv while the n terminal region residues     shows weaker interaction with lcrv this suggests that there are at least two binding events when lcrg binds to lcrv biological assays and mutagenesis indicate that the c terminal region of lcrg residues     is important in blocking protein secretion through the t ss our results reveal structural and mechanistic insights into the atomic conformation of lcrg and how it binds to lcrv
