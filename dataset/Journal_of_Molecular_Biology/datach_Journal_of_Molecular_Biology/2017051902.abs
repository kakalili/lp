insights into the establishment of chromatin states in pluripotent cells from studies of x inactivation
animal development entails the sequential and coordinated specialization of cells during cell differentiation transcription factors cell signaling pathways and chromatin associated protein complexes cooperate in regulating the expression of a large number of genes here we review the present understanding of the establishment of chromatin states by focusing on x chromosome inactivation xci as a model for facultative heterochromatin formation in female embryonic cells the inactive x chromosome is large enough to be investigated by biochemical and microscopy techniques in addition the ability to compare the inactivated chromatin to the active x in male cells enables us to differentiate events specific to gene silencing during xci from gene regulatory effects from changing pathways in the same cell findings in xci are useful as blueprints for investigation of the action of epigenetic pathways in differentiation and lineage commitment we summarize recent studies that have identified factors that are critical for chromosome wide gene repression in xci and we discuss their implications for epigenetic regulation in pluripotent cells of the early embryo
