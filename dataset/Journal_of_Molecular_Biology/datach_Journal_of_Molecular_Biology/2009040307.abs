inhibition of rna polymerase iii transcription by brca
rna polymerase iii rna pol iii transcribes structural rnas involved in rna processing u snrna and translation trna  thereby regulating the growth rate of cells proper initiation by rna pol iii requires the transcription factor tfiiib gene external u snrna transcription requires tfiiib consisting of bdp  tbp and brf  transcription from the gene internal trna promoter requires tfiiib composed of bdp  tbp and brf  tfiiib is a target of tumor suppressors including pten arf p  and rb and rb related pocket proteins breast cancer susceptibility gene  brca  tumor suppressor plays a role in dna repair cell cycle regulation apoptosis genome integrity and ubiquitination brca has a conserved amino terminal ring domain an activation domain  ad  and an acidic carboxyl terminal domain brca c terminal region  in saccharomyces cerevisiae tfiib interacts with the brca c terminal region domain of fcp p an rna polymerase ii phosphatase the tfiiib subunits brf and brf are structurally similar to tfiib hence we hypothesize that rna pol iii may be regulated by brca via the tfiib family members brf and brf  here we report that   brca inhibits both vai trna and u snrna rna pol iii transcription   the ad of brca is responsible for inhibition of u snrna transcription whereas the ring domain and ad of brca are required for vai transcription inhibition and   overexpression of brf and brf alleviates inhibition of u snrna and vai transcription by brca  taken together these data suggest that brca is a general repressor of rna pol iii transcription
