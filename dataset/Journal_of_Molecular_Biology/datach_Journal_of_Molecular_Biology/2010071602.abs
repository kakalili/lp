structural evidence for the functional importance of the heme domain mobility in flavocytochrome b
yeast flavocytochrome b  fcb  is an l lactate cytochrome c oxidoreductase in the mitochondrial intermembrane space participating in cellular respiration each enzyme subunit consists of a cytochrome b like heme domain and a flavodehydrogenase fdh domain in the fcb crystal structure the heme domain is mobile relative to the tetrameric fdh core in one out of two subunits the monoclonal antibody b b  elicited against the holoenzyme recognizes only the native heme domain in the holoenzyme when bound it suppresses the intramolecular electron transfer from flavin to heme b  hence cytochrome c reduction we report here the crystal structure of the heme domain in complex with the fab at     resolution the fab epitope on the heme domain includes the two exposed propionate groups of the heme which are hidden in the interface between the domains in the complete subunit the structure discloses an unexpected plasticity of fcb in the neighborhood of the heme cavity in which the heme has rotated the epitope overlaps with the docking area of the fdh domain onto the heme domain indicating that the antibody displaces the heme domain in a movement of large amplitude we suggest that the binding sites on the heme domain of cytochrome c and of the fdh domain also overlap and therefore that cytochrome c binding also requires the heme domain to move away from the fdh domain so as to allow electron transfer between the two hemes based on this hypothesis we propose a possible model of the fcb  cytochrome c complex interestingly this model shares similarity with that of the cytochrome b  cytochrome c complex in which cytochrome c binds to the surface around the exposed heme edge of cytochrome b  the present results therefore support the idea that the heme domain mobility is an inherent component of the fcb functioning
