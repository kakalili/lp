ribosome small subunit dependent gtpase interacts with trna binding sites on the ribosome
rsga ribosome small subunit dependent gtpase a also known as yjeq is a unique gtpase in that guanosine triphosphate hydrolytic activity is activated by the small subunit of the ribosome disruption of the gene for rsga from the genome affects the growth of cells the subunit association of the ribosome and the maturation of  s rrna to study the interaction of escherichia coli rsga with the ribosome chemical modifications using dimethylsulfate and kethoxal were performed on the small subunit in the presence or in the absence of rsga the chemical reactivities at g   a   g   g   g   c   g   g   a   and a   in  s rrna were reduced while those at a   a   g   a   a   and a   were enhanced by the addition of rsga together with   guanylylimidodiphosphate among them the chemical reactivities at a   a   a   g   g   c   g   a   a   a   and a   were not changed when rsga was added together with gdp these results indicate that the binding of rsga induces conformational changes around the a site p site and helix   and that guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis induces partial conformational restoration especially in the head to dissociate rsga from the small subunit rsga has the capacity to coexist with mrna in the ribosome while it promotes dissociation of trna from the ribosome
