multivalent interactions by the set histone methyltransferase with its nucleosome substrate
set is the only mammalian monomethyltransferase responsible for h k me  a methyl mark critical for genomic integrity of eukaryotic cells we present here a structural model for how set uses multivalent interactions to bind and methylate the nucleosome based on crystallographic and solution studies of the set nucleosome complex our studies indicate that set employs its i set and c set domains to engage nucleosomal dna  to   turns from the nucleosomal dyad and in doing so it positions the set domain for catalysis with h lys  surprisingly we find that a basic n terminal extension to the set domain plays an even more prominent role in nucleosome binding possibly by making an arginine anchor interaction with the nucleosome h a h b acidic patch we further show that proliferating cell nuclear antigen and the nucleosome compete for binding to set through this basic extension suggesting a mechanism for how nucleosome binding protects set from proliferating cell nuclear antigen dependent degradation during the cell cycle
