kinetic analysis of the slow skeletal myosin mhc  isoform from bovine masseter muscle
several heavy chain isoforms of class ii myosins are found in muscle fibres and show a large variety of different mechanical activities fast myosins myosin heavy chain mhc ii  contract at higher velocities than slow myosins mhc ii  also known as  myosin and it has been well established that adp binding to actomyosin is much tighter for mhc ii  than for mhc ii  recently we reported several other differences between mhc ii isoforms  and  of the rabbit isoform ii  unlike ii  gave biphasic dissociation of actomyosin by atp the atp cleavage step was significantly slower for mhc ii  and the slow isoforms showed the presence of multiple actomyosin  adp complexes these results are in contrast to published data on mhc ii  from bovine left ventricle muscle which was more similar to the fast skeletal isoform bovine mhc ii  is the predominant isoform expressed in both the ventricular myocardium and slow skeletal muscle fibres such as the masseter and is an important source of reference work for cardiac muscle physiology this work examines and extends the kinetics of bovine mhc ii  we confirm the primary findings from the work on rabbit soleus mhc ii  of significance is that we show that the affinity of adp for bovine masseter myosin in the absence of actin represented by the dissociation constant kd is weaker than originally described for bovine cardiac myosin and thus the thermodynamic coupling between adp and actin binding to myosin is much smaller kad kd   instead of kad kd    this may indicate a distinct type of mechanochemical coupling for this group of myosin motors we also find that the atp hydrolysis rate is much slower for bovine mhc ii    s   than reported previously   s    we discuss how this work fits into a broader characterisation of myosin motors from across the myosin family
