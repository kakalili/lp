synergism between halide binding and proton transport in a clc type exchanger
the cl  h exchange transporter clc ec mediates stoichiometric transmembrane exchange of two cl  ions for one proton a conserved tyrosine residue y   coordinates one of the bound cl  ions visible in the structure of this protein and is located near the intersection of the cl  and h pathways mutants of this tyrosine were scrutinized for effects on the coupled transport of cl  and h determined electrophysiologically and on protein structure determined crystallographically despite the strong conservation of y  in the clc family substitution of f or w at this position preserves wild type transport behavior substitution by a e or h however produces uncoupled proteins with robust cl  transport but greatly impaired movement of h  the obligatory  cl   h stoichiometry is thus lost in these mutants the structures of all the mutants are essentially identical to wild type but apparent anion occupancy in the cl  binding region correlates with functional h coupling in particular as determined by anomalous diffraction in crystals grown in br   an electrophysiologically competent cl  analogue the well coupled transporters show strong br  electron density at the  inner  and  central  cl  binding sites however in the uncoupled mutants br  density is absent at the central site while still present at the inner site an additional mutant y  l is intermediate in both functional and structural features this mutant clearly exchanges h for cl   but at a reduced h to cl  ratio likewise both the central and inner sites are occupied by br   but the central site shows lower br  density than in wild type or in y  f w  the correlation between proton coupling and central site occupancy argues that halide binding to the central transport site somehow facilitates movement of h  a synergism that is not readily understood in terms of alternating site antiport schemes
