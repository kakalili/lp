the structure of the nxf nxt heterodimeric complex reveals the combined specificity and versatility of the ntf like fold
nxf like members of the nxf nuclear export factor family orchestrate bulk nuclear export of mrna while functionally distinct nxf variant proteins carry out separate substrate specific and tissue specific rna regulation metazoan organisms possess at least one nxf like gene and one or more nxf variant genes heterodimerization of both proteins with the nxt ntf related export protein is central to nxf family function however given the multiplicity of nxf nxt complexes the specificity and mechanism of heterodimerization remain unclear here we report the structural and functional analyses of the caenorhabditis elegans nxf variant cenxf bound to cenxt  contacts crucial for nxf nxt heterodimer stability and specificity including a probable site for phosphoregulation have been identified the cenxf ntf domain bears at least two nucleoporin nup binding pockets necessary for the colocalization of cenxf cenxt at the nuclear envelope unexpectedly one nup binding pocket is formed at the heterodimer interface of the cenxf cenxt complex demonstrating that nxt binding directly regulates nxf function
