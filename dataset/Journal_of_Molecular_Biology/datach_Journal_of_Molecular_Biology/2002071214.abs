nucleolin associates with a subset of the human ro ribonucleoprotein complexes
ro rnps are evolutionarily conserved small cytoplasmic rna  protein complexes with an unknown function in human cells ro rnps consist of one of the four hy rnas and two core proteins ro  and la recently the association of hnrnp i and hnrnp k with particles containing hy and hy rnas has been described the association of three other proteins namely calreticulin ro  and robpi with subsets of the ro rnps is still controversial to gain more insight into the composition and function of the ro rnps we have immunopurified these particles from hela cell extracts using monoclonal antibodies against ro  and la using this approach we have identified the rna binding protein nucleolin as a novel subunit of ro rnp particles containing hy or hy rna but not hy and hy rna using an in vitro hy rna binding assay we established that the internal pyrimidine rich loop of hy and hy rna is essential for the association of nucleolin the binding is critically dependent on the presence of all four rnp motifs of nucleolin but not of the c terminal rgg box moreover we demonstrate that in contrast to nucleolin and hnrnp k nucleolin and hnrnp i can bind simultaneously to the internal pyrimidine rich loop of hy rna we postulate that nucleolin functions in the biogenesis and or trafficking of hy and hy rnps through the nucleolus and subsequent transport to the cytoplasm
