interaction of human  phosphoglycerate kinase with its two substrates is substrate antagonism a kinetic advantage
substrate antagonism has been described for a variety of enzymes with more than one substrate and is characterized by a lowering of the affinity of one substrate in the presence of the other s   phosphoglycerate kinase pgk catalyzes phosphotransfer from   bisphosphoglycerate bpg to adp to give  phosphoglycerate pg and atp and is subject to substrate antagonism because of the instability of bpg antagonism has only been described between pg and atp or adp here we show that antagonism also occurs between bpg and adp using the stopped flow method we show that the dissociation constant for one substrate increases in the presence of the other and that this decrease in affinity is mainly due to an increase in the dissociation rate constant as a consequence there is an increase in the overall interaction kinetics interestingly in the presence of the mirror image of natural d adp l adp a good substrate for pgk  antagonism is absent using rapid quench flow we studied the kinetics of atp formation the time courses present the following   a lag with l adp but not with d adp the kinetics of which were similar to the interaction kinetics measured by stopped flow   a burst that is directed by the phosphotransfer and   a steady state that is rate limited by the release of product kinetics structural explanations for these results are proposed by analyzing the crystallographic structure of the fully closed conformation of pgk in complex with l adp pg and the transition state analogue alf   compared to previously determined structures
