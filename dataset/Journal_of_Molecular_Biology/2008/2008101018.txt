In Eukarya and Archaea, translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2/aIF2), which contains three subunits (α, β, and γ), is pivotal for binding of charged initiator tRNA to the small ribosomal subunit. The crystal structure of the full-sized heterotrimeric aIF2 from Sulfolobus solfataricus in the nucleotide-free form has been determined at 2.8-Å resolution. Superposition of four molecules in the asymmetric unit of the crystal and the comparison of the obtained structures with the known structures of the aIF2αγ and aIF2βγ heterodimers revealed high conformational flexibility in the α- and β-subunits. In fact, the full-sized aIF2 consists of a rigid central part, formed by the γ-subunit, domain 3 of the α-subunit, and the N-terminal α-helix of the β-subunit, and two mobile “wings,” formed by domains 1 and 2 of the α-subunit, the central part, and the zinc-binding domain of the β-subunit. High structural flexibility of the wings is probably required for interaction of aIF2 with the small ribosomal subunit. Comparative analysis of all known structures of the γ-subunit alone and within the heterodimers and heterotrimers in nucleotide-bound and nucleotide-free states shows that the conformations of switch 1 and switch 2 do not correlate with the assembly or nucleotide states of the protein.
