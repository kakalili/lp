molecular requirements for duplex recognition and cleavage by eukaryotic rnase iii discovery of an rna dependent dna cleavage activity of yeast rnt p
members of the double stranded rna dsrna specific rnase iii family are known to use a conserved dsrna binding domain dsrbd to distinguish rna a form helices from dna b form ones however the basis of this selectivity and its effect on cleavage specificity remain unknown here we directly examine the molecular requirements for dsrna recognition and cleavage by the budding yeast rnase iii rnt p  and compare it to both bacterial rnase iii and fission yeast rnase iii pac  we synthesized substrates with either chemically modified nucleotides near the cleavage sites or with different dna rna combinations and investigated their binding and cleavage by rnt p substitution for the ribonucleotide vicinal to the scissile phosphodiester linkage with   deoxy   fluoro  d ribose    f rna  a deoxyribonucleotide or a   o methylribonucleotide permitted cleavage by rnt p while the introduction of a      phosphodiester linkage permitted binding but not cleavage this indicates that the position of the phosphodiester link with respect to the nuclease domain and not the   oh group is critical for cleavage by rnt p surprisingly rnt p bound to a dna helix capped with an ngnn tetraribonucleotide loop indicating that the binding of at least one member of the rnase iii family is not restricted to rna the results also suggest that the dsrbd may accommodate b form dna duplexes interestingly rnt p but not pac nor bacterial rnase iii cleaved the dna strand of a dna rna hybrid indicating that a form rna helix is not essential for cleavage by rnt p in contrast rna dna hybrids bound to but were not cleaved by rnt p underscoring the critical role for the nucleotide located at   end of the tetraloop and suggesting an asymmetrical mode of substrate recognition in cell extracts the native enzyme effectively cleaved the dna rna hybrid indicating much broader rnt p substrate specificity than previously thought the discovery of this novel rna dependent deoxyribonuclease activity has potential implications in devising new antiviral strategies that target actively transcribed dna
