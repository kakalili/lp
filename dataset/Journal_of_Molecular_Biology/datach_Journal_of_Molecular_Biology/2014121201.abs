evidence for new homotypic and heterotypic interactions between transmembrane helices of proteins involved in receptor tyrosine kinase and neuropilin signaling
signaling in eukaryotic cells frequently relies on dynamic interactions of single pass membrane receptors involving their transmembrane tm domains to search for new such interactions we have developed a bacterial two hybrid system to screen for both homotypic and heterotypic interactions between tm helices we have explored the dimerization of tm domains from  proteins involved in both receptor tyrosine kinase and neuropilin signaling this study has revealed several new interactions we found that the tm domain of mucin  a putative intramembrane ligand for erbb  dimerizes not only with erbb but also with all four members of the erbb family in the neuropilin plexin family of receptors we showed that the tm domains of neuropilins  and  dimerize with themselves and also with plexin a  plexin b  and l cam but we were unable to observe interactions with several other tm domains notably those of members of the vegf receptor family the potentially important neuropilin  plexin a interaction was confirmed using a surface plasmon resonance assay this work shows that tm domain interactions can be highly specific exploring further the propensities of tm helix  helix association in cell membrane should have important practical implications related to our understanding of the structure  function of bitopic proteins assembly and subsequent function especially in the regulation of signal transduction
