labeling and localization of the herpes simplex virus capsid protein ul  and its interaction with the two triplexes closest to the penton
the herpes simplex virus type  ul  protein is one of seven viral proteins that are required for dna cleavage and packaging together with ul  ul  forms part of an elongated molecule referred to as the c capsid specific component ccsc  five copies of the ccsc are located at each of the capsid vertices on dna containing capsids to study the conformation of ul  as it is folded on the capsid surface we identified the sequence recognized by a ul  specific monoclonal antibody and localized the epitope on the capsid surface by immunogold electron microscopy the epitope mapped to amino acids     adjacent to the region of the protein amino acids     that is required for capsid binding in addition cryo em reconstructions of c capsids in which the green fluorescent protein gfp was fused within the n terminus of ul  localized the point of contact between ul  and gfp the result confirmed the modeled location of the ul  protein in the ccsc density as the region that is distal to the penton with the n terminus of ul  making contact with the triplex one removed from the penton immunofluorescence experiments at early times during infection demonstrated that ul   gfp was present on capsids located within the cytoplasm and adjacent to the nucleus these results support the view that ul  is present on incoming capsids with the capsid binding domain of ul  located on the surface of the mature dna containing capsid
