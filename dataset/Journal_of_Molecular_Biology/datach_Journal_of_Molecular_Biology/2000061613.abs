the g c rich discriminator region of the tyrt promoter antagonises the formation of stable preinitiation complexes edited by m yaniv
rna polymerase forms a highly stable preinitiation complex at many prokaryotic promoters in the absence of ribonucleotides these are often characterised by the longevity of the dna strand separated open complex in the presence of heparin in contrast such complexes are notoriously unstable at the promoters for rrna and trna under similar conditions the high g c content within the dna melting region of these promoters has been implicated in this seemingly anomalous behaviour here we used rapid pulse uv laser photo footprinting to monitor the transient structural intermediates formed at the escherichia coli tyr t promoter promoter derivatives with a t for g c base substitutions within the g c rich discriminator region    to    augmented the stability of complexes on both linear fragments and supercoiled plasmid dna analysis of the lifetime of the preinitiation complexes as a function of the discriminator sequence reveals a direct relationship between the a t content of the dna melting region and the stability of the ensuing complex our results are consistent with the premise that a g c block to dna untwisting and or dna melting operates to prevent the formation of the stable isomers that are implicated in most other transcription initiation pathways
