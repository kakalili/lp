characterization of a double dockerin from the cellulosome of the anaerobic fungus piromyces equi
the assembly into supramolecular complexes of proteins having complementary activities is central to cellular function one such complex of considerable biological and industrial significance is the plant cell wall degrading apparatus of anaerobic microorganisms termed the cellulosome a central feature of bacterial cellulosomes is a large non catalytic protein the scaffoldin which contains multiple cohesin domains an array of digestive enzymes is incorporated into the cellulosome through the interaction of the dockerin domains present in the catalytic subunits with the cohesin domains that are present in the scaffoldin by contrast in anaerobic fungi such as piromyces equi the dockerins of cellulosomal enzymes are often present in tandem copies however the identity of the cognate cohesin domains in these organisms is unclear hindering further biotechnological development of the fungal cellulosome here we characterise the solution structure and function of a double dockerin construct from the p equi endoglucanase cel a we show that the two domains are connected by a flexible linker that is short enough to keep the binding sites of the two domains on adjacent surfaces and allows the double dockerin construct to bind more tightly to cellulosomes than a single domain and with greater coverage the double dockerin binds to the gh   glucosidase component of the fungal cellulosome which is thereby identified as a potential scaffoldin
