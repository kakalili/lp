four human thiopurine s methyltransferase alleles severely affect protein structure and dynamics
thiopurine s methyltransferase tpmt metabolizes cytotoxic thiopurine drugs used in the treatment of leukemia and inflammatory bowel disease tpmt is a major pharmacogenomic target with  alleles identified to date several of these alleles cause rapid protein degradation and or aggregation making it extremely difficult to study the structural impact of the tpmt polymorphisms experimentally we therefore have performed multiple molecular dynamics simulations of the four most common alleles tpmt  a p   a a  t y  c   b a  t and  c y  c  to investigate the molecular mechanism of tpmt inactivation at an atomic level the a p polymorphism in tpmt  disrupts helix   bordering the active site which breaks several salt bridge interactions and opens up a large cleft in the protein the a  t polymorphism is located within the co substrate binding site the larger threonine alters the packing of substrate binding residues p  l  y   increasing the solvent exposure of the polymorphic site this packing rearrangement may account for the complete lack of activity in the a  t mutant the y  c polymorphism is located in  strand  distant from the active site side chain contacts between residue   and helix   are lost in tpmt c residues   and   in tpmt a are connected through a hydrogen bonding network the dual polymorphisms result in a flattened slightly distorted protein structure and an increase in the thiopurine binding site solvent accessibility the two variants that undergo the most rapid degradation in vivo tpmt  and  a are also the most deformed in the simulations
