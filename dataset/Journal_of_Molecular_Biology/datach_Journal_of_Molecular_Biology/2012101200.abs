propeptides are sufficient to regulate organelle specific ph dependent activation of furin and proprotein convertase
the proprotein convertases pcs furin and proprotein convertase   pc  cleave substrates at dibasic residues along the eukaryotic secretory endocytic pathway pcs are evolutionarily related to bacterial subtilisin and are synthesized as zymogens they contain n terminal propeptides pro that function as dedicated catalysts that facilitate folding and regulate activation of cognate proteases through multiple ordered cleavages previous studies identified a histidine residue his  that functions as a ph sensor in the propeptide of furin profur  which regulates furin activation at ph   within the trans  golgi network although this residue is conserved in the pc propeptide propc  pc nonetheless activates at ph   within the dense core secretory granules here we analyze the mechanism by which profur regulates furin activation and examine why profur and propc differ in their ph dependent activation sequence analyses establish that while both profur and propc are enriched in histidines when compared with cognate catalytic domains and prokaryotic orthologs histidine content in profur is  fold greater than that in propc  which may augment its ph sensitivity spectroscopy and molecular dynamics establish that histidine protonation significantly unfolds profur when compared to propc to enhance autoproteolysis we further demonstrate that profur and propc are sufficient to confer organelle sensing on folding and activation of their cognate proteases swapping propeptides between furin and pc transfers ph dependent protease activation in a propeptide dictated manner in vitro and in cells since prokaryotes lack organelles and eukaryotic pcs evolved from propeptide dependent not propeptide independent prokaryotic subtilases our results suggest that histidine enrichment may have enabled propeptides to evolve to exploit ph gradients to activate within specific organelles
