mapping the active sites of bacterial translation initiation factor if
if c is the c terminal domain of escherichia coli translation initiation factor  if  and is responsible for all functions of this translation initiation factor but for its ribosomal recycling to map the number and nature of the active sites of if and to identify the essential arg residue s chemically modified with   butanedione the eight arginine residues of if c were substituted by lys his ser and leu generating  variants that were tested in vitro for all known if activities the if   s subunit interaction was inhibited strongly by substitutions of arg  arg   arg   arg  and arg   the positive charges being important at positions   and   the  s ribosome dissociation was affected by mutations of arg   arg  and to a lesser extent of arg  and arg   pseudo initiation complex dissociation was impaired by substitution of arg  and arg   whose positive charges are important and to a lesser extent of arg   arg   arg  and arg   while the dissociation of non canonical  s initiation complexes was preserved at wild type levels in all  mutants stimulation of mrna translation was reduced by mutations of arg   arg  and to a lesser extent of arg  arg  and arg  whereas inhibition of non canonical mrna translation was affected by substitutions of arg  arg   arg  and to a lesser extent arg   arg  and arg   finally repositioning the mrna on the  s subunit was affected weakly by mutations of arg   arg   arg   arg  and arg   overall the results define two active surfaces in if c and indicate that the different functions of if rely on different molecular mechanisms involving separate active sites
