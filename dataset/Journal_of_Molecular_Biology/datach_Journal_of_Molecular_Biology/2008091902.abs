the presence of a c   g  pair in a trna precursor influences processing and expression in vivo
to understand whether   and   structural elements of the region corresponding to the mature trna affect the expression of the trna we examined several bacterial genomes for trna genes where the expression might be potentially affected by structural elements located outside of the mature trna in pseudomonas aeruginosa our analysis suggested that the trnatrp is transcribed together with a putative stem  loop structure followed by a uridine tract immediately downstream of the trna region this structural element resembling a rho independent transcription terminator might therefore influence the expression and processing of trnatrp moreover the secondary structure suggested that the discriminator base in the trnatrp precursor can pair with either the c at position    the   terminal residue in the   leader or the c immediately   of the uridine tract of the putative rho independent transcription terminator here we present in vivo data demonstrating the importance of residue   and the positioning of the putative transcription terminator for the expression of correctly   processed p aeruginosa trnatrp in escherichia coli interestingly we also detected a difference in the appearance of correctly   processed p aeruginosa trnatrp in e coli compared to the situation in p aeruginosa
