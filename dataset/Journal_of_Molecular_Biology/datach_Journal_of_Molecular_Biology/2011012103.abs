probing water accessibility in het s      amyloid fibrils by solid state nmr
despite the importance of protein fibrils in the context of conformational diseases information on their structure is still sparse hydrogen deuterium exchange measurements of backbone amide protons allow the identification hydrogen bonding patterns and reveal pertinent information on the amyloid  sheet architecture however they provide only little information on the identity of residues exposed to solvent or buried inside the fibril core nmr spectroscopy is a potent method for identifying solvent accessible residues in proteins via observation of polarization transfer between chemically exchanging side chain protons and water protons we show here that the combined use of highly deuterated samples and fast magic angle spinning greatly attenuates unwanted spin diffusion and allows identification of polarization exchange with the solvent in a site specific manner we apply this measurement protocol to het s      prion fibrils under different conditions including physiological ph where protofibrils assemble together into thicker fibrils and demonstrate that each protofibril of het s       is surrounded by water thus excluding the existence of extended dry interfibril contacts we also show that exchangeable side chain protons inside the hydrophobic core of het s      do not exchange over time intervals of weeks to months the experiments proposed in this study can provide insight into the detailed structural features of amyloid fibrils in general
