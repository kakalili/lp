targeting of adenovirus serotype  pseudotyped with short fiber from serotype  to c erbb positive cells using bispecific single chain diabody
the purpose of the current study was to alter the broad native tropism of human adenovirus for virus targeting to c erbb positive cancer cells first we engineered a single chain antibody scfv against the c erbb oncoprotein into minor capsid protein ix pix of adenovirus serotype  ad  in a manner commensurate with virion integrity and binding to the soluble extracellular c erbb domain to ablate native viral tropism and facilitate binding of the pix incorporated scfv to cellular c erbb  we replaced the ad fiber with the ad  short  s fiber devoid of all known cell binding determinants the resultant ad f six  vector demonstrated increased cell binding and gene transfer as compared to the ad f s control however this augmentation of virus infectivity was not c erbb specific incorporation of a six histidine his  peptide into the c terminus of the  s fiber protein resulted in markedly increased ad f s h infectivity in  ar cells which express a membrane anchored scfv against the c terminal oligohistidine tag as compared to the ad f s vector and the parental   cells these data suggested that a  s fiber incorporated his tag could serve for attachment of an adapter protein designed to guide ad f s h infection in a c erbb specific manner we therefore engineered a bispecific scfv diabody scdb combining affinities for both c erbb and the his tag and showed its ability to provide up to  fold increase of ad f s h infectivity in c erbb positive cells thus ad fiber replacement by a his tagged  s fiber coupled with virus targeting mediated by an scdb adapter represents a promising strategy to confer ad vector tropism for c erbb positive cancer cells
