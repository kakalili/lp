characterization of the atpase activity of the escherichia coli recg protein reveals that the preferred cofactor is negatively supercoiled dna
recg is a member of the superfamily  helicase family its possible role in vivo is atp hydrolysis driven regression of stalled replication forks to gain mechanistic insight into how this is achieved a coupled spectrophotometric assay was utilized to characterize the atpase activity of recg in vitro the results demonstrate an overwhelming preference for negatively supercoiled dna    scdna as a cofactor for the hydrolysis of atp in the presence of   scdna the catalytic efficiency of recg and the processivity as revealed through heparin trapping  were higher than on any other cofactor examined the activity of recg on   scdna was not due to the presence of single stranded regions functioning as loading sites for the enzyme as relaxed circular dna treated with dna gyrase resulted in the highest levels of atpase activity relaxation of   scdna by a topoisomerase resulted in a  fold decrease in atpase activity comparable to that observed on both linear double stranded ds dna and  scdna in addition to the elevated activity in the presence of   scdna recg also has high activity on model y substrates i e chicken foot structures  this is due largely to the high apparent affinity of the enzyme for this dna substrate which is  fold higher than a y substrate i e a three way with two single stranded ss dna arms  finally the enzyme exhibited significant but lower activity on ssdna this activity was enhanced by the escherichia coli stranded dna binding protein ssb protein which occurs through stabilizing of the binding of recg to ssdna stabilization is not afforded by the bacteriophage gene  protein indicating a species specific protein  protein interaction is involved these results combine to provide significant insight into the manner and timing of the interaction of recg with dna at stalled replication forks
