combination of the human prolyl isomerase fkbp  with unrelated chaperone domains leads to chimeric folding enzymes with high activity
folding enzymes often use distinct domains for the binding of substrate proteins   chaperone domains   and for the catalysis of slow folding reactions such as disulfide formation or prolyl isomerization the human prolyl isomerase fkbp  is a small single domain protein without a chaperone domain its very low folding activity could previously be increased by inserting the chaperone domain from the homolog slyd sensitive to lysis protein d of escherichia coli we now inserted three unrelated chaperone domains into human fkbp  the apical domain of the chaperonin groel from e coli the chaperone domain of protein disulfide isomerase from yeast or the chaperone domain of sura from the periplasm of e coli all three conveyed fkbp  with a high affinity for unfolded proteins and increased its folding activity substrate binding and release of the chimeric folding enzymes were found to be very fast this allows rapid substrate transfer from the chaperone domain to the catalytic domain and ensures efficient rebinding of protein chains that were unable to complete folding the advantage of having separate sites first for generic protein binding and then for specific catalysis explains why our construction of the artificial folding enzymes with foreign chaperone domains was successful
