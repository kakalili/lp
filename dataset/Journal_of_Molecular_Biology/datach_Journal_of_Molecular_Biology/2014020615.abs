the oligomeric state of the active vps aaa atpase
the cellular escrt endosomal sorting complexes required for transport pathway drives membrane constriction toward the cytosol and effects membrane fission during cytokinesis endosomal sorting and the release of many enveloped viruses including the human immunodeficiency virus a component of this pathway the aaa atpase vps  provides energy for pathway progression although it is established that vps functions as an oligomer subunit stoichiometry and other fundamental features of the functional enzyme are unclear here we report that although some mutant vps proteins form dodecameric assemblies active wild type saccharomyces cerevisiae and sulfolobus solfataricus vps enzymes can form hexamers in the presence of atp and adp as assayed by size exclusion chromatography and equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation the vta p activator binds hexameric yeast vps p without changing the oligomeric state of vps p implying that the active vta p  vps p complex also contains a single hexameric ring additionally we report crystal structures of two different archaeal vps homologs whose structures and lattice interactions suggest a conserved mode of oligomerization disruption of the proposed hexamerization interface by mutagenesis abolished the atpase activity of archaeal vps proteins and blocked vps p function in s cerevisiae these data challenge the prevailing model that active vps is a double ring dodecamer and argue that like other type i aaa atpases vps functions as a single ring with six subunits
