using evolutionary information and ancestral sequences to understand the sequence  function relationship in glp  agonists
glucagon like peptide  glp  is an incretin hormone with therapeutic potential for type  diabetes a variety of glp  sequences are known from amphibian species and some of these have been tested here and found to be able to bind and activate the human glp  receptor while little difference was observed for the in vitro potency for the human glp  receptor larger differences were found in the enzymatic stability of these peptides two peptides showed increased enzymatic stability and they group together phylogenetically though they originate from amphibia and reptilia we have used ancestral sequence reconstruction to analyze the evolution of these glp  molecules including the synthesis of new peptides we find that the increased stability could not be observed in the resurrected peptides from the common ancestor of frogs even though they maintain the ability to activate the human glp  receptor another method using residue mapping on evolutionary branches yielded peptides that had maintained potency towards the receptor and also showed increased stability this represents a new approach using evolutionary data in protein engineering
