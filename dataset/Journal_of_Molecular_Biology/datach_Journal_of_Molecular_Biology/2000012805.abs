pyd encodes   dihydropyrimidine amidohydrolase which participates in a novel fungal catabolic pathway edited by j karn
most fungi cannot use pyrimidines or their degradation products as the sole nitrogen source previously we screened several yeasts for their ability to catabolise pyrimidines one of them saccharomyces kluyveri was able to degrade the majority of pyrimidines here a series of molecular techniques have been modified to clone pyrimidine catabolic genes study their expression and purify the corresponding enzymes from this yeast the pyd   mutant which lacked the   dihydropyrimidine amidohydrolase dhpase activity was transformed with wild type s kluyveri genomic library the complementing plasmid contained the full sequence of the pyd gene which exhibited a high level of homology with mammalian dhpases and bacterial hydantoinases the organisation of pyd showed a couple of specific features the   codons open reading frame was interrupted by a  bp intron which does not contain the saccharomyces cerevisiae branch point sequence and the transcripts contained a long   untranslated leader with five or six aug codons the derived amino acid sequence showed similarities with dihydroorotases allantoinases and uricases from various organisms surprisingly the ura gene from s cerevisiae which encodes dihydroorotase shows greater similarity to pyd and other catabolic enzymes than to dihydroorotases from several other non fungal organisms the s kluyveri dhpase was purified to homogeneity and sequencing of the n terminal region revealed that the purified enzyme corresponds to the pyd gene product the enzyme is a tetramer likely consisting of similar if not identical subunits each with a molecular mass of  kda the s kluyveri dhpase was capable of catalysing both dihydrouracil and dihydrothymine degradation presumably by the same reaction mechanism as that described for mammalian dhpase on the other hand the regulation of the yeast pyd gene and dhpase seem to be different from that in other organisms dhpase activity and northern analysis demonstrated that pyd expression is inducible by dihydrouracil though not by uracil apparently dihydrouracil and dhpase represent an important regulatory checkpoint of the pyrimidine catabolic pathway in s kluyveri
