the crystal structure of cd in complex with yts    fab and interaction with other cd antibodies define the binding mode of cd    to mhc class i
the cd   heterodimer interacts with class i pmhc on antigen presenting cells as a co receptor for tcr mediated activation of cytotoxic t cells to characterize this immunologically important interaction we used monoclonal antibodies mabs specific to either cd  or cd  to probe the mechanism of cd   binding to pmhci the yts    mab inhibits this interaction and blocks t cell activation to elucidate the molecular basis for this inhibition the crystal structure of the cd   immunoglobulin like ectodomains were determined in complex with mab yts   fab at     resolution the yts   epitope on cd  was identified and implies that residues in the cdr and cdr equivalent loops of cd  are occluded upon binding to class i pmhc to further characterize the pmhci cd   interaction binding of class i tetramers to cd   on the surface of t cells was assessed in the presence of anti cd  mabs in contrast to yts    mab yts    which is specific for cd   does not inhibit binding of cd   to class i tetramers indicating the yts    epitope is not occluded in the pmhci cd   complex together these data indicate a model for the pmhci cd   interaction similar to that observed for cd   in the cd   pmhci complex but in which cd  occupies the lower orientation membrane proximal to the antigen presenting cell  and cd  occupies the upper position membrane distal  the implication of this molecular assembly for the function of cd   in t cell activation is discussed
