inter helical hydrogen bond formation during membrane protein integration into the er membrane
recent work has shown that efficient di or trimerization of hydrophobic transmembrane helices in detergent micelles or lipid bilayers can be driven by inter helix hydrogen bonding involving polar residues such as asn or asp using in vitro translation in the presence of rough microsomes of a model integral membrane protein we now show that the formation of so called helical hairpins two tightly spaced transmembrane helices connected by a short loop can likewise be promoted by the introduction of asn asn or asp asp pairs in a long transmembrane hydrophobic segment these observations suggest that inter helix hydrogen bonds can form within the context of the sec  translocon in the endoplasmic reticulum implying that hydrophobic segments in a nascent polypeptide chain in transit through the sec  channel have immediate access to a non aqueous subcompartment within the translocon
