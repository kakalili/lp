the structures of escherichia coli inorganic pyrophosphatase complexed with ca  or cappi at atomic resolution and their mechanistic implications edited by r huber
two structures of escherichia coli soluble inorganic pyrophosphatase eppase complexed with calcium pyrophosphate cappi eppase and with ca  ca  eppase have been solved at   and    resolution respectively in the presence of mg  this enzyme cleaves pyrophosphate ppi into two molecules of orthophosphate pi  this work has enabled us to locate ppi in the active site of the inorganic pyrophosphatases family in the presence of ca  which is an inhibitor of eppase upon ppi binding two ca  at m and m subsites move closer together and one of the liganded water molecules becomes bridging the mutual location of ppi and the bridging water molecule in the presence of inhibitor cation is catalytically incompetent to make a favourable ppi attack by this water molecule modelling of a possible hydrolysable conformation of ppi in the cappi eppase active site has been performed the reasons for ca  being the strong ppase inhibitor and the role in catalysis of each of four metal ions are the mechanistic aspects discussed on the basis of the structures described
