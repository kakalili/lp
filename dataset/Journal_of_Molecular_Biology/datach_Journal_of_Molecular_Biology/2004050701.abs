crystal structure of bstyi at    resolution a thermophilic restriction endonuclease with overlapping specificities to bamhi and bglii
we report here the structure of bstyi an  intermediate  type ii restriction endonuclease with overlapping sequence specificities to bamhi and bglii bstyi a thermophilic endonuclease recognizes and cleaves the degenerate hexanucleotide sequence   rgatcy    where r a or g and y c or t  cleaving dna after the   r on each strand to produce four base    staggered ends the crystal structure of free bstyi was solved at    resolution by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion mad phasing comparison with bamhi and bglii reveals a strong structural consensus between all three enzymes mapping to the    core domain and residues involved in catalysis unexpectedly bstyi also contains an additional  arm  substructure outside of the core protein which enables the enzyme to adopt a more compact intertwined dimer structure compared with bamhi and bglii this arm substructure may underlie the thermostability of bstyi we identify putative dna recognition residues and speculate as to how this enzyme achieves a  relaxed  dna specificity
