amyloid protofilaments from the calcium binding protein equine lysozyme formation of ring and linear structures depends on ph and metal ion concentration
the calcium binding equine lysozyme has been found to undergo conversion into amyloid fibrils during incubation in solution at acidic ph at ph   and   c where equine lysozyme forms a partially unfolded molten globule state the protein forms protofilaments with a width of ca  nm in the absence of ca  the protofilaments are present as annular structures with a diameter of     nm in the presence of  mm cacl the protofilaments of equine lysozyme are straight or curved they can assemble into thicker threads but they do not appear to undergo circularisation at ph   where the protein is more destabilised compared to ph   fibril formation occurs at   c and   c at ph   both ring shaped and linear protofilaments are formed in which periodic repeats of ca  nm can be distinguished clearly the rings constitute about   of all fibrillar species under these conditions and they are characterised by a larger diameter of     nm all the structures bind congo red and thioflavine t in a manner similar to fibrils associated with a variety of amyloid diseases at ph   fibril formation is accompanied by some acidic hydrolysis producing specific fragmentation of the protein leading to the accumulation of two peptides in particular consisting of residues    and      at the initial stages of incubation however full length equine lysozyme represents the dominant species within the fibrils we propose that the ring shaped structures observed here and in the case of disease associated proteins such as  synuclein could be a second generic type of amyloid structure in addition to the more common linear fibrils
