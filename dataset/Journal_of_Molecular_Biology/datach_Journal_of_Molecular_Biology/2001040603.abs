the prion protein has dna strand transfer properties similar to retroviral nucleocapsid protein edited by j karn
the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are fatal neurodegenerative diseases that are associated with the accumulation of a protease resistant form of the cellular prion protein prp  although prp is highly conserved and widely expressed in vertebrates its function remains a matter of speculation indeed prp null mice develop normally and are healthy recent results show that prp binds to nucleic acids in vitro and is found associated with retroviral particles furthermore in mice the scrapie infectious process appears to be accelerated by mulv replication these observations prompted us to further investigate the interaction between prp and nucleic acids and compare it with that of the retroviral nucleocapsid protein nc  as the major nucleic acid binding protein of the retroviral particle nc protein is tightly associated with the genomic rna in the virion nucleocapsid where it chaperones proviral dna synthesis by reverse transcriptase our results show that the human prion protein huprp functionally resembles ncp of hiv  both proteins form large nucleoprotein complexes upon binding to dna they accelerate the hybridization of complementary dna strands and chaperone viral dna synthesis during the minus and plus dna strand tranfers necessary to generate the long terminal repeats the dna binding and strand transfer properties of huprp appear to map to the n terminal fragment comprising residues  to   whereas the c terminal domain is inactive these findings suggest that prp could be involved in nucleic acid metabolism in vivo
