beyond dimerization a membrane dependent activation model for interleukin  receptor mediated signalling
class i cytokine receptors efficiently transfer activation signals from the extracellular space to the cytoplasm and play a dominant role in growth control and differentiation of human tissues although a significant body of literature is devoted to this topic a consistent mechanistic picture for receptor activation in the membrane environment is still missing using the interleukin  receptor il r as an example we propose that the membrane proximal stem  loop of the extracellular domains contains pivotal elements of a rotational switch interfacial energies of amino acid side chains contained in the highly conserved wsxws at the surface of the lipid bilayer suggest a new functional role for this motif a generic activation mechanism for this receptor class is presented which may impact the design of a new generation of biophysical assay systems
