m  procoat protein insertion into yidc and secyeg proteoliposomes and liposomes
m  procoat protein was one of the first model proteins used to study bacterial membrane protein insertion it contains a signal peptide of  amino acid residues and is not membrane targeted by the signal recognition particle the translocation of its periplasmic domain is independent of the preprotein translocase secayeg but requires electrochemical membrane potential and the membrane insertase yidc of escherichia coli we show here that yidc is sufficient for efficient membrane insertion of the purified m  procoat protein into energized yidc proteoliposomes when no membrane potential is applied the insertion is substantially reduced only in the presence of yidc membrane insertion occurs if bilayer integrity is preserved and membrane potential is stable for more than   min a mutant of the m  procoat protein h ee with two additional negatively charged residues in the periplasmic domain inserted into yidc proteoliposomes and secyeg proteoliposomes with equal efficiencies we conclude that the protein can use both the yidc only pathway and the sec pathway this poses the questions of how procoat h ee is inserted in vivo and how insertion pathways are selected in the cell
