crystal structure of the transcriptional regulator acrr from escherichia coli
the acrab multidrug efflux pump which belongs to the resistance nodulation division rnd family recognizes and extrudes a wide range of antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents and causes the intrinsic antibiotic resistance in escherichia coli the expression of acrab is controlled by the transcriptional regulator acrr whose open reading frame is located   bp upstream of the acrab operon to understand the structural basis of acrr regulation we have determined the crystal structure of acrr to     resolution revealing a dimeric two domain molecule with an entirely helical architecture similar to members of the tetr family of transcriptional regulators each monomer of acrr forms a multientrance pocket of     in the ligand binding domain the ligand binding pocket is surrounded with mostly hydrophobic residues in addition a completely buried negatively charged glutamate expected to be critical for drug binding is located at the center of the binding pocket the crystal structure provides novel insight into the mechanisms of ligand binding and acrr regulation
