alternative conformations at the rna binding surface of the n terminal u af  rna recognition motif
the essential pre mrna splicing factor u auxiliary factor  kd u af  recognizes the polypyrimidine tract py tract consensus sequence of the pre mrna using two rna recognition motifs rrms  the most prevalent class of eukaryotic rna binding domain the py tracts of higher eukaryotic pre mrnas are often interrupted with purines yet u af  must identify these degenerate py tracts for accurate pre mrna splicing previously the structure of a u af  variant in complex with poly u rna suggested that rearrangement of flexible side chains or bound water molecules may contribute to degenerate py tract recognition by u af  here the x ray structure of the n terminal rrm domain of u af  rrm  is described at     resolution in the absence of rna notably rna binding by u af  selectively stabilizes pre existing alternative conformations of three side chains located at the rna interface arg   lys   and arg   additionally a flexible loop connecting the     strands undergoes a conformational change to interact with the rna these pre existing alternative conformations may contribute to the ability of u af  to recognize a variety of py tract sequences this rare high resolution view of an important member of the rrm class of rna binding domains highlights the role of alternative side chain conformations in rna recognition
