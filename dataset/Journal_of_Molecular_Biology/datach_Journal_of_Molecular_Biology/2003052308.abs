crystal structure of the avilamycin resistance conferring methyltransferase avira from streptomyces viridochromogenes
the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacterial strains is a widespread problem in contemporary medical practice and drug design it is therefore important to elucidate the underlying mechanism in each case the methyltransferase avira from streptomyces viridochromogenes mediates resistance to the antibiotic avilamycin which is closely related to evernimicin an oligosaccharide antibiotic that has been used in medical studies the structure of avira was determined by x ray diffraction at    resolution phases were obtained from one selenomethionine residue introduced by site directed mutagenesis the chain fold is similar to that of most methyltransferases although avira contains two additional helices as a specific feature a putative binding site for the cofactor s adenosyl l methionine was derived from homologous structures it agrees with the conserved pattern of interacting amino acid residues avira methylates a specific guanine base within the peptidyltransferase loop of the  s ribosomal rna guided by the target the enzyme was docked to the cognate ribosomal surface where it fit well into a deep cleft without contacting any ribosomal protein the two additional  helices of avira filled a depression in the surface since the transferred methyl group of the cofactor is in a pocket beneath the enzyme surface the targeted guanine base has to flip out for methylation
