a fluid salt bridging cluster and the stabilization of p
p  is a homotetrameric tumor suppressor protein that is found to be mutated in most human cancers some of these mutations particularly mutations to r   fall in the tetramerization domain and cause defects in tetramer formation leading to loss of function mutation to his at this site has been found to destabilize the tetramer in a ph dependent fashion in structures of the tetramerization domain determined by crystallography r  from one monomer makes a salt bridge with d  from another monomer apparently helping to stabilize the tetramer here we present molecular dynamics simulations of wild type p  and the r  his mutant at several different ph and salt conditions we find that the      salt bridge is joined by two other charged side chains r  and e   these four residues do not settle into a fixed pattern of salt bridging but continue to exchange salt bridging partners on the nanosecond time scale throughout the simulation this unusual system of fluid salt bridging may explain the previous finding from alanine scanning experiments that r  contributes significantly to protein stability even though in the crystal structure it is extended outward into solvent this extended conformation of r  appears to be the result of a specific crystal contact and this contact being absent in the simulation r  turns inward to join its interaction partners when r  is mutated to his but remains positively charged it maintains the original interaction with d   but the newly observed interaction with e  is weakened accounting for the reduced stability of r  h even under mildly acidic conditions when this his is deprotonated the interaction with d  is also lost accounting for the further destabilization observed under mildly alkaline conditions simulations were carried out using both explicit and implicit solvent models and both displayed similar behavior of the fluid salt bridging cluster suggesting that implicit solvent models can capture at least the qualitative features of this phenomenon as well as explicit solvent simulations under strongly acidic conditions in implicit solvent displayed the beginnings of the unfolding process a destabilization of the hydrophobic dimer  dimer interface computational alanine scanning using the molecular mechanics poisson  boltzmann surface area method showed significant correlation to experimental unfolding data for charged and polar residues but much weaker correlation for hydrophobic residues
