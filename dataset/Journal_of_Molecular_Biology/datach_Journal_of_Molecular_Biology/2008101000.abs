selective cu  binding redox silencing and cytoprotective effects of the small heat shock proteins  a and  b crystallin
oxidative stress and cu  have been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases and in cataract oxidative stress as well as cu  is also known to induce the expression of the small heat shock proteins  crystallins however the role of  crystallins in oxidative stress and in cu  mediated processes is not clearly understood we demonstrate using fluorescence and isothermal titration calorimetry that  crystallins  a and  b crystallin and its phosphorylation mimic  d b crystallin bind cu  with close to picomolar range affinity the presence of other tested divalent cations such as zn  mg  and ca  does not affect cu  binding indicating selectivity of the cu  binding site s in  crystallins cu  binding induces structural changes and increase in the hydrodynamic radii of  crystallins cu  binding increases the stability of  crystallins towards guanidinium chloride induced unfolding chaperone activity of  a crystallin increases significantly upon cu  binding   crystallins rescue amyloid beta peptide a     from cu  induced aggregation in vitro   crystallins inhibit cu  induced oxidation of ascorbate and hence prevent the generation of reactive oxygen species interestingly   synuclein a cu  binding protein does not inhibit this oxidation process significantly we find that the cu  sequestering or redox silencing property of  crystallins confers cytoprotection to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to reveal high affinity close to picomolar for cu  binding and redox silencing of cu  by any heat shock protein thus our study ascribes a novel functional role to  crystallins in cu  homeostasis and helps in understanding their protective role in neurodegenerative diseases and cataract
