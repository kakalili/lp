oh from orf virus a new tyrosine phosphatase that displays distinct structural features and triple substrate specificity
viral tyrosine phosphatases such as vh from vaccinia and variola virus are recognized as important effectors of host  pathogen interactions while proteins sharing sequence to vh have been identified in other viruses their structural and functional characterization is not known in this work we determined the crystal structure of the vh homolog in the orf virus herein named oh  similarly to variola and vaccinia vh  the structure of oh shows a dimer with the typical dual specificity phosphatase fold in contrast to vh  the oh dimer is covalently stabilized by a disulfide bond involving residue cys  in the n terminal helix alpha  of both monomers and cys  is a conserved residue within the parapoxvirus genus the in vitro functional characterization confirms that oh is a dual specificity phosphatase and reveals its ability to dephosphorylate phosphatidylinositol   bisphosphate a new activity potentially relevant in phosphoinositide recycling during virion maturation
