a conserved spiral structure for highly diverged phage tail assembly chaperones
tail assembly chaperones tacs are a family of proteins likely required for the morphogenesis of all long tailed phages in this study we determined the crystal structure of gp  the tac of phage hk  this structure is similar to that of the tac from the lactococcus phage p and two unannotated structures of likely tacs encoded in prophage derived regions of bacillus subtilis and bacillus stearothermophilus despite the high sequence divergence of these proteins gp  forms a ring structure with similar dimensions to the spirals observed in the crystal lattices of these other proteins remarkably these similar quaternary structures are formed through very different interprotomer interactions we present functional data supporting the biological relevance of these spiral structures and propose that spiral formation has been the primary requirement for these proteins during evolution this study presents an unusual example of diverged protein sequences and oligomerization mechanisms in the presence of conserved quaternary structure
