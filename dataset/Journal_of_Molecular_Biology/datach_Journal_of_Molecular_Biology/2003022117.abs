solution structure of switch arc a mutant with   helices replacing a wild type  ribbon
adjacent n l and l n mutations in the antiparallel  ribbon of arc repressor result in dramatic changes in local structure in which each  strand is replaced by a right handed helix the full solution structure of this  switch  arc mutant shows that irregular   helices compose the new secondary structure this structural metamorphosis conserves the number of main chain and side chain to main chain hydrogen bonds and the number of fully buried core residues apart from a slight widening of the interhelical angle between  helices a and b and changes in side chain conformation of a few core residues in arc no large scale structural adjustments in the remainder of the protein are necessary to accommodate the ribbon to helix change nevertheless some changes in hydrogen exchange rates are observed even in regions that have very similar structures in the two proteins the surface of switch arc is packed poorly compared to wild type leading to      of additional solvent accessible surface area and the n termini of the   helices make unfavorable head to head electrostatic interactions these structural features account for the positive m value and salt dependence of the ribbon to helix transition in arc n l a variant that can adopt either the mutant or wild type structures the tertiary fold is capped in different ways in switch and wild type arc showing how stepwise evolutionary transformations can arise through small changes in amino acid sequence
