The molecular regulation of striated muscle contraction couples the binding and dissociation of Ca2+ on troponin (Tn) to the movement of tropomyosin on actin filaments. In turn, this process exposes or blocks myosin binding sites on actin, thereby controlling myosin crossbridge dynamics and consequently muscle contraction. Using 3D electron microscopy, we recently provided structural evidence that a C-terminal extension of TnI is anchored on actin at low Ca2+ and competes with tropomyosin for a common site to drive tropomyosin to the B-state location, a constrained, relaxing position on actin that inhibits myosin-crossbridge association. Here, we show that release of this constraint at high Ca2+ allows a second segment of troponin, probably representing parts of TnT or the troponin core domain, to promote tropomyosin movement on actin to the Ca2+-induced C-state location. With tropomyosin stabilized in this position, myosin binding interactions can begin. Tropomyosin appears to oscillate to a higher degree between respective B- and C-state positions on troponin-free filaments than on fully regulated filaments, suggesting that tropomyosin positioning in both states is troponin-dependent. By biasing tropomyosin to either of these two positions, troponin appears to have two distinct structural functions; in relaxed muscles at low Ca2+, troponin operates as an inhibitor, while in activated muscles at high Ca2+, it acts as a promoter to initiate contraction.
