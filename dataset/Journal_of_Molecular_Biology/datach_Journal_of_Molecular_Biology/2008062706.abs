structural mechanism of transcriptional autorepression of the escherichia coli relb rele antitoxin toxin module
the escherichia coli chromosomal relbe operon encodes a toxin  antitoxin system which is autoregulated by its protein products relb and rele relb acts as a transcriptional repressor and rele functions as a cofactor to enhance the repressor activity of relb here we present the nmr derived structure of a relb dimer and show that a relb dimer recognizes a hexad repeat in the palindromic operator region through a ribbon  helix  helix motif our biochemical data show that two weakly associated relb dimers bind to the adjacent repeats in the   site of the operator or at a moderate affinity kd       m  however in the presence of rele a relb tetramer binds two distinct binding sites within the operator region each with an enhanced affinity kd       m for the low affinity site ol and    m for the high affinity site or  we propose that the enhanced affinity for the operator element is mediated by a cooperative dna binding by a pair of relb dimers and that the interaction between relb dimers is strongly augmented by the presence of the cognate toxin rele
