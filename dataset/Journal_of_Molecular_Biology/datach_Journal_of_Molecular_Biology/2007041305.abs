crystal structure of n acetyl  glutamyl phosphate reductase from mycobacterium tuberculosis in complex with nadp
the enzyme n acetyl  glutamyl phosphate reductase agpr catalyzes the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate nadph dependent reductive dephosphorylation of n acetyl  glutamyl phosphate to n acetylglutamate  semialdehyde this reaction is part of the arginine biosynthetic pathway that is essential for some microorganisms and plants in particular for mycobacterium tuberculosis mtb  the structures of apo mtbagpr in the space groups p    and c and the structure of mtbagpr bound to the cofactor nadp have been solved and analyzed each mtbagpr subunit consists of    and    domains nadp is bound in the cleft between them the hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts between the enzyme and cofactor have been examined comparison of the apo and the bound enzyme structures has revealed a conformational change in mtbagpr upon nadp binding namely a loop leu  to his  moves more than    to confine sterically the cofactor s adenine moiety in a hydrophobic pocket to identify the catalytically important residues in mtbagpr a docking of the substrate to the enzyme has been performed using the present structure of the mtbagpr nadp complex it reveals that residues his  and his  could form hydrogen bonds with the docked substrate in addition an ion pair could form between the substrate phosphate group and the guanidinium group of arg   these interactions optimally place and orient the substrate for subsequent nucleophilic attack by cys  on the substrate  carboxyl group his  is the most probable general base to accept a proton from cys  and an adjacent ion pair interaction with the side chain carboxyl group of glu  could help to stabilize the resulting positive charge on his   for this catalytic triad to function efficiently it requires a small conformational change of the order of    in the loop containing his  and his   this could easily result from the substrate binding
