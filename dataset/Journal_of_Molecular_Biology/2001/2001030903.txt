Unlike most DNA polymerases, reverse transcriptases can initiate DNA synthesis at a single-strand break and displace the downstream non-template strand simultaneously with extension of the primer. This reaction is important for generation of the long terminal repeat sequences in the duplex DNA product of retroviral reverse transcription. Oligonucleotide-based model displacement constructs were used to study the interaction of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptases with the DNA. Under conditions where the DNA is saturated with enzyme, there is no protection against DNase I cleavage of the 5â€² single-stranded extension that would correspond to the already-displaced strand. However, the DNase I footprint on the non-template strand extends from the +1 to the +9 position for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 enzyme and from +1 to +7 or +8 for the Moloney enzyme. This extent of protection on the non-template strand is similar to what was observed previously for the template strand downstream from the primer terminus. Use of potassium permanganate as a probe for unpaired bases in the region ahead of the primer terminus reveals that the two base-pairs immediately in front of the enzyme are melted by the bound enzyme. These findings are consistent with a displacement mechanism in which the reverse transcriptase plays an active role in unpairing the DNA ahead of the translocating polymerase. The results are interpreted in light of a recent crystal structure showing the nature of the protein-DNA contacts with the template strand ahead of the primer terminus.
