light activation of rhodopsin insights from molecular dynamics simulations guided by solid state nmr distance restraints
structural restraints provided by solid state nmr measurements of the metarhodopsin ii intermediate are combined with molecular dynamics simulations to help visualize structural changes in the light activation of rhodopsin since the timescale for the formation of the metarhodopsin ii intermediate  gt  ms is beyond that readily accessible by molecular dynamics we use nmr distance restraints derived from  c dipolar recoupling measurements to guide the simulations the simulations yield a working model for how photoisomerization of the  cis retinylidene chromophore bound within the interior of rhodopsin is coupled to transmembrane helix motion and receptor activation the mechanism of activation that emerges is that multiple switches on the extracellular or intradiscal side of rhodopsin trigger structural changes that converge to disrupt the ionic lock between helices h and h on the intracellular side of the receptor
