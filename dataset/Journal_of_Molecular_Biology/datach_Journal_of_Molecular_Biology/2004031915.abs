high resolution crystal structure of arthrobacter aurescens chondroitin ac lyase an enzyme  substrate complex defines the catalytic mechanism
chondroitin lyases ec     and ec     are glycosaminoglycan degrading enzymes that act as eliminases chondroitin lyase ac from arthrobacter aurescens arthroac is known to act on chondroitin  sulfate and chondroitin  sulfate but not on dermatan sulfate like other chondroitin ac lyases it is capable of cleaving hyaluronan we have determined the three dimensional crystal structure of arthroac in its native form as well as in complex with its substrates chondroitin  sulfate tetrasaccharide cstetra and hyaluronan tetrasaccharide at resolution varying from    to    the primary sequence of arthroac has not been previously determined but it was possible to determine the amino acid sequence of this enzyme from the high resolution electron density maps and to confirm it by mass spectrometry the enzyme  substrate complexes were obtained by soaking the substrate into the crystals for varying lengths of time   seconds to ten hours and flash cooling the crystals the electron density map for crystals soaked in the substrate for as short as  seconds showed the substrate clearly and indicated that the ring of central glucuronic acid assumes a distorted boat conformation this structure strongly supports the lytic mechanism where tyr  acts as a general base that abstracts the proton from the c position of glucuronic acid while asn  and his  neutralize the charge on the glucuronate acidic group comparison of this structure with that of chondroitinase ac from flavobacterium heparinum flavoac provides an explanation for the exolytic and endolytic mode of action of arthroac and flavoac respectively
