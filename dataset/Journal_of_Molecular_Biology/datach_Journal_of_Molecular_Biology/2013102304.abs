conservation and variability in the structure and function of the cas d endoribonuclease in the crispr mediated microbial immune system
clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats crisprs and crispr associated cas proteins form an rna mediated microbial immune system against invading foreign genetic elements cas proteins constitute one of the most prevalent cas protein families in crispr  cas systems and are predicted to have rna recognition motif rrm domains cas d is a subtype i c specific cas protein that can be divided into two distinct subgroups one of which has extra c terminal residues while the other contains a longer insertion in the middle of its n terminal rrm domain here we report crystal structures of cas d from streptococcus pyogenes and xanthomonas oryzae which respectively represent the two cas d subgroups despite a common domain architecture consisting of an n terminal rrm domain and a c terminal  sheet domain the structural differences between the two cas d proteins are highlighted by the presence of a unique extended helical region protruding from the n terminal rrm domain of x oryzae cas d we also demonstrate that cas d proteins possess not only specific endoribonuclease activity for crispr rnas but also nonspecific double stranded dna binding affinity these findings suggest that cas d may play multiple roles in crispr mediated immunity furthermore the specific rna processing was also observed between s pyogenes cas d protein and x oryzae crispr rna and vice versa this cross species activity of cas d provides a special opportunity for elucidating conserved features of the crispr rna processing event
