the folding mechanism of bbl plasticity of transition state structure observed within an ultrafast folding protein family
studies on members of protein families with similar structures but divergent sequences provide insights into the effects of sequence composition on the mechanism of folding members of the peripheral subunit binding domain psbd family fold ultrafast and approach the smallest size for cooperatively folding proteins   value analysis of the psbds e bd and pob reveals folding via nucleation  condensation through structurally very similar polarized transition states here we present a  value analysis of the family member bbl and found that it also folds by a nucleation  condensation mechanism the mean  values of bbl e bd and pob were near identical indicating similar fractions of non covalent interactions being formed in the transition state despite the overall conservation of folding mechanism in this protein family however the pattern of  values determined for bbl revealed a larger dispersion of the folding nucleus across the entire structure and the transition state was less polarized the observed plasticity of transition state structure can be rationalized by the different helix forming propensities of psbd sequences the very strong helix propensity in the first helix of bbl relative to e bd and pob appears to recruit more structure formation in that helix in the transition state at the expense of weaker interactions in the second helix differences in sequence composition can modulate transition state structure of even the smallest natural protein domains
