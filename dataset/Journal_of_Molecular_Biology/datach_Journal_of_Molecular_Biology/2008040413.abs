discrimination between distant homologs and structural analogs lessons from manually constructed reliable data sets
a natural way to study protein sequence structure and function is to put them in the context of evolution homologs inherit similarities from their common ancestor while analogs converge to similar structures due to a limited number of energetically favorable ways to pack secondary structural elements using novel strategies we previously assembled two reliable databases of homologs and analogs in this study we compare these two data sets and develop a support vector machine svm based classifier to discriminate between homologs and analogs the classifier uses a number of well known similarity scores we observe that although both structure scores and sequence scores contribute to svm performance profile sequence scores computed based on structural alignments are the best discriminators between remote homologs and structural analogs we apply our classifier to a representative set from the expert constructed database structural classification of proteins scop  the svm classifier recovers   of the remote homologs defined as domains in the same scop superfamily but from different families more importantly we also detect and discuss interesting homologous relationships between scop domains from different superfamilies folds and even classes
