intermediate type  s proteasomes in hela cells   asymmetric  subunit composition diversity and adaptation
the  s proteasomes are cylinder shaped heteromeric dimers with a subunit configuration of           replacement of the three active site containing standard  subunits         by immuno  subunits   i   i   i results in formation of  s immuno proteasomes while only partial replacement leads to intermediate type proteasomes synthesis of immuno subunits can be induced by interferon   which causes a complete transformation of three subtypes of standard proteasomes into three subtypes of intermediate type proteasomes in hela cells a process that results in a change in the proteolytic activities of the enzymes hela cells producing the proteasome   subunit tagged with the fc region binding zz domain of protein a were grown in the presence of interferon   from these cells we have purified  s proteasomes by using igg affinity resin and analysed them by d page our study showed that subunit replacement can be confined to one half of the proteasome cylinder resulting in the formation of intermediate type proteasomes with  asymmetric  subunit composition analysis of proteasomes purified from the cytoplasm nucleoplasm and microsomes of hela s cells reveals that all three compartments are furnished with intermediate type proteasomes of different subtype and subunit composition exhibiting different specific proteolytic activities
