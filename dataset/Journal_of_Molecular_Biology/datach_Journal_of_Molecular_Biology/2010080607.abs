protein  protein interactions between   region  of rna polymerase and escherichia coli soxs a transcription activator that functions by the prerecruitment mechanism evidence for  off dna  and  on dna  interactions
according to the prerecruitment hypothesis escherichia coli soxs activates the transcription of the genes of the soxrs regulon by forming binary complexes with rna polymerase rnap that scan the chromosome for class i and class ii soxs dependent promoters we showed previously that the  subunit s c terminal domain plays a role in activating both classes of promoter by making protein  protein contacts with soxs some of these contacts are made in solution in the absence of promoter dna a critical prediction of the prerecruitment hypothesis here we identified seven single alanine substitutions of the region  of      r  of rnap that reduce soxs activation of class ii promoters with genetic epistasis tests between these   r mutants and positive control mutants of soxs we identified  pairs of amino acids that interact with each other in e coli using the yeast two hybrid system and affinity immobilization assays we showed that soxs and   r can interact in solution i e   off dna   the interaction requires amino acids of the class i ii but not the class ii positive control surface of soxs and five amino acids of   r that reduce activation in e coli also reduce the soxs    r interaction in yeast one of the epistatic interactions that occur in e coli also occurs in the yeast two hybrid system i e  off dna  importantly we infer that the five epistatic interactions occurring in e coli that require an amino acid of the class ii surface occur  on dna  at class ii promoters finding that soxs contacts   r both off dna and on dna is consistent with the prerecruitment hypothesis moreover soxs is now the first example of an e coli transcriptional activator that uses a single positive control surface to make specific protein  protein contacts with two different subunits of rnap
