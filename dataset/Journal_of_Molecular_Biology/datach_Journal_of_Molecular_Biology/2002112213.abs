limits of cooperativity in a structurally modular protein response of the notch ankyrin domain to analogous alanine substitutions in each repeat
to determine the limits of cooperativity in a structurally modular protein we characterized the structure and stability of glycine variants of the ankyrin repeat domain from the drosophila melangaster notch receptor the substitutions are of analogous alanine residues to glycine in each repeat and allow the same perturbation to be examined at different positions in the protein the ankyrin domain is insensitive to substitution in repeat one suggesting that the first repeat is not fully folded glycine substitutions in repeat two through seven are strongly destabilizing but the variants retain their overall secondary and tertiary structures spectroscopic and calorimetric data are consistent with two state unfolding transitions for the repeat two through repeat five glycine variants and for the wild type protein these data indicate that despite its modular structure the notch ankyrin domain unfolds as a cooperative unit consisting of the six c terminal repeats and that this cooperativity is maintained in the presence of severely destabilizing substitutions in the n terminal and central repeats in contrast glycine substitution in repeat six leads to a multi state unfolding transition suggesting that the coupling that gives rise to long range cooperativity in the wild type protein may have a weak link in the c terminal region such behavior is captured by a simple statistical thermodynamic model in which an unstable c terminal region is coupled to a stable n terminal region through a strongly stabilizing interface
