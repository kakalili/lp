the central ppt of the yeast retrotransposon ty is not essential for transposition
the yeast retrotransposon ty has structural and functional similarities to retroviruses we report here that as in retroviruses the plus strand dna of ty is synthesized as two segments a central dna flap is formed during reverse transcription consecutive to elongation with strand displacement of the upstream segment beyond the central polypurine tract cppt until the replication machinery is stopped at the central termination sequence comparison of wild type and cppt mutant ty elements shows that the mutant element lacking the central dna flap is only twofold defective in transposition
