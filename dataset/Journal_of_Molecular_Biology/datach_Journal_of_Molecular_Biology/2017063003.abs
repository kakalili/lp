polycomb group gene e z is required for spermatogonial dedifferentiation in drosophila adult testis
dedifferentiation is an important process to replenish lost stem cells during aging or regeneration after injury to maintain tissue homeostasis here we report that enhancer of zeste e z  a component of the polycomb repression complex  prc  is required to maintain a stable pool of germline stem cells gscs within the niche microenvironment during aging germ cells with reduced e z activity cannot meet that requirement but the defect arises from neither increased gsc death nor premature differentiation instead we found evidence that the decrease of gscs upon the inactivation of e z in the germline could be attributed to defective dedifferentiation during recovery from genetically manipulated gsc depletion e z knockdown germ cells also fail to replenish lost gscs taken together our data suggest that e z acts intrinsically in germ cells to activate dedifferentiation and thus replenish lost gscs during both aging and tissue regeneration
