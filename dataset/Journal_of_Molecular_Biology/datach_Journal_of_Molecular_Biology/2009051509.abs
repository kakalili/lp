nmr structure of the amino terminal domain of the lambda integrase protein in complex with dna immobilization of a flexible tail facilitates beta sheet recognition of the major groove
the integrase protein int from bacteriophage lambda is the archetypal member of the tyrosine recombinase family a large group of enzymes that rearrange dna in all domains of life int catalyzes the insertion and excision of the viral genome into and out of the escherichia coli chromosome recombination transpires within higher order nucleoprotein complexes that form when its amino terminal domain binds to arm type dna sequences that are located distal to the site of strand exchange arm site binding by int is essential for catalysis as it promotes int mediated bridge structures that stabilize the recombination machinery we have elucidated how int is able to sequence specifically recognize the arm type site sequence by determining the solution structure of its amino terminal domain intn residues met to leu  in complex with its p   dna binding site previous studies have shown that intn adopts a rare monomeric dna binding fold that consists of a three stranded antiparallel beta sheet that is packed against a carboxy terminal alpha helix a low resolution crystal structure of the full length protein also revealed that the sheet is inserted into the major groove of the arm type site the solution structure presented here reveals how intn specifically recognizes the arm type site sequence a novel feature of the new solution structure is the use of an  residue tail that is located at the amino terminus dna binding induces the folding of a   helix in the tail that projects the amino terminus of the protein deep into the minor groove for stabilizing dna contacts this finding reveals the structural basis for the observation that the  unstructured  amino terminus is required for recombination
