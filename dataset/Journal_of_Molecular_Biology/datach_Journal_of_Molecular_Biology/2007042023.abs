evolution of budding yeast prion determinant sequences across diverse fungi
prions are transmissible self replicating alternative states of proteins four prions  psi   ure   rnq  and nu  can be inherited cytoplasmically in saccharomyces cerevisiae laboratory strains in the case of psi  there is increasing evidence that prion formation may engender mechanisms to uncover hidden genetic variation here we have analysed the evolution of the prion determinant pd domains across  fungi focusing on compositional biases repeats and substitution rates we find evidence for constraint on all four pd domains but each domain has its own evolutionary dynamics for psi  the q n bias is maintained in fungal clades that diverged one billion years ago with purifying selection observed within the saccharomyces species the degree of q n bias is correlated with the degree of local homology to prion associated repeats which occur rarely in other proteins  lt  of sequences for the proteomes studied  the evolutionary conservation of q n bias in sup p is unusual with only eight other s cerevisiae proteins showing similar phylogenetically deep patterns of bias conservation the ure  pd domain is unique to hemiascomycota part of the pd domain shows purifying selection whereas another part engenders bias changes between clades also like for sup p the rnq  and nu  pd domains show purifying selection in saccharomyces species additionally in each proteome we observe on average several hundred yeast prion like domains with fewest in fission yeast our findings on yeast prion evolution provide further support for the functional significance of these molecules
