nuclear protein only ribonuclease p structure and biochemical characterization provide insight into the conserved properties of trna   end processing enzymes
protein only rnase ps prorps are a recently discovered class of rna processing enzymes that catalyze maturation of the   end of precursor trnas in eukaryotes prorps are found in the nucleus and or organelles of most eukaryotic organisms arabidopsis thaliana is a representative organism that contains prorp enzymes prorp  prorp and prorp  in both its nucleus and its organelles prorp and prorp localize to the nucleus and prorp localizes to the chloroplast and the mitochondria apart from their identification almost nothing is known about the structure and function of prorps that act in the nucleus here we use a combination of biochemical assays and x ray crystallography to characterize a thaliana prorp  we solved the crystal structure of prorp     revealing an overall v shaped protein and conserved metallonuclease active site structure our biochemical studies indicate that prorp requires mg  for catalysis and catalyzes the maturation of nuclear encoded substrates up to  fold faster than mitochondrial encoded precursor nad t element under single turnover conditions we also demonstrate that prorp preferentially binds precursor trnas containing short   leaders and   trailers however leader and trailer lengths do not significantly alter the observed rate constants of prorp in single turnover cleavage assays our data provide a biochemical and structural framework to begin understanding how nuclear localized prorps recognize and cleave their substrates
