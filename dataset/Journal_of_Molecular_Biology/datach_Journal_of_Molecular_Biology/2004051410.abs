analysis of human tyrosyl dna phosphodiesterase i catalytic residues
tyrosyl dna phosphodiesterase i tdp  is involved in the repair of dna lesions created by topoisomerase i in vivo tdp is a member of the phospholipase d pld superfamily of enzymes and hydrolyzes   phosphotyrosyl bonds to generate   phosphate dna and free tyrosine in vitro here we use synthetic     nitro phenyl     methyl phenyl and   tyrosine phosphate oligonucleotides to study human tdp  kinetic analysis of human tdp  htdp  shows that the enzyme has nanomolar affinity for all three substrates and the overall in vitro reaction is diffusion limited analysis of active site mutants using these modified substrates demonstrates that htdp uses an acid base catalytic mechanism the results show that histidine   serves as the general acid during the initial transesterification in agreement with hypotheses based on previous crystal structure models the results also argue that lysine   and asparagine   participate in the general acid reaction and the analysis of crystal structures suggests that these residues may function in a proton relay together with previous crystal structure data the new functional data provide a mechanistic understanding of the conserved histidine lysine and asparagine residues found among all pld family members
