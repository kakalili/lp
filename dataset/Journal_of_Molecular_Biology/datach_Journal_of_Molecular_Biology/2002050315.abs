towards structural genomics of rna rapid nmr resonance assignment and simultaneous rna tertiary structure determination using residual dipolar couplings
we report a new residual dipolar couplings rdcs based nmr procedure for rapidly determining rna tertiary structure demonstrated on a uniformly  n  c labeled  nt variant of the trans activation response element tar rna from hiv i in this procedure the time consuming nuclear overhauser enhancement noe based sequential assignment step is replaced by a fully automated rdc based assignment strategy this approach involves examination of all allowed sequence specific resonance assignment permutations for best fit agreement between measured rdcs and coordinates for sub structures in a target rna using idealized a form geometries to model watson  crick helices and coordinates from a previous x ray structure to model a hairpin loop in tar the best fit rdc assignment solutions are determined very rapidly  lt five minutes of computational time and are in complete agreement with corresponding noe based assignments orientational constraints derived from rdcs are used simultaneously to assemble sub structures into an rna tertiary conformation through enhanced speeds of application and reduced reliance on chemical shift dispersion this rdc based approach lays the foundation for rapidly determining rna conformations in a structural genomics context and may increase the size limit of rnas that can be examined by nmr
