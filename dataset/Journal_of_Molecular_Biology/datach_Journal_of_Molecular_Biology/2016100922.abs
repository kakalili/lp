structure based insights into the role of the cys  tyr crosslink and inhibitor recognition by mammalian cysteine dioxygenase
in mammals the non heme iron enzyme cysteine dioxygenase cdo helps regulate cys levels through converting cys to cys sulfinic acid its activity is in part modulated by the formation of a cys   tyr  crosslink that increases its catalytic efficiency over  fold here   high resolution mammalian cdo structures are used to gain insight into how the cys  tyr crosslink promotes activity and how select competitive inhibitors bind crystal structures of crosslink deficient c a and y  f variants reveal similar     shifts in the side chain of residue   and both variant structures have a new chloride ion coordinating the active site iron cys binding is also different from wild type cdo and no cys persulfenate forms in the c a or y  f active sites at ph  or   we conclude that the crosslink enhances activity by positioning the tyr  hydroxyl to enable proper cys binding proper oxygen binding and optimal chemistry in addition structures are presented for homocysteine hcy  d cys thiosulfate and azide bound as competitive inhibitors the observed binding modes of hcy and d cys clarify why they are not substrates and the binding of azide shows that in contrast to what has been proposed it does not bind in these crystals as a superoxide mimic
