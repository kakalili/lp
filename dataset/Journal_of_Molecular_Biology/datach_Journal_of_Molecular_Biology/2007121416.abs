solution structure of inhibitor free human metalloelastase mmp   indicates an internal conformational adjustment
macrophage metalloelastase or matrix metalloproteinase   mmp   appears to exacerbate atherosclerosis emphysema aortic aneurysm rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease an inactivating e  a mutation validated by crystallography and nmr spectra prevents autolysis of mmp  and allows us to determine its nmr structure without an inhibitor the structural ensemble of the catalytic domain without an inhibitor is based on   nuclear overhauser effects noes and has an average rmsd to the mean structure of     for the backbone and     for all heavy atoms for residues trp  gly   compared to crystal structures of mmp   helix b hb at the active site is unexpectedly more deeply recessed under the  sheet this opens a pocket between hb and  strand iv in the active site cleft both hb and an internal cavity are shifted toward  strand i   strand iii and helix a on the back side of the protease about  internal noe contacts distinguish the inhibitor free solution structure and indicate hb s greater depth and proximity to the sheet and helix a line broadening and multiplicity of amide proton nmr peaks from hb are consistent with hb undergoing a slow conformational exchange among subtly different environments inhibitor binding induced perturbations of the nmr spectra of mmp  and mmp  map to similar locations across mmp  and encompass the internal conformational adjustments evolutionary trace analysis suggests a functionally important network of residues that encompasses most of the locations adjusting in conformation including  residues with noe contacts unique to inhibitor free mmp   the conformational change sequence analysis and inhibitor perturbations of nmr spectra agree on the network they identify between structural scaffold and the active site of mmps
