evidence for recycling of external guide sequences during cleavage of bipartite substrates in vitro by reconstituted archaeal rnase p
rna mediated rna cleavage events are being increasingly exploited to disrupt rna function an important objective in post genomic biology rnase p a ribonucleoprotein enzyme that catalyzes the removal of   leaders from precursor trnas has previously been utilized for sequence specific cleavage of cellular rnas in one of these strategies borne out in bacterial and mammalian cell culture an external guide sequence egs rna base paired to a target rna makes the latter a substrate for endogenous rnase p by rendering the bipartite target rna  egs complex a precursor trna structural mimic in this study we first obtained evidence that four different mesophilic and thermophilic archaeal rnase p holoenzymes reconstituted in vitro using their respective constituent rna and protein subunits recognize and cleave such substrate  egs complexes we further demonstrate that these egss engage in multiple rounds of substrate recognition while assisting archaeal rnase p mediated cleavage of a target rna in vitro taken together the egs based approach merits consideration as a gene knockdown tool in archaea
