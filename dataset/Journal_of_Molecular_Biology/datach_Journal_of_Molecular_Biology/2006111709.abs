direct observation of oligomeric species formed in the early stages of amyloid fibril formation using electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry
numerous debilitating human disorders result from protein misfolding and amyloid formation despite the grave nature of these maladies our understanding of the structural mechanism of fibril assembly is limited of paramount importance is the need to identify and characterize oligomeric species formed early during fibril assembly so that the nature of the initiating assembly mechanism can be revealed and species that may be toxic to cells identified however the transient nature of early oligomeric species combined with their heterogeneity and instability has precluded detailed analysis to date here we have used electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry esi ms  complemented by analytical ultracentrifugation auc and measurements of thioflavin t fluorescence to monitor the early stages of assembly of amyloid like fibrils formed from human beta  microglobulin   m in vitro we show that worm like fibrils that form with nucleation independent kinetics assemble by a mechanism consistent with monomer addition with species ranging from monomer to    mer being identified directly and uniquely as transient assembly intermediates by contrast only monomers dimers trimers and tetramers are observed during nucleated growth which leads to the formation of long straight fibrils the results highlight the unique power of non covalent esi ms to identify protein assembly intermediates in complex heterogeneous systems and demonstrate its great potential to identify and characterise individual species formed early during amyloid assembly
