mapping the energy landscape of repeat proteins using nmr detected hydrogen exchange
repeat proteins contain tandem arrays of a simple structural motif in contrast to globular proteins repeat proteins are stabilized only by interactions between residues that are relatively close together in the sequence with no  long range  interactions our work focuses on the tetratricopeptide repeat tpr  a  amino acid helix turn helix motif found in tandem arrays in many natural proteins earlier we reported the design and characterization of a series of consensus tpr ctpr proteins which are built as arrays of multiple tandem copies of a  amino acid consensus sequence here we present the results of extensive hydrogen exchange hx studies of the folding  unfolding behavior of two ctpr proteins ctpr and ctpr  we used hx to detect and characterize partially folded species that are populated at low frequency in the nominally folded state we show that for both proteins the equilibrium folding  unfolding transition is non two state but sequential with the outermost helices showing a significantly higher probability than inner helices of being unfolded we show that the experimentally observed unfolding behavior is consistent with the predictions of a simple ising model in which individual helices are treated as  spin equivalents   the results that we present have general implications for our understanding of the thermodynamic properties of repeat proteins
