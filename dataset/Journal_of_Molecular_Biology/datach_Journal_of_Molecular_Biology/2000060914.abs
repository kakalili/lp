phylogenetic analysis of the cadherin superfamily allows identification of six major subfamilies besides several solitary members edited by m yaniv
cadherins play an important role in specific cell cell adhesion events their expression appears to be tightly regulated during development and each tissue or cell type shows a characteristic pattern of cadherin molecules inappropriate regulation of their expression levels or functionality has been observed in human malignancies in many cases leading to aggravated cancer cell invasion and metastasis the cadherins form a superfamily with at least six subfamilies which can be distinguished on the basis of protein domain composition genomic structure and phylogenetic analysis of the protein sequences these subfamilies comprise classical or type i cadherins atypical or type ii cadherins desmocollins desmogleins protocadherins and flamingo cadherins in addition several cadherins clearly occupy isolated positions in the cadherin superfamily cadherin          dachsous ret fat megf and most invertebrate cadherins  we suggest a different evolutionary origin of the protocadherin and flamingo cadherin genes versus the genes encoding desmogleins desmocollins classical cadherins and atypical cadherins the present phylogenetic analysis may accelerate the functional investigation of the whole cadherin superfamily by allowing focused research of prototype cadherins within each subfamily
