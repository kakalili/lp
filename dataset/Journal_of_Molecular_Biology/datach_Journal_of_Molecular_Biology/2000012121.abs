engineered zinc finger proteins that respond to dna modification by haeiii and hhai methyltransferase enzymes edited by t richmond
zinc finger modules are capable of specifically interacting with dna that contains  methylcytosine  mc in place of cytosine suggesting that zinc finger dna binding could be regulated by extrinsic methylation of dna here we have used phage display to engineer zinc finger proteins that detect and discriminate dna methylation by the prokaryotic enzymes haeiii and hhai in these systems zinc finger dna complexes are induced by dna modification using the appropriate enzyme which can therefore act as a switch to further develop the specificity of the switch zinc finger discrimination between  mc and thymine in dna sequences is demonstrated despite the presence of the characteristic major groove methyl group that is common to both bases specificity was achieved using a dna binding strategy involving synergy between adjacent zinc fingers we propose that engineered zinc fingers that recognise particular dna modifications such as sequence specific dna methylation could be integrated into artificial regulatory circuits for the control of gene expression and other biological processes
