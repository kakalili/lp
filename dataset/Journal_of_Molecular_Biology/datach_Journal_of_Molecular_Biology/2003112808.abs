domain motions in groel upon binding of an oligopeptide
groel assists protein folding by preventing the interaction of partially folded molecules with other non native proteins it binds them sequesters them and then releases them so that they can fold in an atp driven cycle previous studies have also shown that protein substrates groes and oligopeptides bind to partially overlapped sites on the apical domain surfaces of groel in this study we have determined the crystal structure at    resolution of a symmetric groel  peptide  complex the binding of each of these small  amino acid residue peptides to groel involves interactions between three adjacent apical domains of groel each peptide interacts primarily with a single groel subunit residues r  and r  from adjacent subunits isolate each substrate binding pocket and prevent bound substrates from sliding into adjacent binding pockets as a consequence of peptide binding domains rotate and inter domain interactions are greatly enhanced the direction of rotation of the apical domain of each groel subunit is opposite to that of its intermediate domain viewed from outside the apical domains rotate clockwise within one groel ring while the atp induced apical domain rotation is counter clockwise
