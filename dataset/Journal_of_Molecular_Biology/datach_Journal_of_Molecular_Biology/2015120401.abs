the bacterial transcription termination factor rho coordinates mg  homeostasis with translational signals
the bacterial protein rho triggers transcription termination at the ends of many operons and when transcription and translation become uncoupled in addition to these genome wide activities rho implements regulation of specific genes by dictating whether rna polymerase terminates transcription within the   leader region or continues into the downstream coding region here we report that the mg  channel gene cora in salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium which was previously thought to be constitutively expressed is regulated by a rho dependent terminator located within its   leader region we demonstrate that the unusually long and highly conserved cora leader mrna can adopt two mutually exclusive conformations that determine whether or not rho interacts with a rho utilization site on the nascent rna and thereby prevents transcription of the cora coding region the rna conformation that promotes rho dependent termination is favored by efficient translation of corl a short open reading frame located within the cora leader thus cora transcription is inversely coupled to corl translation this mechanism resembles those governing expression of salmonella s other two mg  transport genes suggesting that rho links mg  uptake to translational signals
