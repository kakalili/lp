mechanism of host cell mapk erk  incorporation into lentivirus particles characterization of the interaction between mapk erk  and proline rich domain containing capsid region of structural protein gag
the characteristic event that follows infection of a cell by retroviruses including human immunodeficiency virus hiv  simian immunodeficiency virus siv is the formation of a reverse transcription complex in which viral nucleic acids are synthesized nuclear transport of newly synthesized viral dna requires phosphorylation of proteins in the reverse transcription complex by virion associated cellular kinases recently we demonstrated that disruption of cellular mitogen activated protein kinase mapk extracellular signal regulated kinase  erk  incorporation into siv virions inhibits virus replication in nonproliferating target cells indicating that mapk erk  plays an important role in hiv siv replication the mechanism of incorporation of mapk erk  into virus particles is not defined in this regard we hypothesized that a likely interaction of mapk erk  with gagp  may enable its packaging into virus particles in the present investigation we provided evidence for the first time that mapk erk  interacts with the structural gag polyprotein p  using a combination of mutagenesis and protein  protein interaction analysis we further show that mapk erk  interacts specifically with the poly proline motif present in the capsid region of gagp  utilizing virus like particles directed by gag we have shown that the exchange of conserved proline residues within capsid of gagp  resulted in impaired incorporation of mapk erk  in addition the deletion of a domain comprising amino acids   to   within host cell mapk erk  abrogates its interaction with gagp  the relevance of the poly proline motif is further evident by its conservation in diverse retroviruses as noted from the sequence analysis and structural modeling studies of predicted amino acid sequences of the corresponding gag proteins collectively these data suggest that the interaction of mapk erk  with gag polyprotein results in its incorporation into virus particles and may be essential for retroviral replication
