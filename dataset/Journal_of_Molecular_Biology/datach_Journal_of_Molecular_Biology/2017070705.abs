enhanced local disorder in a clinically elusive von willebrand factor provokes high affinity platelet clumping
mutation of the cysteines forming the disulfide loop of the platelet gpib  adhesive a domain of von willebrand factor vwf causes quantitative vwf deficiencies in the blood and von willebrand disease we report two cases of transient severe thrombocytopenia induced by ddavp treatment cys  trp and cys  tyr mutations identified by genetic sequencing implicate an abnormal gain of function phenotype evidenced by thrombocytopenia which quickly relapses back to normal platelet counts and deficient plasma vwf using surface plasmon resonance analytical rheology and hydrogen  deuterium exchange mass spectrometry hxms  we decipher mechanisms of a gpib  mediated platelet adhesion and resolve dynamic secondary structure elements that regulate the binding pathway constrained by the disulfide conformational selection between weak and tight binding states of a takes precedence and drives normal platelet adhesion to vwf less restrained through mutation loss of the disulfide preferentially diverts binding through an induced fit disease pathway enabling high affinity gpib  binding and firm platelet adhesion to a partially disordered a domain hxms reveals a dynamic asymmetry of flexible and ordered regions common to both variants indicating that the partially disordered a lacking the disulfide retains native like structural dynamics both binding mechanisms share common structural and thermodynamic properties but the enhanced local disorder in the disease state perpetuates high affinity platelet agglutination characteristic of type b vwd upon ddavp stimulated secretion of vwf leading to transient thrombocytopenia and a subsequent deficiency of plasma vwf characteristic of type a vwd
