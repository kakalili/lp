arabidopsis thaliana glutamate receptor ion channel function demonstrated by ion pore transplantation
ionotropic glutamate receptors iglurs are ligand gated cation channels that mediate fast excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian central nervous system in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana a large family of  genes encoding proteins that share similarities with animal iglurs in sequence and predicted secondary structure has been discovered members of this family termed atglrs a thaliana glutamate receptors  have been implicated in root development ion transport and several metabolic and signalling pathways however there is still no direct proof of ligand gated ion channel function of any atglr subunit we used a domain transplantation technique to directly test whether the putative ion pore domains of atglrs can conduct ions to this end we transplanted the ion pore domains of  atglr subunits into rat  amino  hydroxy  methyl  isoxazole propionate glur  and kainate glur  receptor subunits and tested the resulting chimaeras for ion channel function in the xenopus oocyte expression system we show that atglr  and atglr  have functional na  k  and ca  permeable ion pore domains the properties of currents through the atglr  ion pore match those of glutamate activated currents depolarisations and glutamate triggered ca  influxes observed in plant cells we conclude that some atglrs have functional non selective cation pores
