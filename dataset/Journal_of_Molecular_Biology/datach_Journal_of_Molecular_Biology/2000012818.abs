identification of a penta and hexapeptide of islet amyloid polypeptide iapp with amyloidogenic and cytotoxic properties edited by r huber
pancreatic amyloid is found in more than   of type ii diabetes patients pancreatic amyloid is formed by the aggregation of islet amyloid polypeptide hiapp or amylin  which is a  residue peptide because pancreatic amyloid is cytotoxic it is believed that its formation is directly associated with the development of the disease we recently showed that hiapp amyloid formation follows the nucleation dependent polymerization mechanism and proceeds via a conformational transition of soluble hiapp into aggregated  sheets here we report that the penta and hexapeptide sequences hiapp      fgail and hiapp      nfgail of hiapp are sufficient for the formation of  sheet containing amyloid fibrils although these two peptides differ by only one amino acid residue they aggregate into completely different fibrillar assemblies hiapp      fgail fibrils self assemble laterally into unusually broad ribbons whereas hiapp      nfgail fibrils coil around each other in a typical amyloid fibril morphology hiapp      snnfgail also aggregates into  sheet containing fibrils whereas no amyloidogenicity is found for hiapp      gail  indicating that hiapp      fgail is the shortest fibrillogenic sequence of hiapp insoluble amyloid formation by the partial hiapp sequences followed kinetics that were consistent with a nucleation dependent polymerization mechanism hiapp      nfgail  hiapp      snnfgail  and also the known fibrillogenic sequence hiapp      snnfgailss exhibited significantly lower kinetic and thermodynamic solubilities than the pentapeptide hiapp      fgail  fibrils formed by all short peptide sequences and also by hiapp     were cytotoxic towards the pancreatic cell line rin fm whereas no cytotoxicity was observed for the soluble form of the peptides a notion that is consistent with hiapp cytotoxicity our results suggest that a penta and hexapeptide sequence of an appropriate amino acid composition can be sufficient for  sheet and amyloid fibril formation and cytotoxicity and may assist in the rational design of inhibitors of pancreatic amyloid formation or other amyloidosis related diseases
