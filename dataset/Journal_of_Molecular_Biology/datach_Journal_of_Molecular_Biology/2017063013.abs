systematic analysis of known and candidate lysine demethylases in the regulation of myoblast differentiation
histone methylation dynamics plays a critical role in cellular programming during development for example specific lysine methyltransferases kmts and lysine demethylases kdms have been implicated in the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into various cell lineages however a systematic and functional analysis for an entire family of kmt or kdm enzymes has not been performed here we test the function of all the known and candidate kdms in myoblast and osteoblast differentiation using the c c  cell differentiation model system our analysis identified that lsd is the only kdm required for myogenic differentiation and that kdm b kdm a and kdm are the candidate kdms required for osteoblast differentiation we find that lsd  via h k me demethylation represses the master regulator of osteoblast differentiation runx to promote myogenesis in the c c  model system finally mll is required for efficient osteoblast differentiation in part by countering lsd h k me demethylation at the runx enhancer together our findings provide additional mechanisms by which lysine methylation signaling impacts on cell fate decisions
