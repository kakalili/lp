molecular mechanism of transcription inhibition by phage t gp protein
escherichia coli t bacteriophage gp protein is a potent inhibitor of host rna polymerase rnap  gp inhibits formation of open promoter complex by binding to the    jaw an rnap domain that interacts with downstream promoter dna here we used an engineered promoter with an optimized sequence to obtain and characterize a specific promoter complex containing rnap and gp  in this complex localized melting of promoter dna is initiated but does not propagate to include the point of the transcription start as a result the complex is transcriptionally inactive using a highly sensitive rnap beacon assay we performed quantitative real time measurements of specific binding of the rnap  gp complex to promoter dna and various promoter fragments in this way the effect of gp on rnap interaction with promoters was dissected as expected gp greatly decreased rnap affinity to downstream promoter duplex however gp also inhibited rnap binding to promoter fragments that lacked downstream promoter dna that interacts with the    jaw the inhibition was caused by gp mediated decrease of the rnap binding affinity to template and non template strand segments of the transcription bubble downstream of the    promoter element the inhibition of rnap interactions with single stranded segments of the transcription bubble by gp is a novel effect which may occur via allosteric mechanism that is set in motion by the gp binding to the    jaw
