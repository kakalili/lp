toxoplasma h a variants reveal novel insights into nucleosome composition and functions for this histone family
toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite toxoplasmosis is incurable because of its ability to differentiate from the rapidly replicating tachyzoite stage into a latent cyst form bradyzoite stage  gene regulation pertinent to toxoplasma differentiation involves histone modification but very little is known about the histone proteins in this early branching eukaryote here we report the characterization of three h a histones variants h ax and h az and a canonical h a  h az is the minor parasite h a member h a and h ax both have an sq motif but only h ax has a complete sq e d   where  denotes a hydrophobic residue known to be phosphorylated in response to dna damage we show that a novel h b variant interacts with h az and h a but not with h ax chromatin immunoprecipitation chip revealed that h az and h bv are enriched at active genes while h ax is enriched at repressed genes as well as the silent tgire repeat element during dna damage we detected an increase in h ax phosphorylation as well as increases in h a and h ax transcription we found that expression of h ax but not h a or h az increases in bradyzoites generated in vitro similar analysis performed on mature bradyzoites generated in vivo which are arrested in g  showed that h az and h ax are expressed but h a is not consistent with the idea that h a is the canonical histone orthologue in the parasite the increase of h ax which localizes to silenced areas during bradyzoite differentiation is consistent with the quiescent nature of this stage of the life cycle our results indicate that the early branching eukaryotic parasite toxoplasma contains nucleosomes of novel composition which is likely to impact multiple facets of parasite biology including the clinically important process of bradyzoite differentiation
