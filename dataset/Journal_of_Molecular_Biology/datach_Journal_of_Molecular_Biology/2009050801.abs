the c  ring from a thermoalkaliphilic atp synthase reveals an extended diameter due to a special structural region
we have structurally characterized the c ring from the thermoalkaliphilic bacillus sp strain ta a f fo atp synthase atomic force microscopy imaging and cryo electron microscopy analyses confirm previous mass spectrometric data indicating that this c ring contains  c subunits the cryo electron microscopy map obtained from two dimensional crystals shows less closely packed helices in the inner ring compared to those of na binding c  rings the inner ring of  helices in c  rings harbors a conserved gxgxgxgxg motif with glycines located at the interface between c subunits which is responsible for the close packing of these helices this glycine motif is altered in the c  ring of bacillus sp strain ta a to axgxsxgxs leading to a change in c  c subunit contacts and thereby enlarging the c ring diameter to host a greater number of c subunits an altered glycine motif is a typical feature of c subunit sequences in alkaliphilic bacillus species we propose that enlarged c rings in proton dependent f atp synthases may represent an adaptation to facilitate atp synthesis at low overall proton motive force as occurs in bacteria that grow at alkaline ph
