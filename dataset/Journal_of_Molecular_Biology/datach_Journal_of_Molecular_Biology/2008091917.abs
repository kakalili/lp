the crystal structure of ump kinase from bacillus anthracis ba   reveals an allosteric nucleotide binding site
uridine monophosphate ump kinase is a conserved enzyme that catalyzes the atp driven conversion of uridylate monophosphate into uridylate diphosphate an essential metabolic step in prokaryotes the enzyme exists as a homohexamer that is regulated by various metabolites whereas the enzymatic mechanism of ump kinase uk is well characterized the molecular basis of its regulation remains poorly understood here we report the crystal structure of uk from bacillus anthracis ba   in complex with atp at     resolution it reveals that the cofactor in addition to binding in the active sites also interacts with separate binding pockets located near the center of the hexameric structure the existence of such an allosteric binding site had been predicted by biochemical studies but it was not identified in previous crystal structures of prokaryotic uks we show that this putative allosteric pocket is conserved across different bacterial species suggesting that it is a feature common to bacterial uks and we present a structural model for the allosteric regulation of this enzyme
