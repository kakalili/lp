a non active site set domain surface crucial for the interaction of mll and the rbbp ash l heterodimer within mll family core complexes
the mixed lineage leukemia  mll  enzyme is a histone h lysine  h k  monomethyltransferase and has served as a paradigm for understanding the mechanism of action of the human set family of enzymes that include mll  mll and setd a b dimethylation of h k requires a sub complex including wrad wdr  rbbp  ash l and dpy   which binds to each set family member forming a minimal core complex that is required for multiple lysine methylation we recently demonstrated that wrad is a novel histone methyltransferase that preferentially catalyzes h k dimethylation in a manner that is dependent on an unknown non active site surface from the mll set domain recent genome sequencing studies have identified a number of human disease associated missense mutations that localize to the set domains of several mll family members in this investigation we mapped many of these mutations onto the three dimensional structure of the set domain and noticed that a subset of mll  kmt d alr mll  associated kabuki syndrome missense mutations map to a common solvent exposed surface that is not expected to alter enzymatic activity we introduced these mutations into the mll set domain and observed that all are defective for h k dimethylation by the mll core complex which is associated with a loss of the ability of mll to interact with wrad or with the rbbp ash l heterodimer our results suggest that amino acids from this surface which we term the kabuki interaction surface or kis are required for formation of a second active site within set family core complexes
