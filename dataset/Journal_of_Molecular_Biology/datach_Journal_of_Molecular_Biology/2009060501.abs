crystal structure of red chlorophyll catabolite reductase enlargement of the ferredoxin dependent bilin reductase family
the key steps in the degradation pathway of chlorophylls are the ring opening reaction catalyzed by pheophorbide a oxygenase and sequential reduction by red chlorophyll catabolite reductase rccr  during these steps chlorophyll catabolites lose their color and phototoxicity rccr catalyzes the ferredoxin dependent reduction of the c  c double bond of red chlorophyll catabolite rccr appears to be evolutionarily related to the ferredoxin dependent bilin reductase fdbr family which synthesizes a variety of phytobilin pigments on the basis of sequence similarity ferredoxin dependency and the common tetrapyrrole skeleton of their substrates the evidence however is not robust the identity between rccr and fdbr hy from arabidopsis thaliana is only   and the oligomeric states of these enzymes are different here we report the crystal structure of a thaliana rccr at     resolution rccr forms a homodimer in which each subunit folds in an     sandwich the tertiary structure of rccr is similar to those of fdbrs strongly supporting that these enzymes evolved from a common ancestor the two subunits are related by noncrystallographic  fold symmetry in which the  helices near the edge of the  sheet unique in rccr participate in intersubunit interaction the putative rcc binding site which was derived by superimposing rccr onto biliverdin bound forms of fdbrs forms an open pocket surrounded by conserved residues among rccrs glu  and asp  of a thaliana rccr which stand opposite each other in the pocket likely are involved in substrate binding and or catalysis
