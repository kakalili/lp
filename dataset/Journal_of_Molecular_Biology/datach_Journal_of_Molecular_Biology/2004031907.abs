nmr structure of the   nucleotide core encapsidation signal of the moloney murine leukemia virus
the full length positive strand genome of the moloney murine leukemia virus contains a  core encapsidation signal  that is essential for efficient genome packaging during virus assembly we have determined the structure of a   nucleotide rna that contains this signal called m  using a novel isotope edited nmr approach the method is robust and should be generally applicable to larger rnas m  folds into three stem loops two of which sl c and sl d co stack to form an extended helix the third stem loop sl b is connected to sl c by a flexible four nucleotide linker the structure contains five mismatched base pairs an unusual c cg base triple platform and a novel  a minor k turn   in which unpaired adenosine bases a  and a  of a ggaa bulge pack in the minor groove of a proximal stem and a bulged distal uridine u   forms a hydrogen bond with the phosphodiester of a   phylogenetic analyses indicate that these essential structural elements are conserved among the murine c type retroviruses
