functional similarities and differences of an archaeal hsp  dnak stress protein compared with its homologue from the bacterium escherichia coli
archaea are prokaryotes but some of their chaperoning systems resemble those of eukaryotes also not all archaea possess the stress protein hsp  dnak  in contrast with bacteria and eukaryotes which possess it without any known exception further the primary structure of the archaeal dnak resembles more the bacterial than the eukaryotic homologues the work reported here addresses two questions is the archaeal hsp  protein a chaperone like its homologues in the other two phylogenetic domains and if so is the chaperoning mechanism of bacterial or eukaryotic type the data have shown that the dnak protein of the archaeon methanosarcina mazei functions efficiently as a chaperone in luciferase renaturation in vitro and that it requires dnaj and the other bacterial type chaperone grpe to perform its function the m mazei dnak chaperone activity was enhanced by interaction with the bacterial co chaperone dnaj but not by the eukaryotic homologue hdj  both the bacterial grpe and dnaj stimulated the atpase activity of the m mazei dnak the m mazei dnak dependent chaperoning pathway in vitro is similar to that of the bacterium escherichia coli used for comparison however in vivo analyses indicate that there are also significant differences the m mazei dnaj and grpe genes rescued e coli mutants lacking these genes but e coli dnak mutants were not complemented by the m mazei dnak gene thus while the data from in vitro tests demonstrate functional similarities between the m mazei and e coli dnak proteins in vivo results indicate that intracellularly the chaperones from the two species differ
