crystal structure of the passenger domain of the escherichia coli autotransporter espp
autotransporters represent a large superfamily of known and putative virulence factors produced by gram negative bacteria they consist of an n terminal  passenger domain  responsible for the specific effector functions of the molecule and a c terminal    domain  responsible for translocation of the passenger across the bacterial outer membrane here we present the    crystal structure of the passenger domain of the extracellular serine protease espp produced by the pathogen escherichia coli o  h and a member of the serine protease autotransporters of enterobacteriaceae spates  like the previously structurally characterized spate passenger domains the espp passenger domain contains an extended right handed parallel  helix preceded by an n terminal globular domain housing the catalytic function of the protease of note however is the absence of a second globular domain protruding from this  helix we describe the structure of the espp passenger domain in the context of previous results and provide an alternative hypothesis for the function of the  helix within spates
