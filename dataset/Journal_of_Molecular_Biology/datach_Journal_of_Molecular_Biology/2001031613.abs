using chimeric immunity proteins to explore the energy landscape for  helical protein folding edited by j thornton
to address the role of sequence in the folding of homologous proteins the folding and unfolding kinetics of the all helical bacterial immunity proteins im and im were characterised together with six chimeric derivatives of these proteins we show that both im and im fold rapidly kunh o     s   at ph     c in apparent two state transitions through rate limiting transition states that are highly compact  ts   and    respectively  whilst the folding and unfolding properties of three of the chimeras im     im  im     im and im      im  are similar to their parental counterparts in other chimeric proteins the introduced sequence variation results in altered kinetic behaviour at low urea concentrations im     im and im      im fold in two state transitions via transition states that are significantly less compact  ts     than those characterised for the other immunity proteins presented here at higher urea concentrations however the rate limiting transition state for these two chimeras switches or moves to a more compact species  ts      surprisingly im      im populates a highly collapsed species  i     in the dead time   ms of stopped flow measurements these data indicate that whilst topology may place significant constraints on the folding process specific inter residue interactions revealed here through multiple sequence changes can modulate the ruggedness of the folding energy landscape
