analysis of binding site hot spots on the surface of ras gtpase
we have recently discovered an allosteric switch in ras bringing an additional level of complexity to this gtpase whose mutants are involved in nearly   of cancers upon activation of the allosteric switch there is a shift in helix  loop  associated with a disorder to order transition in the active site here we use a combination of multiple solvent crystal structures and computational solvent mapping ftmap to determine binding site hot spots in the  off  and  on  allosteric states of the gtp bound form of h ras thirteen sites are revealed expanding possible target sites for ligand binding well beyond the active site comparison of ftmaps for the h and k isoforms reveals essentially identical hot spots furthermore using nmr measurements of spin relaxation we determined that k ras exhibits global conformational dynamics very similar to those we previously reported for h ras we thus hypothesize that the global conformational rearrangement serves as a mechanism for allosteric coupling between the effector interface and remote hot spots in all ras isoforms at least with respect to the binding sites involving the g domain h ras is an excellent model for k ras and probably n ras as well ras has so far been elusive as a target for drug design the present work identifies various unexplored hot spots throughout the entire surface of ras extending the focus from the disordered active site to well ordered locations that should be easier to target
