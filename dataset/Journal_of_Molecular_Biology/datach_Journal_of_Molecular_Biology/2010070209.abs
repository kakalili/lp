structural and biochemical characterization of a halophilic archaeal alkaline phosphatase
phosphate is an essential component of all cells that must be taken up from the environment prokaryotes commonly secrete alkaline phosphatases aps to recruit phosphate from organic compounds by hydrolysis in this study the ap from halobacterium salinarum an archaeon that lives in a saturated salt environment has been functionally and structurally characterized the core fold and the active site architecture of the h salinarum enzyme are similar to other ap structures these generally form dimers composed of dominant  sheet structures sandwiched by  helices and have well accessible active sites the surface of the enzyme is predicted to be highly negatively charged like other proteins of extreme halophiles in addition to the conserved core most aps contain a crown domain that strongly varies within species in the h salinarum ap the crown domain is made of an acyl carrier protein like fold different from other aps it is not involved in dimer formation we compare the archaeal ap with its bacterial and eukaryotic counterparts and we focus on the role of crown domains in enhancing protein stability regulating enzyme function and guiding phosphoesters into the active site funnel
