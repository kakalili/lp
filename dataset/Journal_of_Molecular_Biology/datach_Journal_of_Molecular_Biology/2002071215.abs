atomic structures of human dihydrofolate reductase complexed with nadph and two lipophilic antifolates at    and    resolution
the crystal structures of two human dihydrofolate reductase hdhfr ternary complexes each with bound nadph cofactor and a lipophilic antifolate inhibitor have been determined at atomic resolution the potent inhibitors    quinolylamino methyl   diamino  methylpyrido   d pyrimidine sri    and z      dimethoxyphenyl ethen  yl   diamino  methylpyrido   d pyrimidine sri    were developed at southern research institute against toxoplasma gondii dhfr thymidylate synthase the  deazapteridine ring of each inhibitor adopts an unusual puckered conformation that enables the formation of identical contacts in the active site conversely the quinoline and dimethoxybenzene moieties exhibit distinct binding characteristics that account for the differences in inhibitory activity in both structures a salt bridge is formed between arg  in the active site and glu  from a symmetry related molecule in the crystal lattice that mimics the binding of methotrexate to dhfr
