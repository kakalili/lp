dna induced partial unfolding of prion protein leads to its polymerisation to amyloid
the full length mouse recombinant prion protein      amino acid residues contains all of its structural elements viz three  helices and a short two stranded antiparallel  sheet in its c terminal fragment comprising      amino acid residues the incubated mixture of this prion protein fragment and nucleic acid results in the formation of amyloid fibres evidenced from electron microscopy birefringence and fluorescence of the fibre bound congo red and thioflavin t dyes respectively the secondary structure of the amyloid formed in nucleic acid solution is similar to the in vivo isolated prion protein    amyloid but unlike in it a hydrophobic milieu is absent in the     amyloid thermal denaturation study demonstrates a partial unfolding of the protein fragment in nucleic acid solution we propose that nucleic acid catalyses unfolding of prion protein helix  followed by a nucleation dependent polymerisation of the protein to amyloid
