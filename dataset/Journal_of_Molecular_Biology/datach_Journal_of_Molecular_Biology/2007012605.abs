ligand regulated peptide aptamers that inhibit the   amp activated protein kinase
in an effort to extend the peptide aptamer approach we have developed a scaffold protein that allows small molecule ligand control over the presentation of a peptide aptamer this scaffold a fusion of three protein domains fkbp  frb and gst presents a peptide linker region for target protein binding only in the absence of the small molecule rapamycin or other non immunosuppressive rapamycin derivatives here we describe the characterization of ligand regulated peptide aptamers that interact with and inhibit the   amp activated protein kinase ampk  ampk a central regulator of cellular energy homeostasis responds to high cellular amp atp ratios by promoting energy producing pathways and inhibiting energy consuming biosynthetic pathways we have characterized  lirps of similar poly basic sequence and have determined that they interact with the substrate peptide binding region of both ampk   and   these proteins some of which serve as poor substrates of ampk inhibit the kinase as pseudosubstrates in a rapamycin regulated fashion in vitro an effect that is largely competitive with substrate peptide and mediated by an increase in the kinase s apparent km for substrate peptide this pseudosubstrate inhibition of ampk by lirp proteins reduced the amp stimulation of ampk in vitro and caused the inhibited state of the kinase to kinetically resemble the basal unstimulated state of ampk providing potential insight into the molecular mechanisms of amp stimulation of ampk
