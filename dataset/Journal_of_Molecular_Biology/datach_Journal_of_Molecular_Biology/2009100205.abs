prediction of protein  protein interfaces on g protein  subunits reveals a novel phospholipase c   binding domain
g  subunits from heterotrimeric g proteins guanine nucleotide binding proteins directly bind diverse proteins including effectors and regulators to modulate a wide array of signaling cascades these numerous interactions constrained the evolution of the molecular surface of g  although mammals contain five g  genes comprising two classes g  like and g  like  plants and fungi have a single ortholog and organisms such as caenorhabditis elegans and drosophila melanogaster contain one copy from each class a limited number of crystal structures of complexes containing g  subunits and complementary biochemical data highlight specific sites within g s needed for protein interactions it is difficult to determine from these interaction sites what if any additional regions of the g  molecular surface comprise interaction interfaces essential to g  s role as a nexus in numerous signaling cascades we used a comparative evolutionary approach to identify five known and eight previously unknown putative interfaces on the surface of g  we show that one such novel interface occurs between g  and phospholipase c   plc    a mammalian g  interacting protein substitutions of residues within this g   plc   interface reduce the activation of plc   by g   confirming that our de novo comparative evolutionary approach predicts previously unknown g   protein interfaces similarly we hypothesize that the seven remaining untested novel regions contribute to putative interfaces for other g  interacting proteins finally this comparative evolutionary approach is suitable for application to any protein involved in a significant number of protein  protein interactions
