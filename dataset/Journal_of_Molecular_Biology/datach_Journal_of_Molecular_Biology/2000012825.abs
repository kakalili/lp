selection of amino acid substitutions restoring activity of hiv  integrase mutated in its catalytic site using the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae edited by m yaniv
the integration of proviral dna into the genome of the host cell is an essential step in the replication of retroviruses this reaction is catalyzed by a viral encoded enzyme the integrase in  we have previously shown that human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  in causes a lethal effect when expressed in yeast cells this system called yeast lethal assay was used as a tool to study in activity in a cellular context the yeast lethal assay allowed the selection and characterization of mutations affecting both the lethal phenotype and the in vitro in activities in mutants were produced by random pcr mutagenesis in an in gene bearing the inactivating d  a mutation in the catalytic site the corresponding d  a substituted in does not lead to lethality in yeast subsequent selection of mutants able to restore the lethal effect of in was carried out using the yeast lethal assay we isolated three mutants presenting a restored phenotype the mutated in genes were sequenced and the corresponding proteins were purified to characterize their in vitro activities the three mutants presented restoration of the in vitro strand transfer activity while   processing was only partially restored the three mutants differ from d  a in by at least one amino acid substitution located in the n terminal domain of the protein outside of the active site these new mutated hiv  ins may therefore allow a better understanding of the n terminal domain function in the integration reaction in addition these results support our hypothesis that explains the lethal effect as a consequence of the nuclear damage caused by wild type in in yeast cells these data also indicate that the yeast lethal assay can be used as a tool to study the retroviral integration mechanism in a cellular context and to select specific inhibitors
