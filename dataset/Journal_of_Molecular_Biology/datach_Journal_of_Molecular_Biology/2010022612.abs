molecular determinants required for selective interactions between the thyroid hormone receptor homodimer and the nuclear receptor corepressor n cor
the unliganded nuclear receptor nr generally recruits the nr corepressor n cor and the silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor via its direct binding to the extended helical motif within dual nr interaction domains ids of corepressors interestingly n cor has a third id id  upstream of two ids id and id  and its core motif idvii  rather than an extended helical motif is known to be involved directly in the exclusive interaction of id with the thyroid hormone receptor tr  here we investigated the molecular determinants of the tr interaction with id to understand the molecular basis of the n cor preference shown by the tr homodimer using a one plus two hybrid system we identified the specific residues of n cor id and n cor id that are required for stable association of n cor with the tr homodimer by swapping experiments and mutagenesis studies we found that the c terminally flanked residues of the core motif of id contribute to the tr preference for n cor id  suggesting that an extended three turn helix might form within the id via a c terminal extension idviitrqi and participate directly in the tr specific interaction structural modeling of the id motif on tr lbd is consistent with this conclusion notably we identified a novel interaction between n cor id and orphan nr reverb that is mediated by the residues crucial also in tr binding these observations raise the intriguing possibility that nr homodimers such as tr and reverb display preferential binding to the n cor corepressor via their specific interactions with id  which is normally absent from the silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor
