peptide epitope identification by affinity selection on bacteriophage ms virus like particles
filamentous phages are now the most widely used vehicles for phage display and provide efficient means for epitope identification however the peptides they display are not very immunogenic because they normally fail to present foreign epitopes at the very high densities required for efficient b cell activation meanwhile systems based on virus like particles vlps permit the engineered high density display of specific epitopes but are incapable of peptide library display and affinity selection we developed a new peptide display platform based on vlps of the rna bacteriophage ms  it combines the high immunogenicity of ms vlps with the affinity selection capabilities of other phage display systems here we describe plasmid vectors that facilitate the construction of high complexity random sequence peptide libraries on ms vlps and that allow control of the stringency of affinity selection through the manipulation of display valency we used the system to identify epitopes for several previously characterized monoclonal antibody targets and showed that the vlps thus obtained elicit antibodies in mice whose activities mimic those of the selecting antibodies
