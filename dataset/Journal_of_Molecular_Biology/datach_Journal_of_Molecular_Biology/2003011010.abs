genomic structure and functional characterisation of the promoters of human and mouse nogo rtn
the reticulon family member nogo a is a potent neurite growth inhibitory protein in vitro and may play a role in the restriction of axonal regeneration after injury and of structural plasticity in the cns of higher vertebrates of the three major isoforms of nogo nogo a is mostly expressed in the brain nogo b is found in a ubiquitous pattern and nogo c is most highly expressed in muscle seven additional splice variants derived both from differential splicing and differential promoter usage have been identified analysis of the tata less nogo a b promoter p  shows that conserved gc boxes and a ccaat box within the first  bp upstream of the transcription start are responsible for its regulation no major differences in the methylation status of the p cpg island in tissues expressing or not expressing nogo a b could be detected suggesting that silencer elements are involved in the regulation the specific expression pattern of nogo a b is due to differential splicing the basal nogo c promoter p  is regulated by a proximal and a distal element the   utr of nogo c harbours a negative control element these data may help to identify factors that can modulate nogo transcription thus offering an alternative approach for nogo neutralisation
