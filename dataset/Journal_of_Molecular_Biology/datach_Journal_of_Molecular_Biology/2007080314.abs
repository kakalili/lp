isw acts independently of the isw a and isw b complexes in regulating transcriptional silencing at the ribosomal dna locus in saccharomyces cerevisiae
transcriptional silencing of pol ii transcribed genes in saccharomyces cerevisiae occurs at the hm loci telomeres and ribosomal dna rdna locus gene silencing at these loci requires histone modifying enzymes as well as factors that regulate local chromatin structure previous work has shown that the atp dependent chromatin remodeling protein isw is required for silencing of a marker gene inserted at the hmr locus but not at telomeres here we show that isw is required for transcriptional silencing of pol ii transcribed genes in the ribosomal dna locus our results indicate that isw associates with the rdna and that this interaction is not altered in cells lacking other members of the isw a and isw b chromatin remodeling complexes further the association of isw with the rdna is not altered in cells lacking the histone deacetylase sir or the histone methyltransferase set  two factors that are required for gene silencing at the rdna notably the loss of transcriptional silencing at the rdna in cells lacking isw is correlated with a change in rdna chromatin structure together our data support a model in which isw acts independently of the previously characterized isw a and isw b complexes to maintain a heterochromatin like structure at the rdna that is required for gene silencing
