identification of nucleophosmin b  an acidic nucleolar protein as a stimulatory factor for in vitro replication of adenovirus dna complexed with viral basic core proteins edited by t richmond
the processes governing chromatin remodeling and assembly which occur prior to and or after transcription and replication are not completely understood to understand the mechanisms of transcription and replication from chromatin templates we have established in vitro replication and transcription systems using adenovirus ad dna complexed with viral basic core proteins called ad core as a template using this system we have previously identified from hela cells template activating factor i as a stimulatory factor for the ad core dna replication here using this system as a tool we identified and purified a novel template activating factor activity that consists of two acidic polypeptides whose apparent molecular masses are  kda and  kda these two polypeptides correspond to two splicing variants of nucleolar phosphoprotein nucleophosmin b  recombinant b  proteins stimulate the ad core dna replication and the acidic regions of b  proteins are important for its activity in addition b  proteins directly bind to core histones and transfer them to naked dna furthermore chromatin components such as histones and topoisomerase ii are co immunoprecipitated with b  from cell extracts these observations lead to a hypothesis that nucleophosmin b  is involved in structural changes of chromatin thereby regulating transcription and replication within the ribosomal dna region or maintaining the nucleolar structure
