The methodology for generating a homology model of the T1 TCR-PbCS-Kd class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I complex is presented. The resulting model provides a qualitative explanation of the effect of over 50 different mutations in the region of the complementarity determining region (CDR) loops of the T cell receptor (TCR), the peptide and the MHC’s α1/α2 helices. The peptide is modified by an azido benzoic acid photoreactive group, which is part of the epitope recognized by the TCR. The construction of the model makes use of closely related homologs (the A6 TCR-Tax-HLA A2 complex, the 2C TCR, the 14.3.d TCR Vβ chain, the 1934.4 TCR Vα chain, and the H-2 Kb-ovalbumine peptide), ab initio sampling of CDR loops conformations and experimental data to select from the set of possibilities. The model shows a complex arrangement of the CDR3α, CDR1β, CDR2β and CDR3β loops that leads to the highly specific recognition of the photoreactive group. The protocol can be applied systematically to a series of related sequences, permitting the analysis at the structural level of the large TCR repertoire specific for a given peptide-MHC complex.
