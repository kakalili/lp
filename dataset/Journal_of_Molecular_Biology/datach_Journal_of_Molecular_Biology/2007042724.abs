the acylaminoacyl peptidase from aeropyrum pernix k thought to be an exopeptidase displays endopeptidase activity
mammalian acylaminoacyl peptidase a member of the prolyl oligopeptidase family of serine peptidases is an exopeptidase which removes acylated amino acid residues from the n terminus of oligopeptides we have investigated the kinetics and inhibitor binding of the orthologous acylaminoacyl peptidase from the thermophile aeropyrum pernix k  apaap  complex ph rate profiles were found with charged substrates indicating a strong electrostatic effect in the surroundings of the active site unexpectedly we have found that oligopeptides can be hydrolysed beyond the n terminal peptide bond demonstrating that apaap exhibits endopeptidase activity it was thought that the enzyme is specific for hydrophobic amino acids in particular phenylalanine in accord with the non polar s subsite of apaap however cleavage after an ala residue contradicted this notion and demonstrated that p residues of different nature may bind to the s subsite depending on the remaining peptide residues the crystal structures of the complexes formed between the enzyme and product like inhibitors identified the oxyanion binding site unambiguously and demonstrated that the phenylalanine ring of the p peptide residue assumes a position different from that established in a previous study using  nitrophenylphosphate we have found that the substrate binding site extends beyond the s subsite being capable of binding peptides with a longer n terminus the s subsite displays a non polar character which is unique among the enzymes of this family the s site was identified as a hydrophobic region that does not form hydrogen bonds with the inhibitor p residue the enzyme  inhibitor complexes revealed that upon ligand binding the s subsite undergoes significant conformational changes demonstrating the plasticity of the specificity site
