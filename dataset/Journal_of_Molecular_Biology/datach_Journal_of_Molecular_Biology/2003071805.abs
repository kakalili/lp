contribution of opening and bending dynamics to specific recognition of dna damage
guanine uracil g u wobble base pairs are a detrimental lesion in dna previous investigations have shown that such wobble base pairs are more prone to base opening than the normal g c base pairs to investigate the sequence dependence of base pair opening we have performed ns molecular dynamics simulations on g u wobble base pairs in two different sequence contexts tgt aua and cgc gug furthermore we have investigated the effect of replacing the guanine base in each sequence with a fluorescent guanine analogue  methylisoxanthopterin  mi  our results indicate that each sequence opens spontaneously towards the major groove in the course of the simulations the tgt aua sequence has a greater proportion of structures in the open state than the cgc gug sequence incorporation of mi yields wobble base pairs that open more readily than their guanine counterparts in order of increasing open population the sequences are ordered as cgc lt tgt lt cmc lt tmt where m represents mi both members of the base pair open towards the major groove in a symmetrically coupled motion opening results in breakage of the h u  o g mi hydrogen bond and distortion of the h g mi  o u hydrogen bond structural consequences of the opening include the formation of the h  g mi  o u hydrogen bond and a change in local solvation in the grooves and particularly near n  h of uracil additionally dna flexibility is reduced in the open state for bending towards the major groove generating two nearly discrete states closed unbent and open bent the observed differences in the local structural and dynamical properties of the g u base pair may play an important role in the activity of dna repair enzymes that initiate base excision by distorting the dna and flipping the target base from inside the dna helix
