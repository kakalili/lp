slow amyloid nucleation via  helix rich oligomeric intermediates in short polyglutamine containing huntingtin fragments
the  amino acid n terminal segment httnt that leads into the polyglutamine polyq segment in the huntington s disease protein huntingtin htt dramatically increases aggregation rates and changes the aggregation mechanism compared to a simple polyq peptide of similar length with polyq segments near or above the pathological repeat length threshold of about   aggregation of htt n terminal fragments is so rapid that it is difficult to tease out mechanistic details we describe here the use of very short polyq repeat lengths in htt n terminal fragments to slow this disease associated aggregation although all of these peptides in addition to httnt itself form  helix rich oligomeric intermediates only peptides with qn of eight or longer mature into amyloid like aggregates doing so by a slow increase in  structure concentration dependent circular dichroism and analytical ultracentrifugation suggest that the httnt sequence with or without added glutamine residues exists in solution as an equilibrium between disordered monomer and  helical tetramer higher order   helix rich oligomers appear to be built up via these tetramers however only httntqn peptides with n  or more undergo conversion into polyq  sheet aggregates these final amyloid like aggregates not only feature the expected high  sheet content but also retain an element of solvent exposed  helix the  helix rich oligomeric intermediates appear to be both on and off pathway with some oligomers serving as the pool from within which nuclei emerge while those that fail to undergo amyloid nucleation serve as a reservoir for release of monomers to support fibril elongation based on a regular pattern of multimers observed in analytical ultracentrifugation and a concentration dependence of  helix formation in cd spectroscopy it is likely that these oligomers assemble via a four helix assembly unit polyq expansion in these peptides appears to enhance the rates of both oligomer formation and nucleation from within the oligomer population by structural mechanisms that remain unclear
