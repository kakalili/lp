globular tetramers of   microglobulin assemble into elaborate amyloid fibrils
amyloid fibrils are ordered polymers in which constituent polypeptides adopt a non native fold despite their importance in degenerative human diseases the overall structure of amyloid fibrils remains unknown high resolution studies of model peptide assemblies have identified residues forming cross  strands and have revealed some details of local  strand packing however little is known about the assembly contacts that define the fibril architecture here we present a set of three dimensional structures of amyloid fibrils formed from full length   microglobulin a  residue protein involved in clinical amyloidosis our cryo electron microscopy maps reveal a hierarchical fibril structure built from tetrameric units of globular density with at least three different subunit interfaces in this homopolymeric assembly these findings suggest a more complex superstructure for amyloid than hitherto suspected and prompt a re evaluation of the defining features of the amyloid fold
