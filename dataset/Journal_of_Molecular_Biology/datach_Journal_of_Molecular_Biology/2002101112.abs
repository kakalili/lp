a structure based interpretation of e coli grpe thermodynamic properties
grpe is the nucleotide exchange factor for the escherichia coli molecular chaperone dnak the prokaryotic homologue of hsp  thermodynamic properties of grpe structural domains were characterized by examining a number of structural and point mutants using circular dichroism differential scanning calorimetry and analytical ultracentrifugation these structural domains are the long paired n terminal helices the central four helix bundle and the c terminal compact beta domains we show that the central four helix bundle tm    c provides a stable platform for the association of the long paired n terminal helices tm    c  which can then function as a temperature sensor the stability of the n terminal helices is linked to the presence of the c terminal compact beta domains of grpe providing a potential mechanism for coupling of dnak binding activity of grpe with temperature on the basis of our thermodynamic analysis of e coli grpe we present a structure based model for the melting properties of the nucleotide exchange factor wherein the long paired helices function as a molecular thermocouple
