interactions of yeast ribosomal protein rps  with rna
yeast ribosomal protein s  rps  binds to two different rna molecules   helix  of  s rrna during its assembly into  s ribosomal subunits and   a stem loop structure in rps b pre mrna to repress expression of the rps b gene we used the three dimensional structure of thermus thermophilus ribosomal protein s  a bacterial homologue of rps  as a guide to identify conserved surface exposed amino acid residues that are likely to contact rna eight residues that met these criteria were mutated to alanine most of these mutations affected interaction of rps  with either helix  or the rps b stem loop rna or both assembly of  s ribosomal subunits and repression of rps b were also affected s  contains an extended carboxy terminal domain rich in basic amino acids which interacts with rrna we systematically evaluated the importance of each of the last ten amino acid residues in the basic carboxy terminal tail of yeast rps  for binding to rna by mutating each to alanine mutations in nine of these residues decreased binding of rps  to one or both of its rna ligands in addition we examined the importance of four structural motifs in helix  of  s rrna for binding to rps  mutations that altered either the terminal loop the g u base pair closing the terminal loop or the internal loop affected binding of rps  to helix
