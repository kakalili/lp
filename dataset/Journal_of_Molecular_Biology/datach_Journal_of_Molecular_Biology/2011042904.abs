investigations on the c q  calreticulin  phosphatidylserine interactions yield new insights into apoptotic cell recognition
both c q and calreticulin crt are involved in the recognition of apoptotic cells crt was initially characterized as a receptor for the c q collagen like fragment clf  whereas c q was shown to bind apoptotic cells through its globular region gr  using purified crt and recombinant crt domains we now provide unambiguous experimental evidence that in addition to its clf the c q gr also binds crt and that both types of interactions are mediated by the crt globular domain surface plasmon resonance analyses revealed that the c q clf and gr domains each bind individually to immobilized crt and its globular domain with kd values of           m further evidence that crt binds to the c q gr was obtained by electron microscopy the role of crt in the recognition of apoptotic hela cells by c q was analyzed the c q gr partially colocalized with crt on the surface of early apoptotic cells and sirna small interfering rna induced crt deficiency resulted in increased apoptotic cell binding to c q the interaction between crt and phosphatidylserine ps  a known c q ligand on apoptotic cells was also investigated the polar head of ps was shown to bind to crt with a  fold higher affinity kd       m than that determined for c q and accordingly the c q gr  ps interaction was impaired in the presence of crt together these observations indicate that crt c q and ps are all closely involved in the uptake of apoptotic cells and strongly suggest a combinatorial role of these three molecules in the recognition step
