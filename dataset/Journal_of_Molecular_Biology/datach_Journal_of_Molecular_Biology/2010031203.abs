role of the adenine ligand on the stabilization of the secondary and tertiary interactions in the adenine riboswitch
riboswitches are rna based genetic control elements that function via a conformational transition mechanism when a specific target molecule binds to its binding pocket to facilitate an atomic detail interpretation of experimental investigations on the role of the adenine ligand on the conformational properties and kinetics of folding of the add adenine riboswitch we performed molecular dynamics simulations in both the presence and the absence of the ligand in the absence of ligand structural deviations were observed in the j  junction and the p stem destabilization of the p stem in the absence of ligand involves the loss of direct stabilizing interactions with the ligand with additional contributions from the j  junction region the j  junction of the riboswitch is found to be more flexible and the tertiary contacts among the junction regions are altered in the absence of the adenine ligand results suggest that the adenine ligand associates and dissociates from the riboswitch in the vicinity of j  good agreement was obtained with the experimental data with the results indicating dynamic behavior of the adenine ligand on the nanosecond time scale to be associated with the dynamic behavior of hydrogen bonding with the riboswitch results also predict that direct interactions of the adenine ligand with u  of the riboswitch are not essential for stable binding although it is crucial for its recognition the possibility of methodological artifacts and force field inaccuracies impacting the present observations was checked by additional molecular dynamics simulations in the presence of   diaminopurine and in the crystal environment
