the role of kinesin neck linker and neck in velocity regulation
despite the high level of similarity in structural organisation of their motor domains and consequently in the mechanism of motility generation kinesin  moves about  fold slower than conventional kinesin kinesin   to elucidate the structural motifs contributing to velocity regulation we expressed a set of eg  and kif a based chimeric proteins with interchanged native neck linker and neck elements among them the chimera consisting of the eg catalytic core residues     fused to the kif a linker and neck residues      displayed increased velocity compared to the eg control protein this is the first evidence that the velocity of the slow moving motor eg can be elevated by insertion of neck linker and neck elements taken from a fast moving motor whereas the complementary chimera composed of the kif a core      and the eg linker and neck       was found to be immotile insertion of the first half kif a linker into this chimera restored motility our results indicate that the neck linker and the neck are involved not only in motility generation in general and in determination of movement direction but also in velocity regulation
