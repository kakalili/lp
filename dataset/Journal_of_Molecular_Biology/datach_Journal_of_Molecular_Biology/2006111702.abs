localization of prefoldin interaction sites in the hyperthermophilic group ii chaperonin and correlations between binding rate and protein transfer rate
prefoldin is a molecular chaperone that captures a protein folding intermediate and transfers it to a group ii chaperonin for correct folding the manner by which prefoldin interacts with a group ii chaperonin is poorly understood here we have examined the prefoldin interaction site in the archaeal group ii chaperonin comparing the interaction of two thermococcus chaperonins and their mutants with pyrococcus prefoldin by surface plasmon resonance we show that the mutations of lys  and lys  of thermococcus  chaperonin residues to glu residues increase the affinity to pyrococcus prefoldin to the level of thermococcus  chaperonin and pyrococcus chaperonin indicating that their glu  and glu  residues of the helical protrusion region are responsible for relatively stronger binding to pyrococcus prefoldin than thermococcus  chaperonin since the putative chaperonin binding sites in the distal ends of pyrococcus prefoldin are rich in basic residues electrostatic interaction seems to be important for their interaction the substrate protein transfer rate from prefoldin correlates well with its affinity for chaperonin
