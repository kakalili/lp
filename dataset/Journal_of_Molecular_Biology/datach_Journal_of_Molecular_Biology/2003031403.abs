chromatin fiber folding requirement for the histone h n terminal tail
we have developed a self assembly system for nucleosome arrays in which recombinant post translationally unmodified histone proteins are combined with dna of defined sequence to form chromatin higher order structure the nucleosome arrays obtained are highly homogeneous and sediment at  s when maximally folded in mm or  mm mgcl  the folding properties are comparable to established systems analytical ultracentrifugation is used to determine the consequence of individual histone tail domain deletions on array folding fully compacted chromatin fibers are obtained with any one of the histone tails deleted with the exception of the h n terminus the region of the h tail which mediates compaction resides in the stretch of amino acids
