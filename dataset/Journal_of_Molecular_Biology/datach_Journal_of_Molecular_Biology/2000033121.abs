plasminogen activator inhibitor  structure of the native serpin comparison to its other conformers and implications for serpin inactivation edited by r huber
the crystal structure of a constitutively active multiple site mutant of plasminogen activator inhibitor  pai  was determined and refined at a resolution of    the present structure comprises a dimer of two crystallographically independent pai  molecules that pack by association of the residues p to p of the reactive centre loop of one molecule a with the edge of the main  sheet a of the other molecule b thus the reactive centre loop is ordered for molecule a by crystal packing forces while for molecule b it is unconstrained by crystal packing contacts and is disordered the overall structure of active pai  is similar to the structures of other active inhibitory serpins exhibiting as the major secondary structural feature a five stranded  sheet a and an intact proteinase binding loop protruding from the one end of the elongated molecule no preinsertion of the reactive centre loop is observed in this structure a comparison of the present structure with the previously determined crystal structures of pai  in its alternative conformations reveals that upon cleavage of an intact form of pai  or formation of latent pai  the well characterised rearrangements of the serpin secondary structural elements are accompanied by dramatic and partly unexpected conformational changes of helical and loop structures proximal to  sheet a the present structure explains the stabilising effects of the mutated residues reveals the structural cause for the observed spectroscopic differences between active and latent pai  and provides new insights into possible mechanisms of stabilisation by its natural binding partner vitronectin
