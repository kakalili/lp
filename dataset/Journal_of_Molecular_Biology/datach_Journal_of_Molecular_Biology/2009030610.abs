a structural rationale for selective stabilization of anti tumor interactions of    proteins by cotylenin a
cotylenin a a fungal metabolite originally described as a cytokinin like bioactive substance against plants shows differentiation inducing and anti tumor activity in certain human cancers here we present the crystal structure of cotylenin a acting on a    regulatory protein complex by comparison with the closely related but non anticancer agent fusicoccin a a rationale for the activity of cotylenin a in human cancers is presented this class of fusicoccane diterpenoids are possible general modulators of    protein  protein interactions in this regard specificities for individual    target protein complexes might be achieved by varying the substituent pattern of the diterpene ring system as the different activities of fusicoccin a and cotylenin a in human cancers suggest hydroxylation of c  might be a sufficient determinant of structural specificity
