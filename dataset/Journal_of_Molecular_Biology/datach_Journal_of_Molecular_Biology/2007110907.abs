mechanism and functional significance of itk autophosphorylation
tec family non receptor tyrosine kinases itk btk tec rlk and bmx are characterized by the presence of an autophosphorylation site within the non catalytic src homology  sh  domain the full length itk mutant containing phenylalanine in place of the autophosphorylated tyrosine has been studied in itk deficient primary t cells these studies revealed that the non phosphorylated enzyme restores itk mediated signaling only partially in spite of these insights the precise role of the tec kinase autophosphorylation site is unclear and the mechanism of the autophosphorylation reaction within the tec kinases is not known here we show both in vitro and in vivo that itk autophosphorylation on y  within the sh domain occurs exclusively via an intramolecular in cis mechanism using an in vitro kinase assay we show that mutation of the itk autophosphorylation site y  to phe decreases kinase activity of the full length enzyme by increasing km for a peptide substrate moreover mutation of y  to glu a residue chosen to mimic the phosphorylated tyrosine alters the ligand binding capability of the itk sh domain in a ligand dependent fashion nmr chemical shift mapping gives residue specific structural insight into the effect of the y  e mutation on ligand binding these data provide a molecular level context with which to interpret in vivo functional data and allow development of a structural model for itk autophosphorylation
