the crystal structure of the human s  a s  a  heterotetramer calprotectin illustrates how conformational changes of interacting  helices can determine specific association of two ef hand proteins
the ef hand proteins s  a and s  a are important calcium signalling proteins that are involved in wound healing and provide clinically relevant markers of inflammatory processes such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease both can form homodimers via distinct modes of association probably of lesser stability in the case of s  a  whereas in the presence of calcium s  a and s  a associate to calprotectin the physiologically active heterooligomer here we describe the crystal structure of the s  a s  a  heterotetramer at     resolution its quaternary structure illustrates how specific heteroassociation is energetically driven by a more extensive burial of solvent accessible surface areas in both proteins most pronounced for s  a  thus leading to a dimer of heterodimers a major contribution to tetramer association is made by the canonical calcium binding loops in the c terminal halves of the two proteins the mode of heterodimerisation in calprotectin more closely resembles the subunit association previously observed in the s  a homodimer and provides trans stabilisation for s  a  which manifests itself in a significantly elongated c terminal  helix in the latter as a consequence two different putative zinc binding sites emerge at the s  a s  a subunit interface one of these corresponds to a high affinity arrangement of three his residues and one asp side chain which is unique to the heterotetramer this structural feature explains the well known zn  binding activity of calprotectin whose overexpression can cause strong dysregulation of zinc homeostasis with severe clinical symptoms
