binding site differences revealed by crystal structures of plasmodium falciparum and bovine acyl coa binding protein edited by r huber
acyl coa binding protein acbp maintains a pool of fatty acyl coa molecules in the cell and plays a role in fatty acid metabolism the biochemical properties of plasmodium falciparum acbp are described together with the    resolution crystal structures of a p falciparum acbp acyl coa complex and of bovine acbp in two crystal forms overall the bovine acbp crystal structures are similar to the nmr structures published previously however the bovine and parasite acbp structures are less similar the parasite acbp is shown to have a different ligand binding pocket leading to an acyl coa binding specificity different from that of bovine acbp several non conservative differences in residues that interact with the ligand were identified between the mammalian and parasite acbps these together with measured binding specificity differences suggest that there is a potential for the design of molecules that might selectively block the acyl coa binding site
