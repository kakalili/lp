structural basis of the interaction of the breast cancer oncogene lmo with the tumour suppressor ctip rbbp
lim only protein  lmo  is strongly linked to the progression of breast cancer although the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not well understood a role is emerging for lmo in regulation of the cell cycle we determined the solution structure of lmo in complex with ctip c terminal binding protein interacting protein rbbp  a tumour suppressor protein that is involved in cell cycle progression dna repair and transcriptional regulation our data reveal that ctip and the essential lmo cofactor ldb  lim domain binding protein  bind to the same face on lmo and cannot simultaneously bind to lmo  we hypothesise that overexpression of lmo may disrupt some of the normal tumour suppressor activities of ctip thereby contributing to breast cancer progression
