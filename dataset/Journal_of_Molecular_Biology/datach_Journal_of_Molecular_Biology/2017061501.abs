hnrnp a alters the structure of a conserved enterovirus ires domain to stimulate viral translation
enteroviruses use a type i internal ribosome entry site ires structure to facilitate protein synthesis and promote genome replication type i ires elements require auxiliary host proteins to organize rna structure for  s ribosomal subunit assembly heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein a stimulates enterovirus   ev  translation in part through specific interactions with its stem loop ii slii ires domain here we determined a conjoined nmr small angle x ray scattering structure of the ev  slii domain and a mutant that significantly attenuates viral replication by abrogating hnrnp a interactions native slii adopts a locally compact structure wherein stacking interactions in a conserved   auagc   bulge preorganize the adjacent helices at nearly orthogonal orientations mutating the bulge sequence to   acccc   ablates base stacking in the loop and globally reorients the slii structure biophysical titrations reveal that the   auagc   bulge undergoes a conformational change to assemble a functional hnrnp a  rna complex importantly ires mutations that delete the bulge impair viral translation and completely inhibit replication thus this work provides key details into how an ev  ires structure adapts to hijack a cellular protein and it suggests that the slii domain is a potential target for antiviral therapy
