allochromatium vinosum dsrc solution state nmr structure redox properties and interaction with dsrefh a protein essential for purple sulfur bacterial sulfur oxidation
sequenced genomes of dissimilatory sulfur oxidizing and sulfate reducing bacteria containing genes coding for dsrab the enzyme dissimilatory sulfite reductase inevitably also contain the gene coding for the  kda dsrc protein dsrc is thought to have a yet unidentified role associated with the activity of dsrab here we report the solution structure of dsrc from the sulfur oxidizing purple sulfur bacterium allochromatium vinosum determined with nmr spectroscopy in reducing conditions and we describe the redox behavior of two conserved cysteine residues upon transfer to an oxidizing environment in reducing conditions the dsrc structure is disordered in the highly conserved carboxy terminus we present multiple lines of evidence that in oxidizing conditions a strictly conserved cysteine cys   at the penultimate position in the sequence forms an intramolecular disulfide bond with cys   which is conserved in dsrc in all organisms with dsrab while an intermolecular cys  cys  disulfide bonded dimer is rapidly formed under oxidizing conditions the intramolecularly disulfide bonded species cys  cys   is the thermodynamically stable form of the protein under these conditions treatment of the disulfidic forms with reducing agent regenerates the monomeric species that was structurally characterized using a band shift technique under nondenaturing conditions we obtained evidence for the interaction of dsrc with heterohexameric dsrefh a protein encoded in the same operon mutation of cys  to serine prevented formation of the dsrc species assigned as an intramolecular disulfide in oxidizing conditions while still allowing formation of the intermolecular cys  cys  dimer in the reduced form this mutant protein still interacted with dsrefh this was not the case for the cys  ser and cys  ser cys  ser mutants both of which also did not form protein dimers our observations highlight the central importance of the carboxy terminal dsrc cysteine residues and are consistent with a role as a sulfur  substrate binding transferring protein as well as with an electron transfer function via thiol  disulfide interchanges
