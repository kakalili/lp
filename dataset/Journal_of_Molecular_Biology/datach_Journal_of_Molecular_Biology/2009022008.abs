m phase specific phosphorylation of histone h  at threonine  by gsk
h histones are progressively phosphorylated during the cell cycle the number of phosphorylated sites is zero to three in late s phase and increases to five or six in late g phase and m phase it is assumed that this phosphorylation modulates chromatin condensation and decondensation but its specific role remains unclear recently it was shown that the somatic h histone subtype h  becomes pentaphosphorylated during mitosis with phosphorylated threonine  being the last site to be phosphorylated we have generated an antiserum specific for human h  phosphorylated at threonine   immunofluorescence labeling of hela cells with this antiserum revealed that the phosphorylation at this site appears in prometaphase and disappears in telophase and that this hyperphosphorylated form of h  is mainly chromatin bound in metaphase when chromatin condensation is maximal in search of the kinase responsible for the phosphorylation at this site we found that threonine  of h  can be phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase  in vitro but not by cyclin dependent kinase  cyclin b and cyclin dependent kinase  p  respectively furthermore addition of specific glycogen synthase kinase  inhibitors led to a reduction in phosphorylation at this site both in vivo and in vitro
