human neuroserpin structure and time dependent inhibition
human neuroserpin hns is a protein serine protease inhibitor expressed mainly in the nervous system where it plays key roles in neural development and plasticity by primarily targeting tissue plasminogen activator tpa  four hns mutations are associated to a form of autosomal dominant dementia known as familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies the medical interest in and the lack of structural information on hns prompted us to study the crystal structure of native and cleaved hns reported here at   and     resolution respectively in the light of the three dimensional structures we focus on the hns reactive centre loop in its intact and cleaved conformations relative to the current serpin polymerization models and discuss the protein sites hosting neurodegenerative mutations on the basis of homologous serpin structures we suggest the location of a protein surface site that may stabilize the hns native metastable form in parallel we present the results of kinetic studies on hns inhibition of tpa our data analysis stresses the instability of the hns  tpa complex with a dissociation half life of minutes compared to a half life of weeks observed for other serpin  cognate protease complexes
