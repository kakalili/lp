insights into cleavage specificity from the crystal structure of foot and mouth disease virus c protease complexed with a peptide substrate
picornavirus replication is critically dependent on the correct processing of a polyprotein precursor by c protease s  cpro at multiple specific sites with related but non identical sequences to investigate the structural basis of its cleavage specificity we performed the first crystallographic structural analysis of non covalent complexes of a picornavirus cpro with peptide substrates the x ray crystal structure of the foot and mouth disease virus cpro mutated to replace the catalytic cys by ala and bound to a peptide apakq llnfd corresponding to the p  p   region of the vp  a cleavage junction in the viral polyprotein was determined up to     resolution comparison with free enzyme reveals significant conformational changes in cpro on substrate binding that lead to the formation of an extended interface of contact primarily involving the p  p   positions of the peptide strikingly the deep s   specificity pocket needed to accommodate p   leu only forms when the peptide binds substrate specificity was investigated using peptide cleavage assays to show the impact of amino acid substitutions within the p  p   region of synthetic substrates the structure of the enzyme  peptide complex explains the marked substrate preferences for particular p  p and p residue types as well as the relative promiscuity at p and on the p  side of the scissile bond furthermore crystallographic analysis of the complex with a modified vp  a peptide apake llnfd containing a gln to glu substitution reveals an identical mode of peptide binding and explains the ability of foot and mouth disease virus cpro to cleave sequences containing either p gln or p glu structure based mutagenesis was used to probe interactions within the s   specificity pocket and to provide direct evidence of the important contribution made by asp  of the cys his asp catalytic triad to proteolytic activity our results provide a new level of detail in our understanding of the structural basis of polyprotein cleavage by cpro
