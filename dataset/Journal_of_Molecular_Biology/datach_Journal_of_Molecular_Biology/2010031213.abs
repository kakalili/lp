assembly of a  nm protein cage by escherichia coli  hydroxypentadienoic acid hydratase
the pentameric escherichia coli enzyme  hydroxypentadienoic acid hydratase assembles to form a  nm diameter particle comprising  protein subunits arranged with   symmetry when crystallised at low ph in the presence of phosphate or sulphate ions the particles form rapidly and are stable in solution during gel filtration at low ph they are probably formed through trimers of pentamers which are stabilised by the interaction of two phosphate ions with residues of the n terminal domains of subunits at the  fold axis once the particles are formed at high concentrations of phosphate or sulphate  they remain stable in solution at  fold lower concentrations of the anion guest molecules can be trapped within the hollow protein shell during assembly the c termini of the subunits are freely accessible on the surface of the protein cage and thus are ideal sites for addition of affinity tags or other modifications these particles offer a convenient model system for studying the assembly of large symmetrical structures and a novel protein nanoparticle for encapsulation and cargo delivery
