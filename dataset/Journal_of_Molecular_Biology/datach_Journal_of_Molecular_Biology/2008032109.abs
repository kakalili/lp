cryo em structure of dodecameric vps p and its   complex with vta p
the type i aaa atpase associated with a variety of cellular activities atpase vps and its co factor vta p lip function in membrane remodeling events that accompany cytokinesis multivesicular body biogenesis and retrovirus budding apparently by driving disassembly and recycling of membrane associated escrt endosomal sorting complex required for transport iii complexes here we present electron cryomicroscopy reconstructions of dodecameric yeast vps p complexes with and without their microtubule interacting and transport mit n terminal domains and vta p co factors the atpase domains of vps p form a bowl like structure composed of stacked hexameric rings the two rings adopt dramatically different conformations with the  upper  ring forming an open assembly that defines the sides of the bowl and the lower ring forming a closed assembly that forms the bottom of the bowl the n terminal mit domains of the upper ring localize on the symmetry axis above the cavity of the bowl and the binding of six extended vta p monomers causes additional density to appear both above and below the bowl the structures suggest models in which vps p mit and vta p domains engage escrt iii substrates above the bowl and help transfer them into the bowl to be pumped through the center of the dodecameric assembly
