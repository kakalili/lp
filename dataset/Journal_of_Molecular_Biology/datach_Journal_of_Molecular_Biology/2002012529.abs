s proteasomes function as stable entities edited by r huber
most proteins in eukaryotic cells are degraded by  s proteasomes usually after being conjugated to ubiquitin in the absence of atp   s proteasomes fall apart into their two sub complexes   s proteasomes and pa   which reassemble upon addition of atp conceivably   s proteasomes dissociate and reassemble during initiation of protein degradation in a ternary complex with the substrate as in the dissociation reassembly cycles found for ribosomes and the chaperonin groel groes here we followed disassembly and assembly of  s proteasomes in cell extracts as the exchange of pa  subunits between mouse and human  s proteasomes compared to the rate of proteolysis in the same extract the disassembly reassembly cycle was much too slow to present an obligatory step in a degradation cycle it has been suggested that subunit s a mcb  rpn   which binds poly ubiquitin substrates shuttles between a free state and the  s proteasome bringing substrate to the complex however s a was not found in the free state in hela cells besides all subunits in pa   including s a exchanged at similar low rates it therefore seems that  s proteasomes function as stable entities during degradation of proteins
