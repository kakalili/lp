insight into catalysis of nitrous oxide reductase from high resolution structures of resting and inhibitor bound enzyme from achromobacter cycloclastes
the difficult chemistry of nitrous oxide n o reduction to gaseous nitrogen n  in biology is catalysed by the novel   sulphide bridged tetranuclear cuz cluster of the n o reductases n or  two spectroscopically distinct forms of this cluster have been identified as cuz and cuz  we have obtained a     resolution crystal structure of the pink purple species of n or from achromobacter cycloclastes acn or isolated under aerobic conditions this structure reveals a previously unobserved ligation with two oxygen atoms from h o oh  coordinated to cu and cu of the catalytic centre we ascribe this structure to be that of the cuz form of the cluster since the previously reported structures of two blue species of n ors also isolated aerobically have characterised the redox inactive cuz form revealing a single water molecule at cu  exposure of the as isolated acn or to sodium iodide led to reduction of the electron donating cua site and the formation of a blue species structure determination of this adduct at     resolution showed that iodide was bound at the cuz site bridging the cu and cu ions this structure represents the first observation of an inhibitor bound to the cu cu edge of the catalytic cluster providing clear evidence for this being the catalytic edge in n ors these structures together with the published structural and spectroscopic data give fresh insight into the mode of substrate binding reduction and catalysis
