patching broken dna nucleosome dynamics and the repair of dna breaks
the ability of cells to detect and repair dna double strand breaks dsbs is dependent on reorganization of the surrounding chromatin structure by chromatin remodeling complexes these complexes promote access to the site of dna damage facilitate processing of the damaged dna and importantly are essential to repackage the repaired dna here we will review the chromatin remodeling steps that occur immediately after dsb production and that prepare the damaged chromatin template for processing by the dsb repair machinery dsbs promote rapid accumulation of repressive complexes including hp  the nurd complex h a z and histone methyltransferases at the dsb this shift to a repressive chromatin organization may be important to inhibit local transcription and limit mobility of the break and to maintain the dna ends in close contact subsequently the repressive chromatin is rapidly dismantled through a mechanism involving dynamic exchange of the histone variant h a z h a z removal at dsbs alters the acidic patch on the nucleosome surface promoting acetylation of the h tail by the nua tip  complex and shifting the chromatin to a more open structure further h a z removal promotes chromatin ubiquitination and recruitment of additional dsb repair proteins to the break modulation of the nucleosome surface and nucleosome function during dsb repair therefore plays a vital role in processing of dna breaks further the nucleosome surface may function as a central hub during dsb repair directing specific patterns of histone modification recruiting dna repair proteins and modulating chromatin packing during processing of the damaged dna template
