inhibition of glycosaminoglycan mediated amyloid formation by islet amyloid polypeptide and proiapp processing intermediates
islet amyloid polypeptide iapp also known as amylin is responsible for islet amyloid formation in type  diabetes and iapp induced toxicity is believed to contribute to the loss of  cell mass associated with the late stages of type  diabetes islet amyloid formation may also play a role in graft failure after transplantation iapp is produced as a prohormone pro islet amyloid polypeptide proiapp  and processed in the secretory granules of the pancreatic  cells partially processed forms of proiapp are found in amyloid deposits most notable is a  residue intermediate proiapp    which includes the n terminal pro extension but which has been properly processed at the c terminus incomplete processing may play a role in islet amyloid formation by promoting interactions with sulfated proteoglycans of the extracellular matrix which in turn promote amyloid formation we show that acid fuchsin     amino  methyl  sulphonatophenyl    amino  sulphonatophenyl methylene cyclohexa   dienesulphonic acid  a simple sulfonated triphenyl methyl derivative is a potent inhibitor of amyloid formation by the proiapp    intermediate the more complicated triphenyl methane derivative fast green fcf ethyl     ethyl   sulfophenyl methyl amino phenyl   hydroxy  sulfophenyl methylidene  cyclohexa   dienylidene   sulfophenyl methyl azanium also inhibits amyloid formation by iapp and the proiapp processing intermediate both compounds inhibit amyloid formation by mixtures of the proiapp intermediate and the model glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate acid fuchsin also inhibits glycosaminoglycan mediated amyloid formation by mature iapp the ability to inhibit amyloid formation is not simply due to the compounds being sulfonated since the sulfonated inhibitor of amyloid   tramiprosate is not an inhibitor of amyloid formation by proiapp
