a single destabilizing mutation f s promotes concerted unfolding of an entire globular domain in  s crystallin
conformational change and aggregation of native proteins are associated with many serious age related and neurological diseases  s crystallin is a highly stable abundant structural component of vertebrate eye lens a single f s mutation in the n terminal domain of mouse  s crystallin causes the severe opj cataract with disruption of cellular organization and appearance of fibrillar structures in the lens although the mutant protein has a near native fold at room temperature significant increases in hydrogen deuterium exchange rates were observed by nmr for all the well protected  sheet core residues throughout the entire n terminal domain of the mutant protein resulting in up to a   kcal mol reduction in the free energy of the folding unfolding equilibrium no difference was detected for the c terminal domain at a higher temperature this effect further increases to allow for a much more uniform exchange rate among the n terminal core residues and those of the least well structured surface loops this suggests a concerted unfolding intermediate of the n terminal domain while the c terminal domain stays intact increasing concentrations of guanidinium chloride produced two transitions for the opj mutant with an unfolding intermediate at    m guanidinium chloride the consequence of this partial unfolding whether by elevated temperature or by denaturant is the formation of thioflavin t staining aggregates which demonstrated fibril like morphology by atomic force microscopy seeding with the already unfolded protein enhanced the formation of fibrils the opj mutant protein provides a model for stress related unfolding of an essentially normally folded protein and production of aggregates with some of the characteristics of amyloid fibrils
