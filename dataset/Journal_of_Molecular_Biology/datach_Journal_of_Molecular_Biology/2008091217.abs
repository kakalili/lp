changing the determinants of protein stability from covalent to non covalent interactions by in vitro evolution a structural and energetic analysis
the three disulfide bonds of the gene  protein of the phage fd are essential for the conformational stability of this protein and it unfolds when they are removed by reduction or mutation previously we used an iterative in vitro selection strategy to generate a stable and functional form of the gene  protein without these disulfides it yielded optimal replacements for the disulfide bonds as well as several stabilizing second site mutations the best selected variant showed a higher thermal stability compared with the disulfide bonded wild type protein here we investigated the molecular basis of this strong stabilization by solving the crystal structure of this variant and by analyzing the contributions to the conformational stability of the selected mutations individually they could mostly be explained by improved side chain packing the r w substitution alone increased the midpoint of the thermal unfolding transition by   deg and the conformational stability by about   kj mol   this key mutation i removed a charged side chain that forms a buried salt bridge in the disulfide containing wild type protein  ii optimized the local packing with the residues that replace the c   c  disulfide and iii improved the domain interactions apparently certain residues in proteins indeed play key roles for stability
