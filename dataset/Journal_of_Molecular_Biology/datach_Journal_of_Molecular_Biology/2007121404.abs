the heterodimeric primase from the euryarchaeon pyrococcus abyssi a multifunctional enzyme for initiation and repair
we report on the characterization of the dna primase complex of the hyperthermophilic archaeon pyrococcus abyssi pab  the pab dna primase complex is composed of the proteins pabp  and pabp  which show sequence similarities to the p  and p  subunits respectively of the eukaryotic polymerase   primase complex both subunits were expressed purified and characterized the pabp  subunit alone had no rna synthesis activity but could synthesize long up to  kb dna strands addition of the pabp  subunit increased the rate of dna synthesis but decreased the length of the dna fragments synthesized and conferred rna synthesis capability moreover in our experimental conditions pab dna primase had comparable affinities for ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides and its activity was dependent on the presence of mg  and mn  interestingly pab dna primase also displayed dna polymerase gap filling and strand displacement activities genetic analyses undertaken in haloferax volcanii suggested that the eukaryotic type heterodimeric primase is essential for survival in archaeal cells our results are in favor of a multifunctional archaeal primase involved in priming and repair
