allosteric regulation points control the conformational dynamics of the molecular chaperone hsp
heat shock protein   hsp  is an atp dependent molecular chaperone responsible for the activation maturation and trafficking of several hundred client proteins in the cell it is well known that but not understood how residues far away from hsp  s nucleotide binding pocket can regulate its atpase activity a phenomenon called allosteric regulation here the computational design of allosteric mutations was combined with in vitro and in vivo experiments to unravel nucleotide responsive hot spots in the regulation of hsp  with this approach we identified both activating and inhibiting regulation points and show that changes in those amino acids affect the conformational dynamics and atpase activity of hsp  in vitro our observations that activating mutations loosen and inhibiting mutations rigidify the protein explain for the first time how hsp  changes in response to allosteric mutations additionally mutations of these allosteric regulation points can be controlled by the interplay with hsp  co chaperones thus providing cells with an efficient mechanism of modifying hsp  s intrinsic properties via different layers of regulation altogether our results show that a framework for transmitting conformational information exists in the hsp  structure
