expression of the fabs of human auto antibodies in escherichia coli optimization and determination of their fine binding characteristics and cross reactivity edited by j karn
the fabs of three human auto antibodies b  h  anti dna uk  anti phospholipid and six related hybrids have been cloned and expressed in escherichia coli and their relative binding to single stranded or double stranded dna or to cardiolipin has been assessed in the presence of modulators salts and serum  we describe optimized conditions that have led to significant improvement in the quality and quantity of the purified auto antibodies protein expression of the assembled and functionally active fabs was achievable with a yield of up to  to  mg l of culture the comparative dna cardiolipin binding analyses of the nine fabs in the presence of modulators demonstrated that b and  h  l chains possess both anti dna and anti cardiolipin activities this is the first report of the demonstration that both anti dna and anti cardiolipin activities may lie on the same light chain of a human auto antibody we provide evidence that the auto antibodies that appeared to be similar in that they bound dna or cardiolipin in conventional elisa immunoassays exhibited significant difference in their cross reactivity and binding to the antigen in the presence of modulators such auto antigen specificity and or cross reactivity may dictate the potential of an auto antibody to cause pathogenicity and may provide an explanation as to why apparently similar auto antibodies behave differently in vivo
