hydrogen bonding and catalysis a novel explanation for how a single amino acid substitution can change the ph optimum of a glycosidase edited by m f summers
the ph optima of family  xylanases are well correlated with the nature of the residue adjacent to the acid base catalyst in xylanases that function optimally under acidic conditions this residue is aspartic acid whereas it is asparagine in those that function under more alkaline conditions previous studies of wild type wt bacillus circulans xylanase bcx  with an asparagine residue at position   demonstrated that its ph dependent activity follows the ionization states of the nucleophile glu  pka   and the acid base catalyst glu   pka   as predicted from sequence comparisons substitution of this asparagine residue with an aspartic acid residue n d bcx shifts its ph optimum from   to   with an     increase in activity the bell shaped ph activity profile of this mutant enzyme follows apparent pka values of   and   based on  c nmr titrations the predominant pka values of its active site carboxyl groups are   asp     glu  and   glu   thus in contrast to the wt enzyme the ph activity profile of n d bcx appears to be set by asp  and glu  mutational kinetic and structural studies of n d bcx both in its native and covalently modified  fluoro xylobiosyl glycosyl enzyme intermediate states reveal that the xylanase still follows a double displacement mechanism with glu  serving as the nucleophile we therefore propose that asp  and glu  function together as the general acid base catalyst and that n d bcx exhibits a  reverse protonation  mechanism in which it is catalytically active when asp  with the lower pka is protonated while glu  with the higher pka is deprotonated this implies that the mutant enzyme must have an inherent catalytic efficiency at least   fold higher than that of the parental wt because only    of its population is in the correct ionization state for catalysis at its ph optimum the increased efficiency of n d bcx and by inference all  acidic  family  xylanases is attributed to the formation of a short     hydrogen bond between asp  and glu   observed in the crystal structure of the glycosyl enzyme intermediate of this enzyme that will substantially stabilize the transition state for glycosyl transfer such a mechanism may be much more commonly employed than is generally realized necessitating careful analysis of the ph dependence of enzymatic catalysis
