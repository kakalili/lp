triosephosphate isomerase  n and  c chemical shift assignments and conformational change upon ligand binding by magic angle spinning solid state nmr spectroscopy
microcrystalline uniformly  c  n enriched yeast triosephosphate isomerase tim is sequentially assigned by high resolution solid state nmr ssnmr  assignments are based on intraresidue and interresidue correlations using dipolar polarization transfer methods and guided by solution nmr assignments of the same protein we obtained information on most of the active site residues involved in chemistry including some that were not reported in a previous solution nmr study such as the side chain carbons of his  chemical shift differences comparing the microcrystalline environment to the aqueous environment appear to be mainly due to crystal packing interactions site specific perturbations of the enzyme s chemical shifts upon ligand binding are studied by ssnmr for the first time these changes monitor proteinwide conformational adjustment upon ligand binding including many of the sites probed by solution nmr and x ray studies changes in gln   ala   and gly  were observed in our ssnmr studies but were not reported in solution nmr studies chicken or yeast  these studies identify a number of new sites with particularly clear markers for ligand binding paving the way for future studies of triosephosphate isomerase dynamics and mechanism
