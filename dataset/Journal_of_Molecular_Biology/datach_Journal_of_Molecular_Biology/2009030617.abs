hepatoma derived growth factor represses set and mynd domain containing  gene expression through interaction with c terminal binding protein
hepatoma derived growth factor hdgf is a nuclear protein with both mitogenic and angiogenic activity that is highly expressed in the developing heart and vasculature to date the mechanism underlying the function of hdgf is unknown oligonucleotide microarray analysis was used to gain insights into hdgf function adenoviral expression of hdgf significantly    fold downregulated a large group   of genes and increased expression of a relatively small number of genes   two groups of target genes that are involved in cardiovascular development and transcriptional regulation including the skeletal cardiac muscle specific set and mynd domain containing  smyd  gene were validated by real time pcr this suggested that hdgf could function as a transcriptional repressor in a one hybrid system gbd hdgf significantly repressed reporter gene activity in a dose dependent manner this demonstrated that hdgf has transcriptional repressive activity moreover in g  myoblast cells over expression of a gfp  hdgf fusion specifically downregulated smyd mrna expression and the activity of the human smyd promoter hdgf repressed smyd gene transcription through interaction with a transcriptional corepressor c terminal binding protein ctbp  over expression of ctbp potentiated the trans repressive activity of hdgf on the other hand knocking down ctbp attenuated the trans repressive effect of hdgf hdgf binds ctbp through a non canonical binding motif pkdlf within the pwwp domain as mutation of dl to as abolished hdgf and ctbp interaction and diminished the trans repressive effect of hdgf without affecting dna binding finally fluorescent microscopy showed that hdgf induced the nuclear accumulation of ctbp suggesting that hdgf forms a transcriptional complex with ctbp taken together our data demonstrate that hdgf functions as a transcriptional repressor of the smyd gene through interaction with the transcriptional corepressor ctbp because of moderate conservation of the ctbp binding motif in hdgf family members trans repressive activity mediated by ctbp may be a common function among hdgf proteins
