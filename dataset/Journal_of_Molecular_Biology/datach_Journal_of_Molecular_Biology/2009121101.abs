direct binding of glyceraldehyde  phosphate dehydrogenase to telomeric dna protects telomeres against chemotherapy induced rapid degradation
glyceraldehyde  phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh is a glycolytic enzyme that displays several non glycolytic activities including the maintenance and or protection of telomeres in this study we determined the molecular mechanism and biological role of the interaction between gapdh and human telomeric dna using gel shift assays we show that recombinant gapdh binds directly with high affinity kd   nm to a single stranded oligonucleotide comprising three telomeric dna repeats and that nucleotides t  g  and g of the ttaggg repeat are essential for binding the stoichiometry of the interaction is   dna gapdh  and gapdh appears to form a high molecular weight complex when bound to the oligonucleotide mutation of asp  and cys   which are localized to the nad binding site and the active site center of gapdh respectively produced mutants that almost completely lost their telomere binding functions both in vitro and in situ in a  human lung cancer cells  treatment of a  cells with the chemotherapeutic agents gemcitabine and doxorubicin resulted in increased nuclear localization of expressed wild type gapdh where it protected telomeres against rapid degradation concomitant with increased resistance to the growth inhibitory effects of these drugs the non dna binding mutants of gapdh also localized to the nucleus when expressed in a  cells but did not confer any significant protection of telomeres against chemotherapy induced degradation or growth inhibition this occurred without the involvement of caspase activation or apoptosis regulation overall these data demonstrate that gapdh binds telomeric dna directly in vitro and may have a biological role in the protection of telomeres against rapid degradation in response to chemotherapeutic agents in a  human lung cancer cells
