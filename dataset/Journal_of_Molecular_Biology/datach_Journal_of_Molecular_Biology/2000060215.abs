evidence from mutational specificity studies that yeast dna polymerases  and  replicate different dna strands at an intracellular replication fork edited by a r fersht
although polymerases  and  are required for dna replication in eukaryotic cells whether each polymerase functions on a separate template strand remains an open question to begin examining the relative intracellular roles of the two polymerases we used a plasmid borne yeast trna gene and yeast strains that are mutators due to the elimination of proofreading by dna polymerases  or   inversion of the trna gene to change the sequence of the leading and lagging strand templates altered the specificities of both mutator polymerases but in opposite directions that is the specificity of the polymerase  mutator with the trna gene in one orientation bore similarities to the specificity of the polymerase  mutator with the trna gene in the other orientation and vice versa we also obtained results consistent with gene orientation having a minor influence on mismatch correction of replication errors occurring in a wild type strain however the data suggest that neither this effect nor differential replication fidelity was responsible for the mutational specificity changes observed in the proofreading deficient mutants upon gene inversion collectively the data argue that polymerases  and  each encounter a different template sequence upon inversion of the trna gene and so replicate opposite strands at the plasmid dna replication fork
