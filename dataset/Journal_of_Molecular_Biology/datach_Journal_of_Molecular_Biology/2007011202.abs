high resolution x ray structures of human apoferritin h chain mutants correlated with their activity and metal binding sites
ferritins are a family of proteins distributed widely in nature in bacterial plant and animal cells ferritin appears to serve as a soluble bioavailable and non toxic form of iron provider ferritins from animal sources are heteropolymers composed of two types of subunit h and l which differ mainly by the presence h or absence l of active ferroxidase centres we report the crystallographic structures of four human h apoferritin variants at a resolution of up to     crystal derivatives using zn ii as redox stable alternative for fe ii  allows us to characterize the different metal binding sites the ferroxidase centre which is composed of sites a and b binds metal with a preference for the a site in addition distinct zn ii binding sites were found in the  fold axes  fold axes and on the cavity surface near the ferroxidase centre to study the importance of the distance of the two metal atoms in the ferroxidase centre single and double replacement of glutamate   site a and glutamate   site b  the two axial ligands by aspartate residues have been carried out the consequences for metal binding and the correlation with fe ii oxidation rates are discussed
