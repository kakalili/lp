stimulation of the weak atpase activity of human hsp  by a client protein edited by g von heijne
heat shock protein   hsp  is a molecular chaperone involved in the folding and assembly of a limited set of  client  proteins many of which are involved in signal transduction pathways in vivo it is found in complex with additional proteins including the chaperones hsp  hsp  hip and hop hsp interacting and hsp organising proteins respectively  as well as high molecular mass immunophilins such as fkbp  and the small acidic protein p  the role of these proteins in hsp  mediated assembly processes is poorly understood it is known that atp binding and hydrolysis are essential for hsp  function in vivo and in vitro here we show for the first time that human hsp  has atpase activity in vitro the atpase activity is characterised using a sensitive assay based on a chemically modified form of the phosphate binding protein from escherichia coli human hsp  is a very weak atpase its activity is significantly lower than that of the yeast homologue and it has a half life of atp hydrolysis of eight minutes at   c using a physiological substrate of hsp  the ligand binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor we show that this  client  protein can stimulate the atpase activity up to   fold this effect is highly specific and unfolded or partially folded proteins which are known to bind to hsp  do not affect the atpase activity in addition the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor which is related in both sequence and structure to the glucocorticoid receptor but which does not bind hsp  has no observable effect on the atpase activity we establish the effect of the co chaperones hop fkbp  and p  on the basal atpase activity as well as the client protein stimulated atpase activity of human hsp  in contrast with the yeast system human hop has little effect on the basal rate of atp hydrolysis but significantly inhibits the client protein stimulated rate similarly fkbp  has little effect on the basal rate but stimulates the client protein stimulated rate further in contrast p  inhibits both the basal and stimulated rates of atp hydrolysis our results show that the atpase activity of human hsp  is highly regulated by both client protein and co chaperone binding we suggest that the rate of atp hydrolysis is critical to the mode of action of hsp  consistent with results that have shown that both over and under active atpase mutants of yeast hsp  have impaired function in vivo we suggest that the tight regulation of the atpase activity of hsp  is important and allows the client protein to remain bound to hsp  for sufficient time for activation to occur
