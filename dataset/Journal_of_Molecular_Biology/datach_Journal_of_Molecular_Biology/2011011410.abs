amyloid fibril recognition with the conformational b  antibody fragment depends on electrostatic interactions
amyloid fibrils are naturally occurring polypeptide scaffolds with considerable importance for human health and disease these supermolecular assemblies are  sheet rich and characterized by a high structural order clinical diagnosis and emerging therapeutic strategies of amyloid dependent diseases such as alzheimer s rely on the specific recognition of amyloid structures by other molecules recently we generated the b  antibody fragment which selectively binds to alzheimer s a      amyloid fibrils but does not explicitly recognize other protein conformers such as oligomers and disaggregated a  peptide b  presents poly amyloid specific binding and interacts with fibrillar structures consisting of different polypeptide chains to determine the molecular basis behind its specificity we have analyzed the molecular properties of b  with a battery of biochemical and biophysical techniques ranging from x ray crystallography to chemical modification studies we find that fibril recognition depends on positively charged residues within the b  antigen binding site mutation of these basic residues into alanine potently impairs fibril binding and reduced b   fibril interactions are also observed when the fibril carboxyl groups are covalently masked by a chemical modification approach these data imply that the b  conformational specificity for amyloid fibrils depends upon specific electrostatic interactions with an acidic moiety which is common to different amyloid fibrils
