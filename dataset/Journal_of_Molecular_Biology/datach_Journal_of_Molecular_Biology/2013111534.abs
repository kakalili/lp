structural mechanism of replication stalling on a bulky amino polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon dna adduct by a y family dna polymerase
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and their nitro derivatives are culprits of the detrimental health effects of environmental pollution these hydrophobic compounds metabolize to reactive species and attach to dna producing bulky lesions such as n deoxyguanosine  yl  aminopyrene apg  in genomic dna the bulky adducts block dna replication by high fidelity polymerases and compromise replication fidelities and efficiencies by specialized lesion bypass polymerases here we present three crystal structures of the dna polymerase dpo  a model translesion dna polymerase of the y family in complex with apg lesion containing dna in pre insertion and extension stages apg is captured in two conformations in the pre insertion complex one is highly exposed to the solvent whereas the other is harbored in a shallow cleft between the finger and unique y family little finger domain in contrast apg is in a single conformation at the extension stage in which the pyrene ring is sandwiched between the little finger domain and a base from the turning back single stranded template strand strikingly a nucleotide intercalates the dna helix to form a quaternary complex with dpo  dna and an incoming nucleotide which stabilizes the distorted dna structure at the extension stage the unique apg dna conformations in dpo inhibit dna translocation through the polymerase active site for apg bypass we also modeled an insertion complex that illustrates a solvent exposed pyrene ring contributing to an unstable insertion state the structural work combined with our lesion replication assays provides a novel structural mechanism on bypass of dna adducts containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon moieties
