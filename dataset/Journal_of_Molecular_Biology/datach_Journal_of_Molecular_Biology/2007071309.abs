cenp a containing nucleosomes easier disassembly versus exclusive centromeric localization
cenp a is a histone variant that replaces conventional h in nucleosomes of functional centromeres we report here from reconstitutions of cenp a and h containing nucleosomes on linear dna fragments and the comparison of their electrophoretic mobility that cenp a induces some positioning of its own and some unwrapping at the entry  exit relative to canonical nucleosomes on both  s dna and the  satellite sequence on which it is normally loaded this steady state unwrapping was quantified to     bp by nucleosome reconstitutions on a series of dna minicircles followed by their relaxation with topoisomerase i the unwrapping was found to ease nucleosome invasion by exonuclease iii to hinder the binding of a linker histone and to promote the release of an h a h b dimer by nucleosome assembly protein  nap   the cenp a h  tetramer was also more readily destabilized with heparin than the h h  tetramer suggesting that cenp a has evolved to confer its nucleosome a specific ability to disassemble this dual relative instability is proposed to facilitate the progressive clearance of cenp a nucleosomes that assemble promiscuously in euchromatin especially as is seen following cenp a transient over expression
