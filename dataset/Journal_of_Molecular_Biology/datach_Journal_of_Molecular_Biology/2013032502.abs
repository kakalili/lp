fuzzy complex formation between the intrinsically disordered prothymosin  and the kelch domain of keap involved in the oxidative stress response
kelch like ech associated protein  keap  is an inhibitor of nuclear factor erythroid  related factor  nrf  a key transcription factor for cytoprotective gene activation in the oxidative stress response under unstressed conditions keap interacts with nrf in the cytoplasm via its kelch domain and suppresses the transcriptional activity of nrf  during oxidative stress nrf is released from keap and is translocated into the nucleus where it interacts with the small maf protein to initiate gene transcription prothymosin   prot   an intrinsically disordered protein also interacts with the kelch domain of keap and mediates the import of keap into the nucleus to inhibit nrf activity to gain a molecular basis understanding of the oxidative stress response mechanism we have characterized the interaction between prot  and the kelch domain of keap by using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy isothermal titration calorimetry peptide array analysis site directed mutagenesis and molecular dynamic simulations the results of nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shift mapping amide hydrogen exchange and spin relaxation measurements revealed that prot  retains a high level of flexibility even in the bound state with kelch this finding is in agreement with the observations from the molecular dynamic simulations of the prot   kelch complex mutational analysis of prot  guided by peptide array data and isothermal titration calorimetry further pinpointed that the region  naneenge  of prot  is crucial for the interaction with the kelch domain while the flanking residues play relatively minor roles in the affinity of binding
