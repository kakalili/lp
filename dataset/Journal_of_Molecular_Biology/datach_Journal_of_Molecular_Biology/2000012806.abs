the structure of the hiv  rre high affinity rev binding site at    resolution edited by i tinoco
the crystal structure of a  nt rna fragment containing the human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  rev response element high affinity binding site for rev protein has been solved at    resolution the overall structure of the rre helix is greatly distorted from a form geometry by the presence of two purine purine base pairs and two single nucleotide bulges g  and g  form a hoogsteen type asymmetric base pair with g  adopting a syn conformation the non canonical regions in the unliganded rev response element molecule narrow the major groove width with respect to standard a rna the rev response element structure observed here represents a closed form of the rev binding site and differs from conformations of the rna observed previously by solution nmr studies
