two homologous rat cellular retinol binding proteins differ in local conformational flexibility
cellular retinol binding protein i crbp i and cellular retinol binding protein ii crbp ii are closely homologous proteins that play distinct roles in the maintenance of vitamin a homeostasis the solution structure and dynamics of crbp i and crbp ii were compared by multidimensional nmr techniques these studies indicated that differences in the mean backbone structures of crbp i and crbp ii were localized primarily to the  ii helix intraligand noe cross peaks were detected for the hydroxyl proton in the noesy spectrum of crbp i bound retinol but not for crbp ii bound retinol indicating that the conformational dynamics of retinol binding are different for these two proteins as determined by lipari  szabo formalism both the apo and holo forms of crbp i and crbp ii are conformationally rigid on the pico to nanosecond timescale transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy carr purcell meiboom gill based  n relaxation dispersion experiments at both   mhz and   mhz magnetic fields revealed that  and  residues for apo crbp i and ii respectively showed detectable conformational exchange on a micro to millisecond timescale in contrast to three and seven residues for holo crbp i and ii respectively thus binding of retinol markedly reduced conformational flexibility in both crbp i and crbp ii on the micro to millisecond timescale the  n relaxation dispersion curves of apo crbp i and ii were fit to a two state conformational exchange model by a global iterative fitting process and by an individual residue fitting process in the process of carrying out the global fit more than half of the residue sites were eliminated the individual chemical exchange rates kex and chemical shift differences    were increased in the putative portal region  ii helix and  c  d turn of apo crbp ii compared to apo crbp i these differences in conformational flexibility likely contribute to differences in how crbp i and crbp ii interact with ligands membranes and retinoid metabolizing enzymes
