efficient and high fidelity incorporation of dye terminators by a novel archaeal dna polymerase mutant
we examined the molecular basis of ddntp selectivity in archaeal family b dna polymerases by randomly mutagenizing the gene encoding thermococcus sp jdf  dna polymerase and screening mutant libraries for improved ddntp incorporation we identified two mutations p  l and a  t that improved ddntp uptake suggesting the contribution of p  and a  to ddntp dntp selectivity in archaeal dna polymerases the importance of a  was identified previously in mutagenesis studies employing pfu a   and vent a   dna polymerases while the contribution of p  to ddntp dntp selectivity has not been reported we demonstrate that a combination of mutations p  l a  t has an additive effect in improving ddntp incorporation by a total of   fold to assess the usefulness of the jdf  p  l a  t in fluorescent sequencing applications we compared the archaeal mutant to taq f  y with respect to fidelity and kinetic parameters for dna and dye ddntps although the taq f  y and jdf  p  l a  t mutants exhibit similar km and vmax values for dye ddntps in single base extension assays the archaeal mutant exhibits higher fidelity due to a reduced tendency to form certain ddg dt ddt dc mispairs dna polymerases exhibiting higher insertion fidelity are expected to provide greater accuracy in snp frequency determinations by single base extension and in multiplex minisequencing assays
