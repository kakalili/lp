a contact photo cross linking investigation of the active site of the   deoxyribozyme
the small rna cleaving   deoxyribozyme dnazyme has been the subject of extensive mechanistic and structural investigation including a number of recent single molecule studies of its global folding little detailed insight exists however into this dnazyme s active site for instance the identity of specific nucleotides that are proximal to or in contact with the scissile site in the substrate here we report a systematic replacement of a number of bases within the magnesium folded dnazyme  substrate complex with thio and halogen substituted base analogues which were then photochemically activated to generate contact cross links within the complex mapping of the cross links revealed a striking pattern of dnazyme  substrate cross links but an absence of significant intra dnazyme cross links notably the two nucleotides directly flanking the scissile phosphodiester cross linked strongly with functionally important elements within the dnazyme the thymine of a g t wobble base pair a wcgr bulge loop and a terminal agc loop mutation of the wobble base pair to a g  c pair led to a significant folding instability of the dnazyme  substrate complex the cross linking patterns obtained were used to generate a model for the dnazyme s active site that had the substrate s scissile phosphodiester sandwiched between the dnazyme s wobble thymine and its agc and wcgr loops
