the structure of the sec   copii cage bound to sec
structural studies have revealed some of the organizing principles and mechanisms involved in the assembly of the copii coat including the location of the sec   adapter layer previous studies however were unable to unambiguously determine the positions of sec  and sec  in the coat here we have determined a cryogenic electron microscopic structure of sec   together with sec  electron tomography revealed that the binding of sec  induces sec   to form a variety of different geometries including a cuboctahedron as was previously characterized for sec   alone single particle reconstruction of the sec      cuboctahedra revealed that the binding of sec  induces a conformational change in sec    resulting in a more extended conformation docking sec  crystal structures into the electron microscopy map suggested that sec  projects its cargo binding surface out into the large open faces of the coat these results have implications for the mechanisms by which copii transports large cargos cargos with large intracellular domains and for tethering complexes that must project out of the coat in order to interact with their binding partners furthermore sec  binds sec   at two unique sites in the coat which suggests that each site may have unique roles in the mechanisms of copii vesiculation
