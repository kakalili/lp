noncompetitive inhibition of hepatocyte growth factor dependent met signaling by a phage derived peptide
dysregulation of hepatocyte growth factor hgf induced signaling via its receptor tyrosine kinase met results in tumor progression and metastasis to initiate signaling pro hgf must be proteolytically activated to reveal a secondary met binding site within the serine protease like  chain of hgf although hgf met is a large complex we sought to discover relatively small antagonists that might interfere with this critical met binding region pools of disulfide constrained random peptide libraries displayed on phage were selected for binding to hgf ultimately resulting in a disulfide constrained  mer peptide vnwvcfrdvgcdwvl termed hb  which bound to the recombinant human hgf  chain hgf   and competitively inhibited binding to met with an ic  of   nm in mda mb  cells hb  reduced hgf dependent met phosphorylation by   and phosphorylation of downstream kinases akt and erk erk by   and   respectively addition of hb  also inhibited hgf dependent migration of these cells with an ic  of     m the d h nmr structure of hb  revealed a  hairpin loop stabilized by the disulfide bond and cross strand pairing of trp and trp  hgf  mutants deficient in met binding also have reduced hb  binding suggesting an overlapping binding site notably hb  did not inhibit full length hgf binding to met thus steric hindrance of the interaction between hgf  domain binding to met is sufficient for inhibiting full length hgf dependent met signaling and cell migration that is consistent with a noncompetitive inhibitory mechanism of met signal transduction
