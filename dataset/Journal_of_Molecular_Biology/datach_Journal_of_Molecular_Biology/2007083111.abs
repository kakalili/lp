structural and functional analysis of two glutamate racemase isozymes from bacillus anthracis and implications for inhibitor design
glutamate racemase race is responsible for converting l glutamate to d glutamate which is an essential component of peptidoglycan biosynthesis and the primary constituent of the poly  d glutamate capsule of the pathogen bacillus anthracis race enzymes are essential for bacterial growth and lack a human homolog making them attractive targets for the design and development of antibacterial therapeutics we have cloned expressed and purified the two glutamate racemase isozymes race and race  from the b anthracis genome through a series of steady state kinetic studies and based upon the ability of both race and race to catalyze the rapid formation of d glutamate we have determined that race and race are bona fide isozymes the x ray structures of b anthracis race and race  in complex with d glutamate were determined to resolutions of     and     both enzymes are dimers with monomers arranged in a  tail to tail  orientation similar to the b subtilis race structure but differing substantially from the aquifex pyrophilus race structure the differences in quaternary structures produce differences in the active sites of racemases among the various species which has important implications for structure based inhibitor design efforts within this class of enzymes we found a val to ala variance at the entrance of the active site between race and race  which results in the active site entrance being less sterically hindered for race  using a series of inhibitors we show that this variance results in differences in the inhibitory activity against the two isozymes and suggest a strategy for structure based inhibitor design to obtain broad spectrum inhibitors for glutamate racemases
