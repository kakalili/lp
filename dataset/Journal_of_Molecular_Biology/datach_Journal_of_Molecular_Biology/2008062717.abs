recruitment of creb and histone deacetylase  hdac  to the mouse ltbp  promoter regulates its constitutive expression in a dioxin receptor dependent manner
latent tgf  binding protein  ltbp  is a key regulator of tgf  targeting and activation in the extracellular matrix ltbp  is recognized as a major docking molecule to localize and possibly to activate tgf  in the extracellular matrix despite this relevant function the molecular mechanisms regulating ltbp  transcription remain largely unknown previous results from our laboratory revealed that mouse embryonic fibroblasts mef lacking dioxin receptor ahr had increased ltbp  mrna expression and elevated tgf  activity suggesting that ahr repressed ltbp  transcription here we have cloned the mouse ltbp  gene promoter and analysed its mechanism of transcriptional repression by ahr reporter gene assays ahr over expression and site directed mutagenesis showed that basal ltbp  transcription is ahr dependent chromatin immunoprecipitation chip and rna interference rnai revealed that ahr regulates ltbp  transcription by a mechanism involving recruitment of co activators such as creb and co repressors such as hdac to the ltbp  promoter in ahr expressing ahr   mef cells the recruitment of hdac   and  correlated with decreased k h acetylation and impaired binding of pcrebser  to the ltbp  promoter likely maintaining a constitutive repressed state ahr    mef cells had the opposite pattern of hdacs and pcreb ser  binding to ltbp  promoter and therefore over expressed ltbp  mrna in agreement sirna for hdac increased ltbp  expression and k h acetylation in ahr  but not in ahr    mef cells we suggest that hdac binding keeps ltbp  promoter repressed in ahr  mef cells whereas in ahr null mef cells the absence of hdac and the binding of pcrebser  allow ltbp  transcription thus epigenetics can contribute to constitutive ltbp  repression by a mechanism requiring ahr activity
