the role of arg  towards base flipping base stabilization and catalysis in m hhai
arg  forms part of a previously identified base flipping motif in the bacterial dna cytosine methyltransferase m hhai replacement of arg  with ala has no detectable effect on either dna or adomet affinity yet causes the base flipping and restacking transitions to be decreased    and   fold respectively thus confirming the importance of this motif however these kinetic changes cannot account for the mutant s observed   fold decreased catalytic rate the mutant enzyme cognate dna cocrystal structure      resolution shows the target cytosine to be positioned     into the major groove which is consistent with a major groove pathway for nucleotide flipping the pyrimidine sugar  angle is rotated to approximately     from a range of     to     in b dna and     in the wt m hhai complex thus arg  is important for maintaining the cytosine positioned for nucleophilic attack by cys  the cytosine sugar pucker is in the c   endo c   exo south conformation  in contrast to the previously reported c   endo north conformation described for the original     resolution cocrystal structure of the wt m hhai dna complex we determined a high resolution structure of the wt m hhai dna complex      to better determine the sugar pucker this new structure is similar to the original lower resolution wt m hhai complex but shows that the sugar pucker is o   endo east conformation  intermediate between the south and north conformers in summary arg  plays significant roles in base flipping cytosine positioning and catalysis furthermore the previously proposed m hhai mediated changes in sugar pucker may not be an important contributor to the base flipping mechanism these results provide insights into the base flipping and catalytic mechanisms for bacterial and eukaryotic dna methyltransferases
