distinct regions of human eif are sufficient for binding to the hcv ires and the  s ribosomal subunit
translation of the hepatitis c virus hcv genomic rna initiates from an internal ribosome entry site ires in its   untranslated region and requires a minimal subset of translation initiation factors to occur namely eukaryotic initiation factor eif  and eif  low resolution structural information has revealed how the hcv ires rna binds human eif and the  s ribosomal subunit and positions the start codon for initiation however the exact nature of the interactions between the hcv ires rna and the translational machinery remains unknown using limited proteolysis and mass spectrometry we show that distinct regions of human eif are sufficient for binding to the hcv ires rna and the  s subunit notably the eif subunit eif b is protected by hcv ires rna binding yet is exposed in the complex when compared to subunits eif e eif f eif h and eif l limited proteolysis reveals that eif binding to the  s ribosomal subunit occurs through many redundant interactions that can compensate for each other these data suggest how the hcv ires binds to specific regions of eif to target the translational machinery to the viral genomic rna and provide a framework for modeling the architecture of intact human eif
