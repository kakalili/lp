changing the direction of flagellar rotation in bacteria by modulating the ratio between the rotational states of the switch protein flim edited by b holland
one of the major questions in bacterial chemotaxis is how the switch which controls the direction of flagellar rotation functions it is well established that binding of the signaling molecule chey to the switch protein flim shifts the rotation from the default direction counterclockwise to clockwise how this shift is done is still a mystery our aim in this study was to determine the correlation between the fraction of flim molecules in the clockwise state i e occupied by chey and the probability of clockwise rotation for this purpose we gradually expressed from a plasmid a clockwise flim mutant protein in cells that express from the chromosome wild type flim but no chemotaxis proteins we verified that plasmid borne flim exchanges chromosomal flim in the switch surprisingly a substantial clockwise probability was not obtained before the large majority of the flim molecules in the switch were clockwise molecules thereafter the rise in clockwise probability was very steep these results suggest that an increase in the clockwise probability requires a high level of flim occupancy by chey   p they further suggest that the steep increase in clockwise rotation upon increasing chey levels reported in several studies is due at least in part to cooperativity of post binding interactions within the switch we also carried out the inverse experiment in which wild type flim was gradually expressed in a background of a clockwise flim mutant in this case the level of the clockwise mutant protein required for establishing a certain clockwise probability was lower than in the original experiment if our system in which the ratio between the rotational states of flim in the switch is established by slow exchange and the native system in which the ratio is established by fast changes in flim occupancy are comparable the results suggest that hysteresis is involved in the switch function such a situation might reflect a damping mechanism which prevents a situation in which fluctuations in the phosphorylation level of chey throw the switch from one direction of rotation to the other
