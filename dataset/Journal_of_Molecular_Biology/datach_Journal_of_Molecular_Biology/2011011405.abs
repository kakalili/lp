structural insight into the expanded pcb degrading abilities of a biphenyl dioxygenase obtained by directed evolution
the biphenyl dioxygenase of burkholderia xenovorans lb  is a multicomponent rieske type oxygenase that catalyzes the dihydroxylation of biphenyl and many polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs  the structural bases for the substrate specificity of the enzyme s oxygenase component bphaelb   are largely unknown bphaep  a variant previously obtained through directed evolution transforms several chlorobiphenyls including   dichlorobiphenyl more efficiently than bphaelb   yet differs from the parent oxygenase at only two positions t  a f  m here we compare the structures of bphaelb  and bphaep and examine the biochemical properties of two bphaelb  variants with single substitutions t  a or f  m our data show that residue   contacts the biphenyl and influences the regiospecificity of the reaction but does not enhance the enzyme s reactivity toward   dichlorobiphenyl by contrast residue   does not contact biphenyl but contributes significantly to expansion of the enzyme s substrate range crystal structures indicate that thr  imposes constraints through hydrogen bonds and nonbonded contacts to the segment from val  to gln   these contacts are lost when thr is replaced by ala relieving intramolecular constraints and allowing for significant movement of this segment during binding of   dichlorobiphenyl which increases the space available to accommodate the doubly ortho chlorinated congener   dichlorobiphenyl this study provides important insight about how rieske type oxygenases can expand substrate range through mutations that increase the plasticity and or mobility of protein segments lining the catalytic cavity
