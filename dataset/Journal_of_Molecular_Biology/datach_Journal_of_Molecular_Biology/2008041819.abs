hydrophobic effect on the stability and folding of a hyperthermophilic protein
ribonuclease hii from hyperthermophile thermococcus kodakaraensis tk rnase hii is a kinetically robust monomeric protein the conformational stability and folding kinetics of tk rnase hii were measured for nine mutant proteins in which a buried larger hydrophobic side chain is replaced by a smaller one leu ile to ala  the mutant proteins were destabilized by   to    kj mol   as compared with the wild type protein the removal of each  ch   group burial decreased the stability by   kj mol   on average in the mutant proteins of tk rnase hii examined this is comparable with the value of   kj mol   obtained from experiments for proteins from organisms growing at moderate temperature we conclude that the hydrophobic residues buried inside protein molecules contribute to the stabilization of hyperthermophilic proteins to a similar extent as proteins at normal temperature in the folding experiments the mutant proteins of tk rnase hii examined exhibited faster unfolding compared with the wild type protein these results indicate that the buried hydrophobic residues strongly contribute to the kinetic robustness of tk rnase hii this is the first report that provides a practical cause of slow unfolding of hyperthermostable proteins
