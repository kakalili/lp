broad ranges of affinity and specificity of anti histone antibodies revealed by a quantitative peptide immunoprecipitation assay
antibodies directed against histone posttranslational modifications ptms are critical tools in epigenetics research particularly in the widely used chromatin immunoprecipitation chip experiments however a lack of quantitative methods for characterizing such antibodies has been a major bottleneck in accurate and reproducible analysis of histone modifications here we report a simple and sensitive method for quantitatively characterizing polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies for histone ptms in a chip like format importantly it determines the apparent dissociation constants for the interactions of an antibody with peptides harboring cognate or off target ptms analyses of commercial antibodies revealed large ranges of affinity specificity and binding capacity as well as substantial lot to lot variations suggesting the importance of quantitatively characterizing each antibody intended to be used in chip experiments and optimizing experimental conditions accordingly furthermore using this method we identified additional factors potentially affecting the interpretation of chip experiments
