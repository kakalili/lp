flexible connectors between capsomer subunits that regulate capsid assembly
viruses build icosahedral capsids of specific size and shape by regulating the spatial arrangement of the hexameric and pentameric protein capsomers in the growing shell during assembly in the t  capsids of escherichia coli bacteriophage hk  and other phages   capsomers are hexons while the rest are pentons that are correctly positioned during assembly assembly of the hk  capsid to the correct size and shape has been shown to depend on specific ionic contacts between capsomers we now describe additional ionic interactions within capsomers that also regulate assembly each is between the long hairpin the  e loop   that extends from one subunit to the adjacent subunit within the same capsomer glutamate e  on the e loop and arginine r  on the adjacent subunit s backbone alpha helix form salt bridges in hexamers and pentamers mutations that disrupt these salt bridges were lethal for virus production because the mutant proteins assembled into tubes or sheets instead of capsids x ray structures show that the e   r  links are flexible and maintained during maturation despite radical changes in capsomer shape the e   r  links appear to form early in assembly to enable capsomers to make programmed changes in their shape during assembly the links also prevent flattening of capsomers and premature maturation mutant phenotypes and modeling support an assembly model in which flexible e   r  links mediate capsomer shape changes that control where pentons are placed to create normal sized capsids the e loop may be conserved in other systems in order to play similar roles in regulating assembly
