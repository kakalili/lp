blood group antigen recognition by a solute binding protein from a serotype  strain of streptococcus pneumoniae
streptococcus pneumoniae is a common bacterial pathogen that is well known for its ability to cause acute respiratory disease pneumonia  ear infections and other serious illnesses this gram positive bacterium relies on its carbohydrate metabolizing capabilities for full virulence in its host however the range of glycan targets that it can attack is presently not fully appreciated s pneumoniae is known to have a fucose utilization operon that in the tigr strain plays a role in its virulence here we identify a second type of fucose utilization operon that is present in a subset of s pneumoniae strains including the serotype  strain sp bs  this operon contains a transporter with a solute binding protein fcssbp fucose solute binding protein  that interacts tightly ka      m   and specifically with soluble a and b antigen trisaccharides but displays no selectivity between these two sugars the structure of the fcssbp in complex with the a trisaccharide antigen determined to      reveals its mode of binding to the reducing end of this sugar thus highlighting this protein s requirement for soluble blood group antigen ligands overall this report exposes a heretofore unknown capability of certain s pneumoniae strains to transport and potentially metabolize the histo blood group antigen carbohydrates of its host
