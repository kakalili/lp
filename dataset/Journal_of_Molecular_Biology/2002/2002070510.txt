The SH3 domain folding transition state structure contains two well-ordered turn regions, known as the diverging turn and the distal loop. In the Src SH3 domain transition state, these regions are stabilized by a hydrogen bond between Glu30 in the diverging turn and Ser47 in the distal loop. We have examined the effects on folding kinetics of amino acid substitutions at the homologous positions (Glu24 and Ser41) in the Fyn SH3 domain. In contrast to most other folding kinetics studies which have focused primarily on non-disruptive substitutions with Ala or Gly, here we have examined the effects of substitutions with diverse amino acid residues. Using this approach, we demonstrate that the transition state structure is generally tolerant to amino acid substitutions. We also uncover a unique role for Ser at position 41 in facilitating folding of the distal loop, which can only be replicated by Asp at the same position. Both these residues appear to accelerate folding through the formation of short-range side-chain to backbone hydrogen bonds. The folding of the diverging turn region is shown to be driven primarily by local interactions. The diverging turn and distal loop regions are found to interact in the transition state structure, but only in the context of particular mutant backgrounds. This work demonstrates that studying the effects of a variety of amino acid substitutions on protein folding kinetics can provide unique insights into folding mechanisms which cannot be obtained by standard Φ value analysis.
