the bicyclomycin sensitivities of  bicyclomycin resistant mutants of transcription termination protein rho and the location of their mutations support a structural model of rho based on the f atpase edited by m gottesman
a total of  bicyclomycin resistant mutants of escherichia coli transcription termination protein rho have been isolated the locations of their mutations identify the atp binding region as the functional domain inhibited by bicyclomycin strains containing the s  c s  a and l  r rho mutations are very resistant to bicyclomycin in vivo in a similar way the mutant rho proteins containing these mutations are very resistant to bicyclomycin in vitro these data suggest that ser  and leu  might make direct contact with the antibiotic these two residues are close to each other in the tertiary structure of a model of rho based on the alpha and beta subunits of the f atpase supporting the validity of the model the strain containing the g  s rho mutation also has high bicyclomycin resistance and the proximity of l   s  and g  in the quaternary structure of the rho model has enabled a candidate bicyclomycin binding pocket to be delineated as a whole the bicyclomycin sensitivities of the mutants are consistent with the locations of their respective mutations in the model of rho based on the f atpase therefore supporting the emerging consensus model of rho structure
