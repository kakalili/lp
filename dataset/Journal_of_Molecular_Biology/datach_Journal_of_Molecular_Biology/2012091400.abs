chea  receptor interaction sites in bacterial chemotaxis
in bacterial chemotaxis transmembrane chemoreceptors the chea histidine kinase and the chew coupling protein assemble into signaling complexes that allow bacteria to modulate their swimming behavior in response to environmental stimuli among the protein  protein interactions in the ternary complex chea  chew and chew  receptor interactions were studied previously whereas chea  receptor interaction has been less investigated here we characterize the chea  receptor interaction in thermotoga maritima by nmr spectroscopy and validate the identified receptor binding site of chea in escherichia coli chemotaxis we find that chea interacts with a chemoreceptor in a manner similar to that of chew and the receptor binding site of chea s regulatory domain is homologous to that of chew collectively the receptor binding sites in the chea  chew complex suggest that conformational changes in chea are required for assembly of the chea  chew  receptor ternary complex and chea activation
