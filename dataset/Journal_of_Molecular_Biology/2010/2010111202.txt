The architectural DNA-binding protein HMGB1 consists of two tandem HMG-box domains joined by a basic linker to a C-terminal acidic tail, which negatively regulates HMGB1–DNA interactions by binding intramolecularly to the DNA-binding faces of both basic HMG boxes. Here we demonstrate, using NMR chemical-shift mapping at different salt concentrations, that the tail has a higher affinity for the B box and that A box–tail interactions are preferentially disrupted. Previously, we proposed a model in which the boxes are brought together in a collapsed, tail-mediated assembly, which is in dynamic equilibrium with a more extended form. Small-angle X-ray scattering data are consistent with such a dynamic equilibrium between collapsed and extended structures and are best represented by an ensemble. The ensembles contain a significantly higher proportion of collapsed structures when the tail is present. 15N NMR relaxation measurements show that full-length HMGB1 has a significantly lower rate of rotational diffusion than the tail-less protein, consistent with the loss of independent domain motions in an assembled complex. Mapping studies using the paramagnetic spin label MTSL [(1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-pyrrolidin-3-yl)methyl methanethiosulfonate] placed at three locations in the tail confirm our previous findings that the tail binds to both boxes with some degree of specificity. The end of the tail lies further from the body of the protein and is therefore potentially free to interact with other proteins. MTSL labelling at a single site in the A domain (C44) causes detectable relaxation enhancements of B domain residues, suggesting the existence of a “sandwich”-like collapsed structure in which the tail enables the close approach of the basic domains. These intramolecular interactions are presumably important for the dynamic association of HMGB1 with chromatin and provide a mechanism by which protein–protein interactions or posttranslational modifications might regulate the function of the protein at particular sites, or at particular stages in the cell cycle.
