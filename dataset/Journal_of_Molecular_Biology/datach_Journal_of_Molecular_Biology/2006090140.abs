crystal structure of a non discriminating glutamyl trna synthetase
error free protein biosynthesis is dependent on the reliable charging of each trna with its cognate amino acid many bacteria however lack a glutaminyl trna synthetase in these organisms trnagln is initially mischarged with glutamate by a non discriminating glutamyl trna synthetase nd glurs  this enzyme thus charges both trnaglu and trnagln with glutamate discriminating glurs d glurs  found in some bacteria and all eukaryotes exclusively generates glu trnaglu here we present the first crystal structure of a non discriminating glurs from thermosynechococcus elongatus nd glurstel in complex with glutamate at a resolution of      structurally the enzyme shares the overall architecture of the discriminating glurs from thermus thermophilus d glurstth  we confirm experimentally that glurstel is non discriminating and present kinetic parameters for synthesis of glu trnaglu and of glu trnagln anticodons of trnaglu  c uuc  and trnagln  c uug  differ only in base   the pyrimidine base of c  is specifically recognized in d glurstth by the residue arg   in nd glurstel this arginine residue is replaced by glycine gly   presumably allowing both cytosine and the bulkier purine base g  of trnagln to be tolerated most other nd glurs share this structural feature leading to relaxed substrate specificity
