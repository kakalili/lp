analysis of the interactions of human ribonuclease inhibitor with angiogenin and ribonuclease a by mutagenesis importance of inhibitor residues inside versus outside the c terminal  hot spot   edited by j wells
ribonuclease inhibitor ri binds diverse mammalian rnases with extraordinary avidity here we have investigated the structural basis for this tight binding and broad specificity by mutational analysis of the complexes of ri with angiogenin ang and rnase a kd   fm and  fm respectively  both crystal structures are known the interfaces are large and the ligands dock similarly although few of the specific interactions formed are analogous our previous mutagenesis studies focused primarily on one contact region containing ri      and the enzymatic active site many single residue replacements produced extensive losses of binding energy      kcal mol  suggesting that this region constitutes a  hot spot  in both cases we have now explored the roles of most of the remaining ri residues that interact with ang and or rnase a one major cluster in each complex lies in a trp rich area of ri containing trp   trp   trp   and trp   although the energy losses from individual replacements in this portion of the ang complex were small to moderate     kcal mol  the changes from multiple substitutions were much greater than additive and the binding energy provided by this region is estimated to be   kcal mol    of total  effects of replacing combinations of hot spot components had also been found to be superadditive and this negative cooperativity is now shown to extend to the neighboring contact residue ri ser   the overall contribution of the hot spot taking superadditivity into account is then      kcal mol the hot spot and trp rich regions although spatially well separated are themselves functionally linked no other parts of the ri ang interface appear to be energetically important binding of rnase a is more sensitive to substitutions throughout the interface with free energy losses   kcal mol produced by nearly all replacements examined so that the sum of losses greatly exceeds the binding energy of the complex this discrepancy can be explained in part by positive cooperativity as evident from the subadditive effects observed when combinations of residues in either the hot spot or trp rich region are replaced these findings suggest that the binding energy may be more widely distributed in the rnase a complex than in the ang complex
