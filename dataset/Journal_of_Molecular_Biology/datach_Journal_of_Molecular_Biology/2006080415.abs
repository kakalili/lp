non nucleoside inhibitors binding to hepatitis c virus ns b polymerase reveal a novel mechanism of inhibition
the rna dependent rna polymerase ns b from hepatitis c virus hcv is a key enzyme in hcv replication ns b is a major target for the development of antiviral compounds directed against hcv here we present the structures of three thiophene based non nucleoside inhibitors nnis bound non covalently to ns b each of the inhibitors binds to ns b non competitively to a common binding site in the  thumb  domain that is      from the polymerase active site located in the  palm  domain the three compounds exhibit ic  values in the range of   nm to   nm and have common binding features that result in relatively large conformational changes of residues that interact directly with the inhibitors as well as for other residues adjacent to the binding site detailed comparisons of the unbound ns b structure with those having the bound inhibitors present show that residues pro  to arg   the n terminus of the  t  helix exhibit some of the largest changes it has been reported that pro   pro   val  and arg  are part of the guanosine triphosphate gtp specific allosteric binding site located in close proximity to our binding site it has also been reported that the introduction of mutations to key residues in this region i e val  gly ablate in vivo sub genomic hcv rna replication the details of ns b polymerase inhibitor binding interactions coupled with the observed induced conformational changes provide new insights into the design of novel nnis of hcv
