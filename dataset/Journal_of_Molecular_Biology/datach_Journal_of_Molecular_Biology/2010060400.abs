a new mode of dimerization of allosteric enzymes with act domains revealed by the crystal structure of the aspartate kinase from cyanobacteria
aspartate kinases aks can be divided in two subhomology divisions ak  and ak  depending on the presence of an extra sequence of about  amino acids which is found only in the n terminus of all ak  s to date the structures of ak  failed to provide a role for this additional n terminal sequence in this study the structure of the ak  from the cyanobacteria synechocystis reveals that this supplementary sequence is linked to the dimerization mode of aks its absence in ak  leads to the dimerization by the catalytic domain instead of involving the act domains pfam    small regulatory domains initially found in ak chorismate mutase and tyra prephenate dehydrogenase  as observed in ak  thus the structural analysis of the synechocystis ak  revealed a dimer with a novel architecture the four act domains of each monomer interact together and do not make any contact with those of the second monomer the enzyme is inhibited synergistically by threonine and lysine with the binding of threonine first the interaction between act and act or between act and act generates a threonine binding site and a lysine binding site at each interface making a total of eight regulatory sites per dimer and allowing a fine tuning of the ak activity by the end products threonine and lysine
