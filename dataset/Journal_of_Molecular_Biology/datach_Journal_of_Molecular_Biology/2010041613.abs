extended structures in rna folding intermediates are due to nonnative interactions rather than electrostatic repulsion
rna folding occurs via a series of transitions between metastable intermediate states for mg  concentrations below those needed to fold the native structure in general these folding intermediates are considerably less compact than their respective native states our previous work demonstrates that the major equilibrium intermediate of the   residue specificity domain s domain of the bacillus subtilis rnase p rna is more extended than its native structure we now investigate two models with falsifiable predictions regarding the origins of the extended intermediate structures in the s domains of the b subtilis and the escherichia coli rnase p rna that belong to different classes of p rna and have distinct native structures the first model explores the contribution of electrostatic repulsion while the second model probes specific interactions in the core of the folding intermediate using small angle x ray scattering and langevin dynamics simulations we show that electrostatics plays only a minor role whereas specific interactions largely account for the extended nature of the intermediate structural contacts in the core including a nonnative base pair help to stabilize the intermediate conformation we conclude that rna folding intermediates adopt extended conformations due to short range nonnative interactions rather than generic electrostatic repulsion of helical domains these principles apply to other ribozymes and riboswitches that undergo functionally relevant conformational changes
