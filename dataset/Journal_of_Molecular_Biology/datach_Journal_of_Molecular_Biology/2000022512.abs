design of nuclease resistant protein kinase c  dna enzymes with potential therapeutic application edited by j karn
for the therapeutic application of catalytic nucleic acids it is desirable to have small stable and inexpensive compounds that are active at physiological mg  concentrations we have explored the possibility of using the versatile     dna catalytic core to suppress the expression of the protein kinase c  pkc  isoform in malignant cells by introducing either a      inverted thymidine nucleotide or site specific phosphorothioate modification into a pkc  dna enzyme we have designed stable catalysts that retained a significant in vitro cleavage activity in particular a dna enzyme containing phosphorothioate analogues in the antisense arms and in the pyrimidine residues of the catalytic core was found to be remarkably stable in   human serum t   gt   hours and inhibited in vitro cell growth by up to   at nanomolar concentrations the inhibition of pkc  gene expression is sequence specific as a dna enzyme with reversed antisense arms was found to be ineffective epifluorescence microscopic analysis of cells transfected with a   fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated dna enzyme showed that the dna enzyme molecules are mainly localised in the nuclei most of the dna enzyme treated cells were killed by apoptosis the ability of the described pkc  dna enzymes to trigger apoptosis apoptozymes in malignant cells illustrates their therapeutic potential furthermore such agents can be a valuable tool for probing gene function
