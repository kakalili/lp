dynamic modulation of binding affinity as a mechanism for regulating interferon signaling
how structural dynamics affects cytokine signaling is under debate here we investigated the dynamics of the type i interferon ifn receptor ifnar  and its effect on signaling upon binding ifn and ifnar using a combination of structure based mechanistic studies in situ binding and gene induction assays our study reveals that ifnar flexibility modulates ligand binding affinity which in turn regulates biological signaling we identified the hinge sites and key interactions implicated in ifnar inter subdomain sd  sd  movements we showed that the predicted cooperative movements are essential to accommodate intermolecular interactions engineered disulfide bridges computationally predicted to interfere with ifnar dynamics were experimentally confirmed notably introducing disulfide bonds between subdomains sd and sd modulated ifn binding and activity in accordance with the relative attenuation of cooperative movements with varying distance from the hinge center whereas locking the sd  sd interface flexibility in favor of an extended conformer increased activity
