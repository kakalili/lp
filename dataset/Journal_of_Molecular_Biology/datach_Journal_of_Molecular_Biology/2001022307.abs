the human estrogen receptor  dimer binds a single src  coactivator molecule with an affinity dictated by agonist structure edited by k yamamoto
nuclear receptors act as ligand inducible transcription factors agonist binding leads to interaction with coactivator proteins and to the assembly of the general transcription machinery in addition to structural information a thorough understanding of transcriptional activation by the nuclear receptors requires the characterization of the thermodynamic parameters governing these protein protein interactions in this study we have quantitatively characterized the interactions of full length baculovirus expressed human estrogen receptor   er   as well as er  hormone binding domain erhbd with a fragment of the coactivator protein src  amino acid residues   to    fluorescence anisotropy and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy of fluorescently labeled src      demonstrate unambiguously that the stoichiometry of the src  er  estradiol complex is one coactivator molecule per er  dimer the affinity of the estradiol or estriol bound er  src  complexes was found to be significantly higher than that observed in the presence of estrone no binding was observed in the absence of ligand or in the presence of antagonists distinct anisotropy values for the er  src  complexes with different agonists suggest distinct conformations of the complexes depending upon agonist structure
