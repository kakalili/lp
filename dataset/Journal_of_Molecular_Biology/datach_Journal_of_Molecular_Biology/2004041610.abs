two homologous domains of similar structure but different stability in the yeast linker histone hho p
the saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue of the linker histone h  hho p has two domains that are similar in sequence to the globular domain of h  and variants such as h  it is an open question whether both domains are functional and whether they play similar structural roles preliminary structural studies showed that the two isolated domains gi and gii differ significantly in stability in  mm sodium phosphate ph   the gi domain like the globular domains of h and h  gh and gh  was stably folded whereas gii was largely unstructured however at high concentrations of large tetrahedral anions phosphate sulphate perchlorate  which might mimic the charge screening effects of dna phosphate groups gii was folded in view of the potential significance of these observations in relation to the role of hho p we have now determined the structures of its gi and gii domains by nmr spectroscopy under conditions in which gii like gi is folded the backbone r m s d over the ordered residues is    for gi and    for gii both structures show the  winged helix  fold typical of gh and gh and are very similar to each other with an r m s d over the structured regions of    although there are distinct differences the potential for gii to adopt a structure similar to that of gi when hho p is bound to chromatin in vivo suggests that both globular domains might be functional whether hho p performs a structural role by bridging two nucleosomes remains to be determined
