the conserved methionine residue of the metzincins a site directed mutagenesis study edited by r huber
the metalloprotease clan of the metzincins derive their name from the presence of a conserved methionine residue that is located on the c terminal side of the zinc binding consensus sequence hexxhxxgxxh this methionine residue is located in a rather divergent part of the primary sequence but is structurally very well conserved it is located under the pyramidal base of the three histidine residues that coordinate the catalytic zinc ion and is not involved in any direct contact with the metal nor the substrate in order to clarify its role this methionine residue m   of the protease c from erwinia chrysanthemi has been mutated to various other amino acids the mutants m  l m  a m  i were sufficiently stable to be isolated while the mutants m  h m  s and m  n could not be purified the kinetic properties of these mutants were analysed all mutants showed decreased activity whereby increases in km as well as decreases in kcat were observed the m  l mutant and m  c e  k double mutant which has the catalytic glutamic acid substituted as well could be crystallised the structure of the m  l mutant was determined to a resolution of    and refined to rfree of    the structure is isomorphous to the wild type and does not show large differences with the exception of a very small movement of the zinc liganding histidine residues the m  c e  k double mutant crystal structure has been refined to an rfree of   at    resolution a small rearrangement of the zinc liganding histidine residues can be detected which leads to a slightly different zinc coordination and could explain the decrease in activity
