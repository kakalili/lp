structural insights into nonspecific binding of dna by trmbl  an archaeal chromatin protein
the crystal structure of trmbl from the archaeon pyrococcus furiosus shows an association of two pseudosymmetric dimers the dimers follow the prototypical design of known bacterial repressors with two helix  turn  helix hth domains binding to successive major grooves of the dna however in trmbl  the two dimers are arranged at a mutual displacement of approximately bp so that they associate with the dna along the double helical axis at an angle of approximately   while the deoxyribose phosphate groups of the double stranded dna dsdna used for co crystallization are clearly seen in the electron density map most of the nucleobases are averaged out refinement required to assume a superposition of at least three mutually displaced dsdnas the hth domains interact primarily with the deoxyribose phosphate groups and polar interactions with the nucleobases are almost absent this hitherto unseen mode of dna binding by trmbl seems to arise from nonoptimal protein  dna contacts made by its four hth domains resulting in a low affinity nonspecific binding to dna
