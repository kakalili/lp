hemoglobin site mutants reveal dynamical role of interhelical h bonds in the allosteric pathway time resolved uv resonance raman evidence for intra dimer coupling
the dynamical effect of eliminating specific tertiary h bonds in the hemoglobin hb tetramer has been investigated by site directed mutagenesis and time resolved absorption and ultraviolet resonance raman uvrr spectroscopy the trp    thr   and trp    ser   h bonds connect the a and e helices in the  and  chains and are proposed to break in the earliest protein intermediate rdeoxy following photo deligation of hbco along with a second pair of h bonds involving tyrosine residues mutation of the acceptor residues thr   and ser   to val and ala eliminates the a  e h bonds but has been shown to have no significant effect on ligand binding affinity or cooperativity or on spectroscopic markers of the t state quaternary interactions however the mutations have profound and unexpected effects on the character of the rdeoxy intermediate and on the dynamics of the subsequent steps leading to the t state formation of the initial quaternary contact rt intermediate is accelerated by an order of magnitude but the locking in of the t state is delayed by a factor of  these rate effects are essentially the same for either mutation or for the double mutation suggesting that the   dimer behaves as a mechanically coupled dynamical unit further evidence for intra dimer coupling is provided by the rdeoxy uvrr spectrum in which either or both mutations eliminate the tyrosine difference intensity although only tryptophan h bonds are directly affected a possible mechanism for mechanical coupling is outlined involving transmission of forces through the     and     interface the present observations establish that quaternary motions can occur on the    ns time scale they show also that a full complement of interhelical h bonds actually slows the initial quaternary motion in hb but accelerates the locking in of the t contacts
