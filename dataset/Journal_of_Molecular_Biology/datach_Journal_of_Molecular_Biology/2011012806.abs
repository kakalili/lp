transposase  transposase interactions in mos complexes a biochemical approach
transposases are proteins that have assumed the mobility of class ii transposable elements in order to map the interfaces involved in transposase  transposase interactions we have taken advantage of  transposase mutants that impair mariner transposase  transposase interactions taking place during transposition our data indicate that transposase  transposase interactions regulating mos transposition are sophisticated and result from i active mos dimerization through the first hth of the n terminal domain which leads to inverted terminal repeat itr binding  ii inactive dimerization carried by part of the c terminal domain which prevents itr binding and iii oligomerization inactive dimers are nonpermissive in organizing complexes that produce itr binding but the interfaces or interactions supplied in this state could play a role in the various rearrangements needed during transposition oligomerization is probably not due to a specific mos domain but rather the result of nonspecific interactions resulting from incorrect folding of the protein our data also suggest that the mos catalytic domain is a main actor in the overall organization of mos  thus playing a role in mos oligomerization finally we propose that mos behaves as predicted by the pre equilibrium existing model whereby proteins are found to exist simultaneously in populations with diverse conformations monomers and active and inactive dimers for mos  we were able to identify several mos mutants that modify this pre existing equilibrium according to their properties some of these mutants will be useful tools to break down the remaining gaps in our understanding of mariner transposition
