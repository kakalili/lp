functional characterization of the escherichia coli fis  dna binding sequence
the escherichia coli protein fis is remarkable for its ability to interact specifically with dna sites of highly variable sequences the mechanism of this sequence flexible dna recognition is not well understood in a previous study we examined the contributions of fis residues to high affinity binding at different dna sequences using alanine scanning mutagenesis and identified several key residues for fis  dna recognition in this work we investigated the contributions of the  bp core fis binding sequence and its flanking regions to fis  dna interactions systematic base pair replacements made in both half sites of a palindromic fis binding sequence were examined for their effects on the relative fis binding affinity missing contact assays were also used to examine the effects of base removal within the core binding site and its flanking regions on the fis  dna binding affinity the results revealed that   the   g and  y bases in both dna strands relative to the central position of the core binding site are major determinants for high affinity binding   the c methyl group of thymine when present at the  position strongly hinders fis binding and   at rich sequences in the central and flanking dna regions facilitate fis  dna interactions by altering the dna structure and by increasing the local dna flexibility we infer that the degeneracy of specific fis binding sites results from the numerous base pair combinations that are possible at noncritical dna positions from   to    from   to   and from  to   with only moderate penalties on the binding affinity the roughly similar contributions of   a or g and  t or c to the binding affinity and the minimal requirement of three of the four critical base pairs to achieve considerably high binding affinities
