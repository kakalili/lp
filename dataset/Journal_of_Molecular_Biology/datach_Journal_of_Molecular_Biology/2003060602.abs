dynamics and dna substrate recognition by the catalytic domain of lambda integrase
bacteriophage lambda integrase   int is the prototypical member of a large family of enzymes that catalyze site specific dna recombination via the formation of a holliday junction intermediate dna strand cleavage by  int is mediated by nucleophilic attack on the scissile phosphate by a conserved tyrosine residue forming an intermediate with the enzyme covalently attached to the   end of the cleaved strand via a phosphotyrosine linkage the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of  int c   obtained in the absence of dna revealed the tyrosine nucleophile at the protein s c terminus to be located on a  hairpin far from the other conserved catalytic residues and adjacent to a disordered loop this observation suggested that a conformational change in the c terminus of the protein was required to generate the active site in cis or alternatively that the active site could be completed in trans by donation of the tyrosine nucleophile from a neighboring molecule in the recombining synapse we used nmr spectroscopy together with limited proteolysis to examine the dynamics of the  int catalytic domain in the presence and absence of dna half site substrates with the goal of characterizing the expected conformational change although the c terminus is indeed flexible in the absence of dna we find that conformational changes in the tyrosine containing  hairpin are not coupled to dna binding to gain structural insights into c  dna complexes we took advantage of mechanistic conservation with cre and flp recombinases to model c  in half site and tetrameric holliday junction complexes although the models do not reveal the nature of the conformational change required for cis cleavage they are consistent with much of the available experimental data and provide new insights into the how trans complementation could be accommodated
