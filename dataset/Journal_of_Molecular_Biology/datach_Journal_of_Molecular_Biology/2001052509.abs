essential dynamics of reversible peptide folding memory free conformational dynamics governed by internal hydrogen bonds edited by r huber
a principal component analysis has been applied on equilibrium simulations of a  heptapeptide that shows reversible folding in a methanol solution the analysis shows that the configurational space contains only three dense sub states these states of relatively low free energy correspond to the  native  left handed helix a partly helical intermediate and a hairpin like structure the collection of unfolded conformations form a relatively diffuse cloud with little substructure internal hydrogen bonding energies were found to correlate well with the degree of folding the native helical structure folds from the n terminus the transition from the major folding intermediate to the native helical structure involves the formation of the two most c terminal backbone hydrogen bonds a four state markov model was found to describe transition frequencies between the conformational states within error limits indicating that memory effects are negligible beyond the nanosecond time scale the dominant native state fluctuations were found to be very similar to unfolding motions suggesting that unfolding pathways can be inferred from fluctuations in the native state the low dimensional essential subspace describing   of the collective atomic fluctuations was found to converge at time scales of the order of one nanosecond at all temperatures investigated whereas folding unfolding takes place at significantly longer time scales even above the melting temperature
