crystal structure of a core domain of stomatin from pyrococcus horikoshii illustrates a novel trimeric and coiled coil fold
stomatin is a major integral membrane protein of human erythrocytes the absence of which is associated with a form of hemolytic anemia known as hereditary stomatocytosis however the function of stomatin is not fully understood an open reading frame ph   from the hyperthermophilic archaeon pyrococcus horikoshii encodes p stomatin a prokaryotic stomatin here we report the first crystal structure of a stomatin ortholog the core domain of the p stomatin ph  p residues     of ph  p designated as phstocd  phstocd forms a novel homotrimeric structure three    domains form a triangle of about    on each side and three  helical segments of about    in length extend from the apexes of the triangle the    domain of phstocd is partly similar in structure to the band  domain of mouse flotillin  while the    domain is relatively rigid the  helical segment shows conformational flexibility adapting to the neighboring environment one  helical segment forms an anti parallel coiled coil with another  helical segment from a symmetry related molecule the  helical segment shows a heptad repeat pattern and mainly hydrophobic residues form a coiled coil interface according to chemical cross linking experiments phstocd would be able to assemble into an oligomeric form the coiled coil fold observed in the crystal probably contributes to self association
