the peptidyl prolyl isomerase pin interacts with hspt phosphorylated by cdk  edited j karn
we identify and characterize several phosphorylated forms of the hspt subunit of the drb sensitivity inducing factor dsif  a   kda phosphorylated form of hspt is bound to nuclei of interphase hela cells this form is rapidly dephosphorylated when cultured cells are exposed to various drugs belonging to distinct chemical families all these compounds are known to inhibit the protein kinase cdk  which phosphorylates in vitro hspt and rpb  the largest subunit of rna polymerase ii the efficiency to promote the dephosphorylation of both proteins matches their capacity to inhibit purified cdk kinase suggesting that cdk is the major kinase phosphorylating hspt and rpb in vivo we show that cdk phosphorylates both the ctr and the ctr domains of recombinant hspt  these domains contain numerous serine proline and threonine proline residues similar to those found in the carboxyl terminal domain ctd of rpb  the structural homology between hspt ctrs and the rpb ctd is further highlighted by the presence on both proteins of a phosphoepitope recognized by the monoclonal antibody cc  of particular interest the peptidyl prolyl isomerase pin interacts with cdk phosphorylated hspt  cdk dependent phosphorylation of rpb and hspt followed by pin interaction might thus contribute to the regulation of transcription pre mrna maturation and the dynamics of these proteins in interphase and mitosis
