a mutation in the c terminal domain of the rna polymerase alpha subunit that destabilizes the open complexes formed at the phage   late a promoter edited by i b holland
regulatory protein p from bacillus subtilis phage   activates the viral late a promoter mainly by stabilizing the binding of rna polymerase rnap to it as a closed complex this requires an interaction between protein p residue arg  and the c terminal domain ctd of the rnap  subunit several acidic residues of the  ctd considered as plausible targets for p residue arg   were individually changed into alanine in addition a truncated  subunit lacking the last four residues two of which are acidic was obtained the modified  subunits were purified and reconstituted into rnap holoenzyme in vitro protein p was found to be unable to activate the late a promoter when residue glu  of the  subunit was changed to ala a modification that did not impair transcription from several other promoters interestingly protein p could stabilize the modified rnap at the a promoter as a closed complex although the open complexes formed were unstable and did not proceed to elongation complexes our results indicate that the change of the  residue glu  into ala destabilizes the open complexes formed at this promoter but not at other promoters considered in the context of earlier findings indicating that the rnap  ctd may participate in the transition from closed to intermediate complexes at some other promoters the new results expand and clarify our view of its role in transcription initiation
