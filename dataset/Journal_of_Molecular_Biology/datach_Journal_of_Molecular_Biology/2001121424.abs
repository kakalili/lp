archaeal rada protein binds dna as both helical filaments and octameric rings edited by m belfort
the escherichia coli reca protein has been a model for understanding homologous eukaryotic recombination proteins such as rad  the active form of both reca and rad  appear to be helical filaments polymerized on dna in which an unusual helical structure is induced in the dna surprisingly the human meiosis specific homolog of reca dmc  has thus far only been observed to bind dna as an octameric ring sequence analysis and biochemical studies have shown that archaeal rada proteins are more closely related to rad  and dmc than the bacterial reca proteins we find that the sulfolobus solfataricus rada protein binds dna in the absence of nucleotide cofactor as an octameric ring and in the presence of atp as a helical filament since it is likely that rada is closely related to a common ancestral protein of both rad  and dmc  the two dna binding forms of rada may provide insight into the divergence that has taken place between rad  and dmc
