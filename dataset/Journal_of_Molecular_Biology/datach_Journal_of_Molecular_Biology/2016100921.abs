structural conservation and e f binding specificity within the retinoblastoma pocket protein family
the human pocket proteins retinoblastoma rb  p   and p  are critical negative regulators of the cell cycle and contribute to tumor suppression while strong structural conservation within the pocket protein family provides for some functional redundancy important differences have been observed and may underlie the reason that rb is a uniquely potent tumor suppressor it has been proposed that distinct pocket protein activities are mediated by their different e f transcription factor binding partners in humans rb binds e f  e f  whereas p  and p  almost exclusively associate with e f and e f  to identify the molecular determinants of this specificity we compared the crystal structures of rb and p  pocket domains and identified several key residues that contribute to e f selectivity in the pocket family mutation of these residues in p  to match the analogous residue in rb results in an increase in affinity for e f and e f and an increase in the ability of p  to inhibit e f transactivation additionally we investigated how phosphorylation by cyclin dependent kinase on distinct residues regulates p  affinity for the e f transactivation domain we found that phosphorylation of residues s  and s  weakens the e f transactivation domain binding our data reveal molecular features of pocket proteins that are responsible for their similarities and differences in function and regulation
