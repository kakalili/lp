DNA topoisomerases catalyze the inter-conversion of different topological forms of DNA. While all type II DNA topoisomerases relax supercoiled DNA, DNA gyrase is the only enyzme that introduces negative supercoils into DNA at the expense of ATP hydrolysis.We present here a biophysical characterization of the nucleotide cycle of DNA gyrase from Bacillus subtilis, both in the absence and presence of DNA. B. subtilis DNA gyrase is highly homologous to its well-studied Escherichia coli counterpart, but exhibits unique mechanistic features. The active heterotetramer of B. subtilis DNA gyrase is formed by mixing the GyrA and GyrB subunits. GyrB undergoes nucleotide-induced dimerization and is an ATP-operated clamp. The intrinsic ATPase activity of gyrase is stimulated tenfold in the presence of plasmid DNA. However, in contrast to the E. coli homolog, the rate-limiting step in the nucleotide cycle of B. subtilis GyrB is ATP hydrolysis, not product dissociation or an associated conformational change. Furthermore, there is no cooperativity between the two DNA and ATP binding sites in B. subtilis DNA gyrase. Nevertheless, the enzyme is as efficient in negative supercoiling as the E. coli DNA gyrase.Our results provide evidence that the evolutionary goal of efficient DNA supercoiling can be realized by similar architecture, but differences in the underlying mechanism. The basic mechanistic features are conserved among DNA gyrases, but the kinetics of individual steps can vary significantly even between closely related enzymes. This suggests that each topoisomerase represents a different solution to the complex reaction sequence in DNA supercoiling.
