crystal structure of the frizzled like cysteine rich domain of the receptor tyrosine kinase musk
muscle specific kinase musk is an essential receptor tyrosine kinase for the establishment and maintenance of the neuromuscular junction nmj  activation of musk by agrin a neuronally derived heparan sulfate proteoglycan and lrp  low density lipoprotein receptor related protein   the agrin receptor leads to clustering of acetylcholine receptors on the postsynaptic side of the nmj the ectodomain of musk comprises three immunoglobulin like domains and a cysteine rich domain fz crd related to those in frizzled proteins the receptors for wnts here we report the crystal structure of the musk fz crd at     resolution the structure reveals a five disulfide bridged domain similar to crds of frizzled proteins but with a divergent c terminal region an asymmetric dimer present in the crystal structure implicates surface hydrophobic residues that may function in homotypic or heterotypic interactions to mediate co clustering of musk rapsyn and acetylcholine receptors at the nmj
