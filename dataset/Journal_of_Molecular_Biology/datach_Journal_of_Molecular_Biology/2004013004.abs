ribosomal protein dependent orientation of the  s rrna environment of s
ribosomal protein s  binds specifically to the central domain of  s ribosomal rna  s rrna and directs the assembly of four additional proteins to this domain the central domain of  s rrna along with these five proteins form the platform of the  s subunit previously directed hydroxyl radical probing from fe ii s  in small ribonucleoprotein complexes was used to study assembly of the central domain of  s rrna here this same approach was used to understand the  s rrna environment of fe ii s  in  s subunits and to determine the ribosomal proteins that are involved in forming the mature s   s rrna environment we have identified additional sites of fe ii s  directed cleavage in  s subunits compared to the binary complex of fe ii s   s rrna along with novel targets in the central domain sites within the   and   minor domains are also cleaved this suggests that during the course of  s subunit assembly these elements are positioned in the vicinity of s  besides the previously determined role for s  roles for s  s s  and s  in altering the  s rrna environment of s  were established these studies reveal that ribosomal proteins can alter the assembly of regions of the  s subunit from a considerable distance and influence the overall conformation of this ribonucleoprotein particle
