caspase  specificity probed at subsite s crystal structure of the caspase  z devd cho complex edited by r huber
caspase  is an initiator enzyme in the fas mediated pathway of which the downstream executioner caspase  is a physiological target caspases are cysteine proteases that are specific for substrates with an aspartic acid residue at the p position and have an optimal recognition motif that incorporates four amino acid residues n terminal to the cleavage site caspase  has been classified as a group iii caspase member because it shows a preference for a small hydrophobic residue at the p substrate position we report the x ray crystallographic structure of caspase  in complex with benzyloxycarbonyl asp glu val asp aldehyde z devd  a specific group ii caspase inhibitor the structure shows that the inhibitor interacts favourably with the enzyme in subsite s  kinetic data reveal that z devd ki  nm is an almost equally potent inhibitor of caspase  as the specific group iii inhibitor boc ietd aldehyde ki  nm  in view of this finding the original classification of caspases into three specificity groups needs to be modified at least for caspase  which tolerates small hydrophobic residues as well as the acidic residue asp in subsite s  we propose that the subsite s must be considered as an important specificity determining factor
