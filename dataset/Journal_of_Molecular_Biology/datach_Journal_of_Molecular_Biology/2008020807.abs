threonine   of escherichia coli   is a key participant in promoter dna melting by rna polymerase
initiation of transcription is an important target for regulation of gene expression in bacteria the formation of a transcription competent complex between rna polymerase and a promoter involves dna strand separation over a stretch of about   base pairs aromatic and basic residues in conserved region   of escherichia coli   had been found to participate in this process but it is still unclear which amino acid residues initiate it here we report an essential role for threonine t at position   of    its substitution by alanine t  a results in the largest decrease in open complex formation yet observed for any single substitution in region   promoter recognition itself is not affected by t  a substitution thus providing evidence for a role of t  in the strand separation step our data are consistent with a model where the t  would act as a competitor for the hydrogen bonding that stabilizes the highly conserved   a t base pairs of the promoter dna thus facilitating initiation of strand separation at this particular position in the    region this model suggests an active role for rna polymerase in disrupting the    base pair rather than just capturing the   a subsequent to spontaneous unpairing
