a small reservoir of disabled orfs in the yeast genome and its implications for the dynamics of proteome evolution edited by f cohen
we surveyed the sequenced saccharomyces cerevisiae genome strain s  c comprehensively for open reading frames orfs that could encode full length proteins but contain obvious mid sequence disablements frameshifts or premature stop codons  these pseudogenic features are termed disabled orfs dorfs  using homology to annotated yeast orfs and non yeast proteins plus a simple region extension procedure we have found   dorfs combined with the  existing annotations for potential dorfs we have a total pool of up to   dorfs corresponding to less than    of the proteome additionally we found  pairs of annotated orfs for yeast that could be merged into a single orf termed a morf by read through of the intervening stop codon and may comprise a complete orf in other yeast strains focussing on a core pool of  dorfs with a verifying protein homology we find that most dorfs are substantially decayed with     having two or more disablements and     having four or more dorfs are much more yeast proteome specific than live yeast genes having about half the chance that they are related to a non yeast protein  they show a dramatically increased density at the telomeres of chromosomes relative to genes a microarray study shows that some dorfs are expressed even though they carry multiple disablements and thus may be more resistant to nonsense mediated decay many of the dorfs may be involved in responding to environmental stresses as the largest functional groups include growth inhibition flocculation and the srp tip family our results have important implications for proteome evolution the characteristics of the dorf population suggest the sorts of genes that are likely to fall in and out of usage and vary in copy number in a strain specific way and highlight the role of subtelomeric regions in engendering this diversity our results also have important implications for the effects of the psi  prion the dorfs disabled by only a single stop and the morfs together totalling   provide an estimate for the extent of the sequence population that can be resurrected readily through the demonstrated ability of the psi  prion to cause nonsense codon read through also the dorfs and morfs that we find have properties e g growth inhibition flocculation vanadate resistance stress response that are potentially related to the ability of psi  to engender substantial phenotypic variation in yeast strains under different environmental conditions  see genecensus org pseudogene for further information
