the axial  helices and radial spokes in the core of the cryo negatively stained complex flagellar filament of pseudomonas rhodos recovering high resolution details from a flexible helical assembly
of the two known  complex  flagellar filaments those of pseudomonas are far more flexible than those of rhizobium their diameter is larger and their outer three start ridges and grooves are more prominent although the symmetry of both complex filaments is similar the polymer s linear mass density and the flagellin molecular mass of the latter are lower a recent comparison of a three dimensional reconstruction of the filament of pseudomonas rhodos to that of rhizobium lupini indicates that the outer flagellin domain d  is missing in r lupini here we concentrate on the structure of the inner core of the filament of p rhodos using field emission cryo negative staining electron microscopy and a hybrid helical single particle reconstruction technique averaging   filaments caused the density band corresponding to the radial spokes to nearly average out due to their variability and inferred flexibility treating the z  cross sections through the aligned individual three dimensional density maps as images classifying them by correspondence analysis using a mask containing the radial spokes domain and re averaging the subclasses using helical reconstruction techniques allowed a recovery of the radial spokes and resolved the  helices in domain d and the triple  helical bundles in domain d at a resolution of      although the perturbed components of the helical lattice are present along the entire filament s radius the interior of the complex filament is similar to that of the plain one whereas it s exterior is altered reconstructions of vitrified and cryo negatively stained plain right handed filaments of salmonella typhimurium sjw   prepared and imaged under conditions identical with those used for p rhodos confirm the similarity of their inner cores and that the secondary structures in the interior of the flagellar filament can under critical conditions of image recording and correction be resolved in negative stain
