extremely thermophilic translation system in the common ancestor commonote ancestral mutants of glycyl trna synthetase from the extreme thermophile thermus thermophilus
based on phylogenetic analysis of  s and  s rrnas the common ancestor of all organisms commonote was proposed to be hyperthermophilic we have previously tested this hypothesis using enzymes with ancestral residues that are inferred by molecular phylogenetic analysis the ancestral mutant enzymes involved in metabolic systems show higher thermal stability than wild type enzymes consistent with the hyperthermophile common ancestor hypothesis here we have extended the experiments to include an enzyme of the translation system glycyl trna synthetase glyrs  the translation system often shows a phylogenetic tree that is similar to the rrna tree thus it is likely that the tree represents the evolutionary route of the organisms the maximum likelihood tree of   type glyrs was constructed from this analysis the ancestral sequence of glyrs was deduced and individual or pairs of ancestral residues were introduced into thermus thermophilus glyrs the ancestral mutants were expressed in escherichia coli purified and activity measured the thermostability of eight mutated proteins was evaluated by cd circular dichroism measurements six mutants showed higher thermostability than wild type enzyme and seven mutants showed higher activity than wild type enzyme at    c suggesting an extremely thermophilic translation system in the common ancestor commonote
