ferredoxin nadp reductase from plasmodium falciparum undergoes nadp dependent dimerization and inactivation functional and crystallographic analysis
the completion of the plasmodium falciparum genome sequence has recently promoted the search for new antimalarial drugs more specifically metabolic pathways of the apicoplast a key organelle for survival of the parasite have been recognized as potential targets for the development of specific new antimalarial agents as most apicomplexan parasites p falciparum displays a plant type ferredoxin nadp reductase yielding reduced ferredoxin for essential biosynthetic pathways in the apicoplast here we report a molecular kinetic and ligand binding characterization of the recombinant ferredoxin nadp reductase from p falciparum in the light of current data available for plant ferredoxin nadp reductases in parallel with the functional characterization we describe the crystal structures of p falciparum ferredoxin nadp reductase in free form and in complex with   phospho amp at   and     resolution respectively  the enzyme displays structural properties likely to be unique to plasmodial reductases in particular the two crystal structures highlight a covalent dimer which relies on the oxidation of residue cys  in two opposing subunits and a helix  coil transition that occurs in the nadp binding domain triggered by   phospho amp binding studies in solution show that nadp  as well as   phospho amp promotes the formation of the disulfide stabilized dimer the isolated dimer is essentially inactive but full activity is recovered upon disulfide reduction the occurrence of residues unique to the plasmodial enzyme and the discovery of specific conformational properties highlight the nadp binding domain of p falciparum ferredoxin nadp reductase as particularly suited for the rational development of antimalarial compounds
