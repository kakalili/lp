orientation of the  s regulator relative to the  s core proteasome an immunoelectron microscopic study
specific labelling with monoclonal antibodies reveals that in regulator proteasome complexes the asymmetric  s regulator pa   binds to one or both terminal  disks of the cylinder shaped  s core proteasome in such a way that its reclining front part is positioned in the vicinity of proteasome subunit   the protruding rear part of the regulator appears to be situated distal to the sites occupied by the subunits   and   respectively when viewed from      to      along the polar  fold axis of the  s proteasome core the rear part of each  s regulator cap appears to protrude clockwise thus a defined alignment of the  s regulator with respect to the single polar  fold rotational axis of the  s core proteasome is obtained
