projection structure of the monomeric porin ompg at   resolution edited by w baumeister
the escherichia coli porin ompg which acts as an efficient unspecific channel for mono  di and trisaccharides has been purified and crystallized in two dimensions projection maps of two different crystal forms of ompg at   resolution show that the protein has a  barrel structure characteristic for outer membrane proteins and that it does not form trimers unlike most other porins such as ompf and ompc but appears in monomeric form the size of the barrel is    nm indicating that ompg may consist of    strands the projection map suggests that the channel is restricted by internal loops
