the structure of interleukin  reveals the molecular basis of p  subunit sharing with interleukin
interleukin il   is a recently identified member of the il  family of heterodimeric cytokines that modulate subpopulations of t helper cells and both il  and il  are attractive targets for therapy of autoimmune diseases il  is a binary complex of a four helix bundle cytokine p  and a soluble class i cytokine receptor p  il  and il  share p  as an  receptor subunit yet show only   sequence homology between their four helix cytokines p  and p  respectively and signal through different combinations of shared receptors in order to elucidate the structural basis of p  sharing we have determined a    crystal structure of il  for comparison to the previously determined structure of il   the docking mode of p  to p  is altered compared to p  deviating by a  tilt  and  roll  that results in an altered footprint of p  on the a and d helices of the respective cytokines binding of p  to p  is mediated primarily by an arginine residue on helix d of p  that forms an extensive charge and hydrogen bonding network with residues at the base of a pocket on p  this  arginine pocket  is lined with an inner shell of hydrophobic interactions that are ringed by an outer shell of polar interactions comparative analysis indicates that the il  and il  complexes  mimic  the network of interactions constituting the central arginine pocket despite p  and p  having limited sequence homology the majority of the structural epitopes in the two complexes are composed of unique p  and p  pairwise contacts with common residues on p  thus while the critical hotspot is maintained in the two complexes the majority of the interfaces are structurally distinct and therefore provide a basis for the therapeutic targeting of il  versus il  heterodimer formation despite their use of a common receptor subunit
