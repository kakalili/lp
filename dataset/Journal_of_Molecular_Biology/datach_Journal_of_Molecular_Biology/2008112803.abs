thermodynamics kinetics and salt dependence of folding of yopm a large leucine rich repeat protein
small globular proteins have many contacts between residues that are distant in primary sequence these contacts create a complex network between sequence distant segments of secondary structure which may be expected to promote the cooperative folding of globular proteins although repeat proteins which are composed of tandem modular units lack sequence distant contacts several of considerable length have been shown to undergo cooperative two state folding to explore the limits of cooperativity in repeat proteins we have studied the unfolding of yopm a leucine rich repeat lrr protein of over   residues despite its large size and modular architecture   repeats  yopm equilibrium unfolding is highly cooperative and shows a very strong dependence on the concentration of urea in contrast kinetic studies of yopm folding indicate a mechanism that includes one or more transient intermediates the urea dependence of the folding and unfolding rates suggests a relatively small transition state ensemble as with the urea dependence we have found an extreme dependence of the free energy of unfolding on the concentration of salt this salt dependence likely results from general screening of a large number of unfavorable columbic interactions in the folded state rather than from specific cation binding
