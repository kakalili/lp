structural characterization of the rod cgmp phosphodiesterase
rod cgmp phosphodiesterase  pde  is a key enzyme of the phototransduction cascade consisting of pde   pde   and two regulatory pde  subunits pde is membrane associated through isoprenyl membrane anchors attached to the c termini of pde  and pde  and can form a complex with prenyl binding protein   prbp   an isoprenyl binding protein that is highly expressed in photoreceptors the stoichiometry of pde  prbp  binding and the mechanism by which the pde  prbp  complex assembles have not been fully characterized and the location of regulatory pde  subunits within the protein assembly has not been elucidated to clarify these questions we have developed a rapid purification method for pde  prbp  from bovine rod outer segments utilizing recombinant prbp   transmission electron microscopy of negatively stained samples revealed the location of prbp  and thus where the carboxyl termini of pde  and pde  must be located the three dimensional structure of the pde    complex was determined up to    resolution from single particle projections and was interpreted by model building to identify the probable location of isoprenylation pde  subunits and catalytic sites
