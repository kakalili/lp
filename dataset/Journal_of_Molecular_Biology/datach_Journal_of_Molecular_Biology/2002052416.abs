contrasting igg structures reveal extreme asymmetry and flexibility
the crystal structure of igg b  represents the first visualization of an intact human igg with a full length hinge that has all domains ordered and visible in comparison to intact murine antibodies and hinge deletant human antibodies b  reveals extreme asymmetry indicative of the extraordinary interdomain flexibility within an antibody in addition the structure provides an illustration of the human igg hinge in its entirety and of asymmetry in the composition of the carbohydrate attached to each ch domain of the fc the two separate hinges assume different conformations in order to accommodate the vastly different placements of the two fab domains relative to the fc domain interestingly only one of two possible intra hinge disulfides is formed
