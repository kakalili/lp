mapping the resistance potential of influenza s h channel against an antiviral blocker
the development of drug resistance has long plagued our efforts to curtail viral infections in general and influenza in particular the problem is particularly challenging since the exact mode of resistance may be difficult to predict without waiting for untreatable strains to evolve herein a different approach is taken using a novel genetic screen we map the resistance options of influenza s m channel against its aminoadamantane antiviral inhibitors in the process we could identify clinically known resistant mutations in a completely unbiased manner additionally novel mutations were obtained which while known to exist in circulating viruses were not previously classified as drug resistant finally we demonstrated the approach against an anti influenza drug that has not seen clinical use identifying several resistance mutations in the process in conclusion we present and employ a method to predict the resistance options of influenza s m channel to antiviral agents ahead of clinical use and without medical hazard
