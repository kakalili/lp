role of native topology investigated by multiple unfolding simulations of four sh domains edited by b honig
the relative importance of amino acid sequence and native topology in the unfolding process of two sh domains and two circular permutants was investigated by   molecular dynamics runs at   k for a total simulation time of    s the  spectrin ash  and src sh  ssh  domains which have the same topology and a sequence identity of only    show similar unfolding pathways the disappearance of the three stranded antiparallel  sheet is the last unfolding event in agreement with a large repertoire of kinetic data derived from point mutations as well as glycine insertions and disulfide crosslinks two alternative routes of  sheet unfolding have emerged from the analysis of the trajectories one is statistically preferred in ash  n src loop breaks before distal hairpin and the inverse in ssh  an elongation of the     hairpin was observed during the unfolding of ssh at   k and in   k simulations started from the putative transition state of ssh in accord with unusual kinetic data for point mutations at the n src loop the change of connectivity in the permutants influenced the sequence of unfolding events mainly at the permutation site regions where the connectivity remained unaffected showed the same chronology of contact disappearance taken together with previous folding simulations of two designed three stranded antiparallel  sheet peptides these results indicate that at least for small  sheet proteins the folding mechanism is primarily defined by the native state topology whilst specific interactions determine the statistically predominant folding route
