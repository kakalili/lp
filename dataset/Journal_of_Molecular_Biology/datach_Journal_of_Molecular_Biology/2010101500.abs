optimal packaging of fiv genomic rna depends upon a conserved long range interaction and a palindromic sequence within gag
the feline immunodeficiency virus fiv is a lentivirus that is related to human immunodeficiency virus hiv  causing a similar pathology in cats it is a potential small animal model for aids and the fiv based vectors are also being pursued for human gene therapy previous studies have mapped the fiv packaging signal   to two or more discontinuous regions within the     nt of the genomic rna and structural analyses have determined its secondary structure the   and   sequences within  region interact through extensive long range interactions lris  including a conserved heptanucleotide interaction between r u and gag other secondary structural elements identified include a conserved   nt stem  loop sl  and a small palindromic stem  loop within gag open reading frame that might act as a viral dimerization initiation site we have performed extensive mutational analysis of these sequences and structures and ascertained their importance in fiv packaging using a trans complementation assay disrupting the conserved heptanucleotide lri to prevent base pairing between r u and gag reduced packaging by      fold restoration of pairing using an alternative non wild type wt lri sequence restored rna packaging and propagation to wt levels suggesting that it is the structure of the lri rather than its sequence that is important for fiv packaging disrupting the palindrome within gag reduced packaging by     fold but substitution with a different palindromic sequence did not restore packaging completely suggesting that the sequence of this region as well as its palindromic nature is important mutation of individual regions of sl did not have a pronounced effect on fiv packaging suggesting that either it is the structure of sl as a whole that is necessary for optimal packaging or that there is redundancy within this structure the mutational analysis presented here has further validated the previously predicted rna secondary structure of fiv
