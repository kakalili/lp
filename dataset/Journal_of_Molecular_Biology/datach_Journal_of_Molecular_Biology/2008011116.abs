plasticity within the obligatory folding nucleus of an immunoglobulin like domain
a number of  sandwich immunoglobulin like domains have been shown to fold using a set of structurally equivalent residues that form a folding nucleus deep within the core of the protein formation of this nucleus is sufficient to establish the complex greek key topology of the native state these nucleating residues are highly conserved within the immunoglobulin superfamily but are less well conserved in the fibronectin type iii fniii superfamily where the requirement is simply to have four interacting hydrophobic residues however there are rare examples where this nucleation pattern is absent in this study we have investigated the folding of a novel member of the fniii superfamily whose nucleus appears to lack one of the four buried hydrophobic residues we show that the folding mechanism is unaltered but the folding nucleus has moved within the hydrophobic core
