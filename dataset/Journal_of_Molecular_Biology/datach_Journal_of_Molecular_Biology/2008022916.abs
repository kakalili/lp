characterization of domain  peptide interaction interface a case study on the amphiphysin  sh domain
many important protein  protein interactions are mediated by peptide recognition modular domains such as the src homology  sh  sh  pdz and ww domains characterizing the interaction interface of domain  peptide complexes and predicting binding specificity for modular domains are critical for deciphering protein  protein interaction networks here we propose the use of an energetic decomposition analysis to characterize domain  peptide interactions and the molecular interaction energy components miecs  including van der waals electrostatic and desolvation energy between residue pairs on the binding interface we show a proof of concept study on the amphiphysin  sh domain interacting with its peptide ligands the structures of the human amphiphysin  sh domain complexed with   peptides were first modeled using virtual mutagenesis and optimized by molecular mechanics mm minimization next the miecs between domain and peptide residues were computed using the mm generalized born decomposition analysis we conducted two types of statistical analyses on the miecs to demonstrate their usefulness for predicting binding affinities of peptides and for classifying peptides into binder and non binder categories first combining partial least squares analysis and genetic algorithm we fitted linear regression models between the miecs and the peptide binding affinities on the training data set these models were then used to predict binding affinities for peptides in the test data set the predicted values have a correlation coefficient of   and an unsigned mean error of   compared with the experimentally measured ones the partial least squares  genetic algorithm analysis on the miecs revealed the critical interactions for the binding specificity of the amphiphysin  sh domain next a support vector machine svm was employed to build classification models based on the miecs of peptides in the training set a rigorous training validation procedure was used to assess the performances of different kernel functions in svm and different combinations of the miecs the best svm classifier gave satisfactory predictions for the test set indicated by average prediction accuracy rates of   and   for the binding and non binding peptides respectively we also showed that the performance of our approach on both binding affinity prediction and binder non binder classification was superior to the performances of the conventional mm poisson  boltzmann solvent accessible surface area and mm generalized born solvent accessible surface area calculations our study demonstrates that the analysis of the miecs between peptides and the sh domain can successfully characterize the binding interface and it provides a framework to derive integrated prediction models for different domain  peptide systems
