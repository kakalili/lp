identification of amino acid residues of transcription factor ap  involved in dna binding edited by m yaniv
ap  is a cell type specific developmentally regulated transcription factor which has been described as a critical regulator of gene expression during vertebrate development and embryogenesis although the overall domains of this factor necessary for their activity have been identified the exact identity of ap  amino acid residues responsible for its interaction with the dna structure has not yet been described here we describe the identification of a region of ap  which was protected by an oligonucleotide probe containing its binding site from trypsin digestion monitored by peptide mapping by maldi tof mass spectrometry furthermore we analyzed the relative in vitro dna binding activity the stimulatory potency on the ap  dependent apoe promoter as well as the ability to inhibit the effect of the wild type protein of each one of a set of single site substitution ap  mutants spanning the identified region taken together our data clearly demonstrate that the region between amino acid residues     of ap  is essential for its dna binding activity particularly the individual substitution in any of the residues          or   is sufficient for completely abolishing the interaction with dna and the stimulation of apoe promoter activity these results indicate a crucial role of this region in the formation of an active dna binding domain and strongly suggest that these residues provide direct contacts with the dna structure at the ap  binding site
