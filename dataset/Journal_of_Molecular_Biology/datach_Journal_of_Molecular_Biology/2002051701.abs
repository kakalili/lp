identification and structure of a putative ca  binding domain at the c terminus of aqp
aquaporin  aqp  is the first functionally identified aquaporin of a growing family of membrane water channels found in all forms of life recently a possible secondary function as a cyclic guanosine monophosphate cgmp gated ion channel was attributed to aqp  we have reconstituted purified protein from bovine and human red blood cell membranes into highly ordered d crystals the topography of both aqp s was determined by electron microscopy from freeze dried unidirectionally metal shadowed d crystals as well as from surface topographs of native crystals recorded in buffer solution with the atomic force microscope afm  in spite of the high level of sequence homology between bovine and human aqp  the surfaces showed distinct differences alignment of both sequences and comparison of the acquired surface topographies with the atomic model of human aqp revealed the topographic changes on the surface of bovine aqp to be induced by a few amino acid substitutions a striking degree of sequence homology was found between the carboxyl terminal domains of aqp s from different organisms and ef hands from ca  binding proteins belonging to the calmodulin superfamily suggesting the existence of a ca  binding site at the c terminus of aqp instead of the putative cgmp binding site reported previously to unveil its position on the acquired surface topographies  d crystals of aqp were digested with carboxypeptidase y which cleaves off the intracellular c terminus difference maps of afm topographs between the native and the peptidase treated aqp s showed the carboxylic tail to be close to the  fold symmetry axis of the tetramer sds page and matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation mass spectrometry of native and decarboxylated bovine and human aqp revealed that the ef hand motif found at the c terminus of aqp was partially resistant to peptidase digestion the importance of the c terminal domain is implicated by structural instability of decarboxylated aqp  a possible role of the c terminus and calcium in translocation of aqp in cholangiocytes from intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane and in triggering its fusion is discussed functional studies are now required to identify the physiological role of the ca  binding site
