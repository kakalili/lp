ion conductance of the stem of the anthrax toxin channel during lethal factor translocation
the tripartite anthrax toxin consists of protective antigen lethal factor lf  and edema factor pa  the  kda c terminal part of protective antigen forms heptameric channels in cell membranes that allow for the transport of lf and edema factor into the cytosol these channels are mushroom shaped with a ring of seven phenylalanine residues known as the phenylalanine clamp lining the junction between the cap and the stem it is known that when lf is translocated through the channel the phenylalanine clamp creates a seal that causes an essentially complete block of conduction in order to examine ion conductance in the stem of the channel we used venus yellow fluorescent protein as a molecular stopper to trap lfn the  kda   residue n terminal segment of lf  as well as various truncated constructs of lfn in mutant channels in which the phenylalanine clamp residues were mutated to alanines here we present evidence that ion movement occurs within the channel stem but is stopped of course at the phenylalanine clamp during protein translocation furthermore we also propose that the lower region of the stem plays an important role in securing peptide chains during translocation
