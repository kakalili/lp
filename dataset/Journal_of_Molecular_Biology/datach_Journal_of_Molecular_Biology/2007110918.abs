crystal structure of human pus  a novel pseudouridine synthase
pseudouridine   synthases catalyze the formation of one or more specific  s in structured rnas five families of  synthases have been characterized based on sequence homology pus  has no significant sequence homology to these defined families and therefore represents a new family of  synthases initial characterization studies show that an archael pus  catalyzes the universally conserved   in trna we present here the crystal structure of human pus  at     resolution which is the first structural description from this novel  synthase family pus  is a crescent shaped molecule with two domains the universally conserved  synthase catalytic domain and a thump containing domain which is unique to the pus  family superposition of the catalytic domains of pus  and other  synthases identifies the full set of conserved  synthase active site residues indicating that pus  likely employs a similar catalytic mechanism to other  synthases the pus  active site is located in a deep pocket of a basic cleft adjacent to flexible thumb and forefinger loops which could provide further stabilization for binding the rna substrate modeling studies demonstrate that the cleft between the catalytic and accessory domain is large enough and electrostatically compatible to accommodate an rna stem and support the role of the n terminal domain as an accessory rna binding domain
