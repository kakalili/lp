structures of the class d carbapenemase oxa  from acinetobacter baumannii in complex with doripenem
the emergence of class d  lactamases with carbapenemase activity presents an enormous challenge to health practitioners particularly with regard to the treatment of infections caused by gram negative pathogens such as acinetobacter baumannii unfortunately class d  lactamases with carbapenemase activity are resistant to  lactamase inhibitors to better understand the details of the how these enzymes bind and hydrolyze carbapenems we have determined the structures of two deacylation deficient variants k d and v  d of the class d carbapenemase oxa  with doripenem bound as a covalent acyl enzyme intermediate doripenem adopts essentially the same configuration in both oxa  variant structures but varies significantly when compared to the non carbapenemase class d member oxa  doripenem complex the alcohol of the   hydroxyethyl moiety is directed away from the general base carboxy k  with implications for activation of the deacylating water the tunnel formed by the y  m  bridge in the apo form of oxa  is largely unchanged by the binding of doripenem the presence of this bridge however causes the distal pyrrolidine sulfonamide group to bind in a drastically different conformation compared to doripenem bound to oxa  the resulting difference in the position of the side chain bridge sulfur of doripenem is consistent with the hypothesis that the tautomeric state of the pyrroline ring contributes to the different carbapenem hydrolysis rates of oxa  and oxa   these findings represent a snapshot of a key step in the catalytic mechanism of an important class d enzyme and might be useful for the design of novel inhibitors
