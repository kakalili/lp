the alkali molten globule state of horse ferricytochrome c observation of cold denaturation
here we present the basic structural properties and the thermodynamic description of a previously unknown alkali molten globule state of horse  ferricytochrome c   both sodium and guanidinium cations stabilize the alkali denatured state at ph   presumably by a charge screening mechanism the na stabilized conformation b state clearly meets with the molecular organizational definition of the generic molten globule state the b state exhibits highly cooperative thermal unfolding transitions monitored by both near and far uv cd analyses of these transitions show substantial heat capacity change suggesting that the hydrophobic effect contributes considerably to its energetic stability at low salt concentration where molten globules are less stable the b state undergoes reversible cold denaturation
