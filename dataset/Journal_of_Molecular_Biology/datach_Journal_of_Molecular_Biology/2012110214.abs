prion protein mprp f  a       structure and stability in solution
the three dimensional structures of prion proteins prps in the cellular form prpc include a stacking interaction between the aromatic rings of the residues y  and f   where f  is conserved in all but two so far analyzed mammalian prp sequences and where y  is strictly conserved to investigate the structural role of f   we characterized the variant mouse prion protein mprp f  a       the nmr solution structure represents a typical prpc fold and it contains a   helical      loop conformation which is well defined because all amide group signals in this loop are observed at   c with this  rigid  loop prpc  behavior mprp f  a       differs from the previously studied mprp y  a       which contains a type i  turn      loop structure when compared to other rigid  loop variants of mprp       mprp f  a       is unique in that the thermal unfolding temperature is lowered by  c these observations enable further refined dissection of the effects of different single residue exchanges on the prpc conformation and their implications for the prpc physiological function
