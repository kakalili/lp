hydrogen bonds,anion-binding,serine proteases,P loop,EF hand,the terms γR, γL,αR and αLrefer to conformational areas delimited by main-chain dihedral angles of individual residues,A number of definitions are in use;we use that given by Efimov.8,Typical φ ψ values are αR, −70°, −40°,αL,γR,γL,RL, LR, RLR and LRL nests, etc. are defined as combinations of consecutive residues with certain main-chain dihedral angles,To qualify as R, −20°&gt;φ&gt;−140° and 40°&gt;ψ&gt;−90°,to qualify as L, 20°&lt;φ&lt;140° and −40°&lt;ψ&lt;90°,The previously described hydrogen bonded motifs discussed here in relation to nests are illustrated in Figure 3.,Asx-motifs and ST-motifs,15, 16 β-bulge loops,3, 30, 36 α-turns28, 29 and paperclips20 have all been described.,Asx-nests (D-nests, N-nests) and ST-nests (S-nests, T-nests) are new motifs described here for the first time.,The NNN angle is that between the main-chain nitrogen atoms of three successive i,i+1 and i+2 residues of a nest
Main-chain conformations where one amino acid residue can be described as γR (or αR) and an adjacent one as γL (or αL) mostly result in the three main-chain NH groups (of the two residues and the one following) forming a depression that can accommodate an atom with a whole or partial negative charge. We propose the name nest for this feature. The negatively charged atom, when present, is also stabilized by hydrogen-bonding with the NH groups. In an average protein, 8 % of residues are involved in a nest. The anion, or partially negatively charged atom, that often occupies the nest may be a main-chain carbonyl oxygen atom as in the paperclip, also called the Schellman loop, and the oxyanion hole of serine proteases. It can be a phosphate group, as in the P-loop superfamily that binds ATP and GTP. Overlapping, compound, nests are observed often, as in the P-loop, which has five successive NH groups that bind the β phosphate group of nucleotide triphosphate. The longest compound nests are found surrounding cysteine-bound [2Fe2S] and [4Fe4S] iron-sulfur centers, which are also anionic; nests may encourage binding of the more reduced forms. The nest is a novel feature in the sense of not having been described as a unique motif with anion-binding potential before, although some of the situations where it occurs are familiar.
