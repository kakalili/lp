zz made ez influence of inhibitor configuration on enzyme selectivity
selectivity of drug targeting is necessary in order to forestall undesired side effects here we examine the structural grounds for the configuration dependent selectivity of   bis  amidinobenzylidene cycloheptan  one   for factor xa and trypsin previous studies showed that factor xa is preferentially inhibited by the z z configuration isomer of   whilst trypsin binds equally well to both e z and z z forms using engineered trypsin variants we find similar overall binding modes for the e z and z z isomers minor changes in van der waals contacts to tyr  leu in trypsin explain the differential inhibition of factor xa we note differences in the experimental electron densities observed from co crystallisation and soaking experiments while the co crystallisation of   with variants containing tyr  leu  reveal the exclusive presence of the z z  e z  configurations respectively soaking experiments with either variant result in mixtures of e z  z z and e e  this discrepancy arises presumably from differences in the spatial packing considerations or chemical crystallisation conditions microenvironments the results presented here represent an extreme example of the problems that face structure based drug design in particular the dangers inherent in relying on a single crystal structure for interpreting protein  ligand interactions
