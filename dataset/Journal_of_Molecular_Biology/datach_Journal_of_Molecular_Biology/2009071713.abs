effect of pseudorepeat rearrangement on  synuclein misfolding vesicle binding and micelle binding
the pathological and physiological hallmarks of the protein  synuclein as are its misfolding into cytotoxic aggregates and its binding to synaptic vesicles respectively both events are mediated by seven  residue amphiphilic pseudorepeats and most generally involve a transition from intrinsically unstructured conformations to structured conformations based on as interactions with aggregation inhibiting small molecules an as variant termed shuffled  synuclein sas  wherein the first six pseudorepeats had been rearranged was introduced here the effects of this rearrangement on misfolding vesicle binding and micelle binding are examined in reference to as and  synuclein to study the sequence characteristics underlying these processes fibrillization correlates with the distinct clustering of residues with high  sheet propensities while vesicle affinities depend on the mode of pseudorepeat interchange and loss in the presence of micelles the pseudorepeat region of sas adopts an essentially continuous helix whereas as and  synuclein encounter a distinct helix break indicating that a more homogeneous distribution of surfactant affinities in sas prevented the formation of an extensive helix break in the micelle bound state by demonstrating the importance of the distribution of  sheet propensities and by revealing inhomogeneous as surfactant affinities the present study provides novel insights into two central themes of synuclein biology
