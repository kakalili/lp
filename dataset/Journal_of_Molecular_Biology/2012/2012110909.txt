We analyze a model for motor-level adaptation in Escherichia coli based upon the premise that clockwise (CW) and counter-clockwise (CCW) states have different preferred numbers of FliM subunits. We show that this model provides a simple mechanism for the recently observed motor-level adaptation, and it also explains the long-lasting puzzle on the thresholds observed when tethered cells are used to monitor responses to temporal ramps. We note that the motor-level adaptation has the same negative-feedback network design as the upstream receptor-level adaptation, and the tandem architecture of one control circuit followed by the other mitigates the effects of cell-to-cell variation and broadens the range of stimuli over which cells optimally respond.
