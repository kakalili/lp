a conserved central region of yeast ada regulates the histone acetyltransferase activity of gcn and interacts with phospholipids
the saga spt  ada  gcn acetyltransferase complex of saccharomyces cerevisiae contains more than  components that acetylate and deubiquitylate nucleosomal histones its acetyltransferase gcn  preferentially acetylates histones h and h b and is regulated through interactions with ada and ngg ada  sequence alignments of ada homologs indicate a conserved    amino acid residue central region to examine the function of this region we constructed ada alleles with mutations of clustered conserved residues one of these alleles ada rlr r  s l  a and r  a  resulted in an approximately threefold reduction in transcriptional activation of the pho gene and growth changes that parallel deletion of ada  microarray analyses further revealed that ada rlr alters expression of a subset of those genes affected by deletion of ada  indicative of ada rlr affecting gcn function ada rlr resulted in a decrease in gcn mediated histone acetylation in vitro to a level approximately   that with wild type ada  in addition in vivo acetylation of k  of histone h b was almost totally eliminated at ada regulated promoters in the ada rlr strain while acetylation of k and k  of histone h was reduced to approximately   of wild type levels we also show that the central region of ada interacts with phospholipids since phosphatidylserine binding paralleled ada function we suggest that lipid binding may play a role in the function or regulation of the saga complex
