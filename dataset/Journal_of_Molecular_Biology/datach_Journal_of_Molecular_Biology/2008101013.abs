thermal probing of e coli rna polymerase off pathway mechanisms
rna polymerase rnap is an essential enzyme for cellular gene expression in an effort to further understand the enzyme s importance in the cell s response to temperature we have probed the kinetic mechanism of escherichia coli rnap by studying the force  velocity behavior of individual rnap complexes at temperatures between  and    c using optical tweezers within this temperature range and at saturating nucleotide concentrations the pause free transcription velocity of rnap was independent of force and increased monotonically with temperature with an elongation activation energy of      kcal mol interestingly the pause density at cold temperatures  to    c was five times higher than that measured above room temperature a simple kinetic model revealed a value of       kcal mol for the activation energy of pause entry suggesting that pause entry is indeed a thermally accessible process the dwell time distribution of all observable pauses was independent of temperature directly confirming a prediction of the model recently proposed for pol ii in which pauses are diffusive backtracks along the dna additionally we find that the force at which the polymerase arrests the arrest force presents a maximum at    c an unexpected result as this is not the optimum temperature for bacterial growth this observation suggests that arrest could play a regulatory role in vivo possibly through interactions with specific elongation factors
