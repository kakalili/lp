the structural basis of substrate recognition in an exo  d glucosaminidase involved in chitosan hydrolysis
family  of the glycoside hydrolase classification is one of the largest families structurally characterized members of this family include enzymes with  galactosidase activity escherichia coli lacz   glucuronidase activity homo sapiens gusb  and  mannosidase activity bacteroides thetaiotaomicron btman a  here we describe the structure of a family  glycoside hydrolase csxa from amycolatopsis orientalis that has exo  d glucosaminidase exo chitosanase activity analysis of a product complex      resolution reveals a unique negatively charged pocket that specifically accommodates the nitrogen of nonreducing end glucosamine residues allowing this enzyme to discriminate between glucose and glucosamine this also provides structural evidence for the role of e  as the catalytic nucleophile and d  as the catalytic acid base the structures of an e  a mutant in complex with a natural    d glucosamine tetrasaccharide substrate and both e  a and d  a mutants in complex with a pnp  d glucosaminide synthetic substrate provide insight into interactions in the  subsite of this enzyme overall a comparison with the active sites of other gh enzymes highlights the unique architecture of the csxa active site which imparts specificity for its cationic substrate
