a highly conserved region essential for nmd in the upf n terminal domain
upf  upf  and upf are the principal regulators of nonsense mediated mrna decay nmd  a cytoplasmic surveillance pathway that accelerates the degradation of mrnas undergoing premature translation termination these three proteins interact with each other the ribosome the translation termination machinery and multiple mrna decay factors but the precise mechanism allowing the selective detection and degradation of nonsense containing transcripts remains elusive here we have determined the crystal structure of the n terminal mif g domain from saccharomyces cerevisiae upf and identified a highly conserved region in this domain that is essential for nmd and independent of upf s binding sites for upf and upf  mutations within this conserved region not only inactivate nmd but also disrupt upf binding to specific proteins including dbp  a dead box helicase although current models indicate that upf functions principally as an activator of upf and a bridge between upf and upf  our data suggest that it may also serve as a platform for the association of additional factors that play roles in premature translation termination and nmd
