an ion channel modulator from the saliva of the brown ear tick has a highly modified kunitz bpti structure
ra klp a  amino acid protein secreted by the salivary gland of the brown ear tick rhipicephalus appendiculatus has a sequence resembling those of kunitz bpti proteins we report the detection purification and characterization of the function of ra klp in addition determination of the three dimensional crystal structure of ra klp at    resolution using sulphur single wavelength anomalous dispersion reveals that much of the loop structure of classical kunitz domains including the protruding protease binding loop has been replaced by  strands even more unusually the n terminal portion of the polypeptide chain is pinned to the  kunitz head  by two disulphide bridges not found in classical kunitz bpti proteins the disulphide bond pattern has been further altered by the loss of the bridge that normally stabilizes the protease binding loop consistent with the conversion of this loop into a  strand ra klp shows no significant anti protease activity however it activates maxik channels in an in vitro system suggesting a potential mechanism for regulating host blood supply during feeding
