the acetylatable lysines of human fen are important for endo and exonuclease activities
human fen can be acetylated in vivo and in vitro resulting in reduced endonuclease and exonuclease activities in vitro acetylation occurs at four lysines located at the c terminus of fen  which is important for dna binding in this paper we show that fen mutant proteins lacking the lysines at the c terminus have both reduced pcna independent exonucleolytic and endonucleolytic activities however lysines at the c terminus are not required for pcna stimulation of human fen  a double flap substrate was optimal for human fen endonuclease and did not require the c terminal lysines similarly a one nucleotide   overhang nick substrate was optimal for human fen exonuclease and also did not require the c terminal lysines finally we found by an electromobility shift assay that human fen had a different mode of binding with a double flap substrate containing a one nucleotide   tail when compared to various other flap substrates taken together our results confirm the double flap substrate as the likely in vivo intermediate for human fen and that the c terminal lysines are important for the endonuclease and exonuclease activities likely through dna binding
