modulation of eukaryotic mrna stability via the cap binding translation complex eif f
decapping by dcp in saccharomyces cerevisiae is a key step in mrna degradation however the cap also binds the eukaryotic initiation factor eif complex f and its associated proteins characterisation of the relationship between decapping and interactions involving eif f is an essential step towards understanding polysome disassembly and mrna decay three types of observation suggest how changes in the functional status of eif f modulate mrna stability in vivo first partial disruption of the interaction between eif e and eif g caused by mutations in eif e or the presence of the yeast e binding protein p  stabilised mrnas the interactions of eif g and p  with eif e may therefore act to modulate the decapping process since we also show that the in vitro decapping rate is not directly affected by the nature of the body of the mrna this suggests that changes in eif f structure could play a role in triggering decapping during mrna decay second these effects were seen in the absence of extreme changes in global translation rates in the cell and are therefore relevant to normal mrna turnover third a truncated form of eif e     had a reduced capacity to inhibit dcp mediated decapping in vitro yet did not change cellular mrna half lives thus the accessibility of the cap to dcp in vivo is not simply controlled by competition with eif e but is subject to switching between molecular states with different levels of access
