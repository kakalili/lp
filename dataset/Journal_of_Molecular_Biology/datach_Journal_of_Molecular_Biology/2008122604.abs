dsrna binding properties of rde  and trbp reflect their distinct roles in rnai
double stranded rna dsrna binding proteins facilitate dicer functions in rna interference caenorhabditis elegans rde  facilitates cleavage of long dsrna to small interfering rna sirna  while human trans activation response rna binding protein trbp functions downstream to pass sirna to the rna induced silencing complex we show that these distinct in vivo roles are reflected in in vitro binding properties rde  preferentially binds long dsrna while trbp binds sirna with an affinity that is independent of dsrna length these properties are mechanistically based on the fact that rde  binds cooperatively via contributions from multiple domains while trbp binds noncooperatively our studies offer a paradigm for how dsrna binding proteins which are not sequence specific discern dsrna length additionally analyses of the ability of rde  deletion constructs and rde  trbp chimeras to reconstitute dicer activity suggest rde  promotes activity using its dsrna binding motif  to bind dsrna its linker region to interact with dicer and its c terminus for dicer activation
