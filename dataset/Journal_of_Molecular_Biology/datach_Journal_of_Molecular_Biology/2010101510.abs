solution structure of the heterotrimeric complex between the interaction domains of rfx and rfxap from the rfx gene regulatory complex
the mammalian immune response is mediated by a heterotetrameric transcriptional control complex called regulatory factor x rfx  that regulates the expression of major histocompatibility complex class ii genes rfx comprises three proteins rfx  two copies  rfxap and rfxb and mutations and deletions that prevent the assembly of the rfx complex have been linked to a severe immunodeficiency disorder two rfx molecules and one rfxap molecule assemble in the cytoplasm prior to nuclear localization a process mediated by an n terminal  dimerization domain  of rfx  rfx n and a c terminal domain of rfxap rfxapc  we previously presented evidence that rfxapc is unstructured in the absence of rfx n but adopts a regular structure in the rfx n  rfxapc complex and that the rfx n  rfxapc complex binds rfxb with high affinity we now report the structure of the rfx n  rfxapc complex determined in solution by  n and  c edited nmr spectroscopy rfx n consists of a long central helix flanked by two shorter helices the central helices of the two rfx n molecules form an antiparallel coiled coil and the flanking helices pack at the ends of the long helices in a perpendicular arrangement such that the rfx n dimer is shaped like a staple rfxapc consists of two  helices that form a v shaped structure that packs within the rfx n staple leucine residues in the leucine rich region of rfx n   lylylql   that are critical for major histocompatibility complex class ii gene expression in vivo contribute to both the dimer leu  and leu  and the rfx n  rfxapc interfaces leu  and leu   the clustering of hydrophobic residues from different regions of rfxapc suggests a potential binding site for rfxb
