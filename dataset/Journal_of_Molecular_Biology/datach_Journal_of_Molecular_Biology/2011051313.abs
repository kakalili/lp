crystal structures of the s cerevisiae spt core and c terminal tandem sh domain
the conserved and essential eukaryotic protein spt functions in transcription elongation chromatin maintenance and rna processing spt has three characterized functions it is a histone chaperone capable of reassembling nucleosomes a central component of transcription elongation complexes and is required for recruitment of rna processing factors to elongating rna polymerase ii rnapii  here we report multiple crystal structures of the   kda spt protein from saccharomyces cerevisiae that together represent essentially all of the ordered sequence our two structures of the    residue core region reveal a series of putative nucleic acid and protein  protein interaction domains that fold into an elongated form that resembles the bacterial protein tex the similarity to a bacterial transcription factor suggests that the core domain performs nucleosome independent activities and as with tex we find that spt binds dna unlike tex however the spt s domain does not contribute to this activity crystal structures of the spt c terminal region reveal a tandem sh domain structure composed of two closely associated sh folds one of these sh folds is cryptic while the other shares striking structural similarity with metazoan sh domains and possesses structural features associated with the ability to bind phosphorylated substrates including phosphotyrosine binding studies with phosphopeptides that mimic the rnapii c terminal domain revealed affinities typical of other rnapii c terminal domain binding proteins but did not indicate a specific interaction overall these findings provide a structural foundation for understanding how spt encodes several distinct functions within a single polypeptide chain
