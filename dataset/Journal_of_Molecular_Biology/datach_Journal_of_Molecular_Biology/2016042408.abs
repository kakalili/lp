tirf microscopy analysis of human cof  cof  and adf effects on actin filament severing and turnover
dynamic remodeling and turnover of cellular actin networks requires actin filament severing by actin depolymerizing factor adf cofilin proteins mammals express three different adf cofilins cof  cof  and adf  and genetic studies suggest that in vivo they perform both overlapping and unique functions to gain mechanistic insights into their different roles we directly compared their g actin and f actin binding affinities and quantified the actin filament severing activities of human cof  cof  and adf using in vitro total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy all three adf cofilins had similar affinities for g actin and f actin however cof and adf severed filaments much more efficiently than cof at both lower and higher concentrations and using either muscle or platelet actin furthermore cof and adf were more effective than cof in promoting  enhanced disassembly  when combined with actin disassembly co factors coronin b and actin interacting protein  aip  and these differences were observed on both preformed and actively growing filaments to probe the mechanism underlying these differences we used multi wavelength total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to directly observe cy  cof and cy  cof interacting with actin filaments in real time during severing cof and cof each bound to filaments with similar kinetics yet cof induced severing much more rapidly than cof  decreasing the time interval between initial binding on a filament and severing at the same location these differences in adf cofilin activities and mechanisms may be used in cells to tune filament turnover rates which can vary widely for different actin structures
