s proteasomes are imported as precursor complexes into the nucleus of yeast edited by r huber
the mechanism by which yeast  s proteasomes are imported into the nucleus is still unresolved here we provide the first evidence that  s proteasomes are imported as precursor complexes into the nucleus by using the srp   mutant which is deficient in nuclear import of cargos with classical nuclear localization sequences cnls  we show that proteasome precursor complexes associate with importin karyopherin    the cnls receptor and that they accumulate inside the cytoplasm reconstitution assays revealed that only precursor complexes are targeted to the nuclear envelope ne by karyopherin    in support the green fluorescent protein gfp labelled maturation factor ump  marking precursor complexes mainly localizes to the nucleus and around the ne our data suggest that nuclear  s proteasomes are finally matured inside the nucleus
