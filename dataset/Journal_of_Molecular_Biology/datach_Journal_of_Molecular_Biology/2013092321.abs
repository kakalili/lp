a  monomers transiently sample oligomer and fibril like configurations ensemble characterization using a combined md nmr approach
amyloid   a  peptides are a primary component of fibrils and oligomers implicated in the etiology of alzheimer s disease ad  however the intrinsic flexibility of these peptides has frustrated efforts to investigate the secondary and tertiary structure of a  monomers whose conformational landscapes directly contribute to the kinetics and thermodynamics of a  aggregation in this work de novo replica exchange molecular dynamics remd simulations on the microseconds per replica timescale are used to characterize the structural ensembles of a   a   and m  oxidized a   three physiologically relevant isoforms with substantially different aggregation properties j coupling data calculated from the remd trajectories were compared to corresponding nmr derived values acquired through two different pulse sequences revealing that all simulations converge on the order of hundreds of nanoseconds per replica toward ensembles that yield good agreement with experiment though all three a  species adopt highly heterogeneous ensembles these are considerably more structured compared to simulations on shorter timescales prominent in the c terminus are antiparallel  hairpins between l   a  a   l  and v   i  similar to oligomer and fibril intrapeptide models that expose these hydrophobic side chains to solvent and may serve as hotspots for self association compared to reduced a   the absence of a second  hairpin in a   and the sampling of alternate  topologies by m  oxidized a   may explain the reduced aggregation rates of these forms a persistent v   k  bend motif observed in all three species is stabilized by buried backbone to side chain hydrogen bonds with d  and a cross region salt bridge between e  and k  highlighting the role of the familial ad linked e  and d  residues in a  monomer folding these characterizations help illustrate the conformational landscapes of a  monomers at atomic resolution and provide insight into the early stages of a  aggregation pathways
