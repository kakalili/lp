the    crystal structure of ca  bound calmodulin an analysis of disorder and implications for functionally relevant plasticity edited by i wilson
calmodulin cam is a highly conserved  kda eukaryotic protein that can bind specifically to over   protein targets in response to a ca  signal ca  cam requires a considerable degree of structural plasticity to accomplish this physiological role however the nature and extent of this plasticity remain poorly characterized here we present the    crystal structure of paramecium tetraurelia ca  cam including  discretely disordered residues and a fifth ca  that mediates a crystal contact the  discretely disordered residues are located primarily in the central helix and the two hydrophobic binding pockets and reveal correlated side chain disorder that may assist target specific deformation of the binding pockets evidence of domain displacements and discrete backbone disorder is provided by translation libration screw tls analysis and multiconformer models of protein disorder respectively in total the evidence for disorder at every accessible length scale in ca  cam suggests that the protein occupies a large number of hierarchically arranged conformational substates in the crystalline environment and may sample a quasi continuous spectrum of conformations in solution therefore we propose that the functionally distinct forms of cam are less structurally distinct than previously believed and that the different activities of cam in response to ca  may result primarily from ca  mediated alterations in the dynamics of the protein
