degenerate rna packaging signals in the genome of satellite tobacco necrosis virus implications for the assembly of a t  capsid
using a recombinant t  satellite tobacco necrosis virus stnv like particle expressed in escherichia coli we have established conditions for in vitro disassembly and reassembly of the viral capsid in vivo assembly is dependent on the presence of the coat protein cp n terminal region and in vitro assembly requires rna using immobilised cp monomers under reassembly conditions with  free  cp subunits we have prepared a range of partially assembled cp species for rna aptamer selection selex directed against the rna binding face of the stnv cp resulted in the isolation of several clones one of which b  matches the stnv  genome in  out of  nucleotide positions including across a statistically significant    stretch this  base region folds into a stem  loop displaying the motif acaa and has been shown to bind to stnv cp analysis of the other aptamer sequences reveals that the majority can be folded into stem  loops displaying versions of this motif using a sequence and secondary structure search motif to analyse the genomic sequence of stnv  we identified  stem  loops displaying the sequence motif axxa the implication is that there are many stem  loops in the genome carrying essential recognition features for binding stnv cp secondary structure predictions of the genomic rna using mfold showed that only  out of  of these stem  loops would be formed in the lowest energy structure these results are consistent with an assembly mechanism based on kinetically driven folding of the rna
