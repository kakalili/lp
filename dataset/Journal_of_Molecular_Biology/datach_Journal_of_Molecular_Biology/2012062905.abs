the dual organization of p bodies revealed by immunoelectron microscopy and electron tomography
processing bodies p bodies are cytoplasmic non membranous domains involved in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression since their discovery several studies using fluorescence based strategies have uncovered their pivotal role in mrna metabolism particularly during translation repression and or mrna degradation yet p bodies still remain a  black box  in which numerous proteins accumulate next to rnas to regulate their fate by unknown mechanisms in this study we investigated the ultrastructural organization of p bodies in human cells using a wide range of original electron microscopy strategies including high pressure freezing and freeze substitution we found that p bodies are huge ribonucleoprotein complexes located in the close proximity of mitochondria and ribosomes in which regulatory factors exhibit differential localization depending on their activity on mrnas we describe the first experiment pairing immunogold labeling with electron tomography immunoelectron tomography of a human p body overall the results depict a p body organization that comprises at least two distinct compartments a dense core on which peripheral protrusions are anchored
