An important question in protein folding is whether molten globule states formed under equilibrium conditions are good structural models for kinetic folding intermediates. The structures of the kinetic and equilibrium intermediates in the folding of the plant globin apoleghemoglobin have been compared at high resolution by quench-flow pH-pulse labeling and interrupted hydrogen/deuterium exchange analyzed in dimethyl sulfoxide. Unlike its well studied homolog apomyoglobin, where the equilibrium and kinetic intermediates are quite similar, there are striking structural differences between the intermediates formed by apoleghemoglobin. In the kinetic intermediate, formed during the burst phase of the quench-flow experiment, protected amides and helical structure are found mainly in the regions corresponding to the G and H helices of the folded protein, and in parts of the E helix and CE loop regions, whereas in the equilibrium intermediate, amide protection and helical structure are seen in parts of the A and B helix regions, as well as in the G and H regions, and the E helix remains largely unfolded. These results suggest that the structure of the molten globule intermediate of apoleghemoglobin is more plastic than that of apomyoglobin, so that it is readily transformed depending on the solution conditions, particularly pH. Thus, in the case of apoleghemoglobin at least, the equilibrium molten globule formed under destabilizing conditions at acid pH is not a good model for the compact intermediate formed during kinetic refolding experiments. Our high-precision kinetic analysis also reveals an additional slow phase during the folding of apoleghemoglobin, which is not observed for apomyoglobin. Hydrogen exchange pulse-labeling experiments show that the slow-folding phase is associated with residues in the CE loop, which probably forms non-native structure in the intermediate that must be resolved before folding can proceed to completion.
