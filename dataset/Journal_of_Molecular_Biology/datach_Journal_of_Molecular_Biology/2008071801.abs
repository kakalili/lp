functional role of the  ionic lock   an interhelical hydrogen bond network in family a heptahelical receptors
activation of family a g protein coupled receptors involves a rearrangement of a conserved interhelical cytoplasmic hydrogen bond network between the e d ry motif on transmembrane helix  h  and residues on h  which is commonly termed the cytoplasmic  ionic lock   glu    of the e d ry motif also forms an intrahelical salt bridge with neighboring arg    in the dark state crystal structure of rhodopsin we examined the roles of glu    and arg    on h and glu    and glu    on h on the activation of rhodopsin using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of wild type and mutant pigments reconstituted into lipid membranes activation of rhodopsin is ph dependent with proton uptake during the transition from the inactive meta i to the active meta ii state glu    of the ery motif is identified as the proton accepting group using the fourier transform infrared protonation signature and the absence of a ph dependence of activation in the e  q mutant neutralization of arg    similarly leads to ph independent receptor activation but with structural alterations in the meta ii state neutralization of glu    and glu    on h  which are involved in interhelical interactions with h and h  respectively led to a shift toward meta ii in the e  q and e  q mutants while retaining the ph sensitivity of the equilibrium disruption of the interhelical interaction of glu    and glu    on h with h and h plays its role during receptor activation but neutralization of the intrahelical salt bridge between glu    and arg    is considerably more critical for shifting the photoproduct equilibrium to the active conformation these conclusions are discussed in the context of recent structural data of the   adrenergic receptor
