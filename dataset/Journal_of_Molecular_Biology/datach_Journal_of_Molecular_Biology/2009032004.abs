crystal structure of cbd from the drosophila na ca  exchanger diversity of ca  regulation and its alternative splicing modification
na ca  exchangers ncxs promote the extrusion of intracellular ca  to terminate numerous ca  mediated signaling processes ca  interaction at two ca  binding domains cbds cbd and cbd  is important for tight regulation of the exchange activity diverse ca  regulatory properties have been reported with several ncx isoforms whether the regulatory diversity of ncxs is related to structural differences of the pair of cbds is presently unknown here we reported the crystal structure of cbd from the drosophila melanogaster exchanger calx   we show that the calx  cbd is an immunoglobulin like structure similar to mammalian ncx cbd  but the predicted ca  interaction region of calx  cbd is arranged in a manner that precludes ca  binding the carboxylate residues that coordinate two ca  in the ncx cbd structure are neutralized by two lys residues in calx  cbd  this structural observation was further confirmed by isothermal titration calorimetry the calx  cbd structure also clearly shows the alternative splicing region forming two adjacent helices perpendicular to cbd  our results provide structural evidence that the diversity of ca  regulatory properties of ncx proteins can be achieved by   local structure rearrangement of ca  binding site to change ca  binding properties of cbd and   alternative splicing variation altering the protein domain  domain conformation to modulate the ca  regulatory behavior
