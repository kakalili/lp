alteration of the c terminal ligand specificity of the erbin pdz domain by allosteric mutational effects
modulation of protein binding specificity is important for basic biology and for applied science here we explore how binding specificity is conveyed in pdz postsynaptic density protein  discs large zonula occludens  domains small interaction modules that recognize various proteins by binding to an extended c terminus our goal was to engineer variants of the erbin pdz domain with altered specificity for the most c terminal position position  where a val is strongly preferred by the wild type domain we constructed a library of pdz domains by randomizing residues in direct contact with position  and in a loop that is close to but does not contact position  we used phage display to select for pdz variants that bind to  peptide ligands differing only at position  to verify that each obtained pdz domain exhibited the correct binding specificity we selected peptide ligands for each domain despite intensive efforts we were only able to evolve erbin pdz domain variants with selectivity for the aliphatic c terminal side chains val ile and leu interestingly many pdz domains with these three distinct specificities contained identical amino acids at positions that directly contact position  but differed in the loop that does not contact position  computational modeling of the selected pdz domains shows how slight conformational changes in the loop region propagate to the binding site and result in different binding specificities our results demonstrate that second sphere residues could be crucial in determining protein binding specificity
