bag is a modular scaffolding protein that physically links heat shock protein   hsp  to the small heat shock proteins
small heat shock proteins shsps are a family of atp independent molecular chaperones that are important for binding and stabilizing unfolded proteins in this task the shsps have been proposed to coordinate with atp dependent chaperones including heat shock protein   hsp   however it is not yet clear how these two important components of the chaperone network are linked we report that the hsp  co chaperone bag  is a modular scaffolding factor to bring together shsps and hsp s using domain deletions and point mutations we found that bag uses both of its ipv motifs to interact with shsps including hsp  hspb   b crystallin hspb  hsp  hspb  and hsp  hspb  bag does not appear to be a passive scaffolding factor rather its binding promoted de oligomerization of hsp  likely by competing for the self interactions that normally stabilize large oligomers bag bound to hsp  at the same time as hsp  hsp  or  b crystallin suggesting that it might physically bring the chaperone families together into a complex indeed addition of bag coordinated the ability of hsp  and hsp  to refold denatured luciferase in vitro together these results suggest that bag physically and functionally links hsp  and shsps
