agonist induced conformational changes in bovine rhodopsin insight into activation of g protein coupled receptors
activation of g protein coupled receptors gpcrs is initiated by conformational changes in the transmembrane tm helices and the intra and extracellular loops induced by ligand binding understanding the conformational changes in gpcrs leading to activation is imperative in deciphering the role of these receptors in the pathology of diseases since the crystal structures of activated gpcrs are not yet available computational methods and biophysical techniques have been used to predict the structures of gpcr active states we have recently applied the computational method liticon to understand the ligand induced conformational changes in   adrenergic receptor by ligands of varied efficacies here we report a study of the conformational changes associated with the activation of bovine rhodopsin for which the crystal structure of the inactive state is known starting from the inactive dark state we have predicted the tm conformational changes that are induced by the isomerization of  cis retinal to all trans retinal leading to the fully activated state metarhodopsin ii the predicted active state of rhodopsin satisfies all of the  known experimental distance constraints the predicted model also correlates well with the experimentally observed conformational switches in rhodopsin and other class a gpcrs namely the breaking of the ionic lock between r    at the intracellular end of tm  part of the dry motif and e    on tm  and the rotamer toggle switch on w    on tm  we observe that the toggling of the w    rotamer modulates the bend angle of tm around the conserved proline the rotamer toggling is facilitated by the formation of a water wire connecting s     w    and h     as a result the intracellular ends of tms  and  move outward from the protein core causing large conformational changes at the cytoplasmic interface the predicted outward movements of tm and tm are in agreement with the recently published crystal structure of opsin which is proposed to be close to the active state structure in the predicted active state several residues in the intracellular loops such as r  v     t   q   q   s   t  and v     become more water exposed compared to the inactive state these residues may be involved in mediating the conformational signal from the receptor to the g protein from mutagenesis studies some of these residues such as v     t  and v     are already implicated in g protein activation the predicted active state also leads to the formation of new stabilizing interhelical hydrogen bond contacts such as those between w    and h    and e    and c     these hydrogen bond contacts serve as potential conformational switches offering new opportunities for future experimental investigations the calculated retinal binding energy surface shows that binding of an agonist makes the receptor dynamic and flexible and accessible to many conformations while binding of an inverse agonist traps the receptor in the inactive state and makes the other conformations inaccessible
