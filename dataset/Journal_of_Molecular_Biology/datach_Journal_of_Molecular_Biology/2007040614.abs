structural stability of covalently linked groes heptamer advantages in the formation of oligomeric structure
in order to understand how inter subunit association stabilizes oligomeric proteins a single polypeptide chain variant of heptameric co chaperonin groes tandem groes was constructed from escherichia coli heptameric groes by linking consecutively the c terminal of one subunit to the n terminal of the adjacent subunit with a small linker peptide the tandem groes esc  showed properties similar to wild type groes in structural aspects and co chaperonin activity in unfolding and refolding equilibrium experiments using guanidine hydrochloride gdn hcl as a denaturant at a low protein concentration    g ml    esc showed a two state transition with a greater resistance toward gdn hcl denaturation cm    m compared to wild type groes cm   m  esc was found to be about  kcal mol   more stable than the wild type groes heptamer at    g ml   kinetic unfolding and refolding experiments of esc revealed that the increased stability was mainly attributed to a slower unfolding rate also a transient intermediate was detected in the refolding reaction interestingly at the physiological groes concentration  gt  mg ml    the free energy of unfolding for groes heptamer exceeded that for esc  these results showed that at low protein concentrations  lt  mg ml    the covalent linking of subunits contributes to the stability but also complicates the refolding kinetics at physiological concentrations of groes however the oligomeric state is energetically preferred and the advantages of covalent linkage are lost this finding highlights a possible advantage in transitioning from multi domain proteins to oligomeric proteins with small subunits in order to improve structural and kinetic stabilities
