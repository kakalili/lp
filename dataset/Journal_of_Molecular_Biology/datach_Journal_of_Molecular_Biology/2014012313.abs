subunit positioning and stator filament stiffness in regulation and power transmission in the v motor of the manduca sexta v atpase
the vacuolar h atpase v atpase is an atp driven proton pump essential to the function of eukaryotic cells its cytoplasmic v domain is an atpase normally coupled to membrane bound proton pump vo via a rotary mechanism how these asymmetric motors are coupled remains poorly understood low energy status can trigger release of v from the membrane and curtail atp hydrolysis to investigate the molecular basis for these processes we have carried out cryo electron microscopy three dimensional reconstruction of deactivated v from manduca sexta in the resulting model three peripheral stalks that are parts of the mechanical stator of the v atpase are clearly resolved as unsupported filaments in the same conformations as in the holoenzyme they are likely therefore to have inherent stiffness consistent with a role as flexible rods in buffering elastic power transmission between the domains of the v atpase inactivated v adopted a homogeneous resting state with one open active site adjacent to the stator filament normally linked to the h subunit although present at   stoichiometry with v  both recombinant subunit c reconstituted with v and its endogenous subunit h were poorly resolved in three dimensional reconstructions suggesting structural heterogeneity in the region at the base of v that could indicate positional variability if the position of h can vary existing mechanistic models of deactivation in which it binds to and locks the axle of the v atpase rotary motor would need to be re evaluated
