the protein capsid of filamentous bacteriophage ph  from thermus thermophilus edited by d rees
the ph  strain of filamentous bacteriophage inovirus grows in the thermophilic bacterium thermus thermophilus at   c we have characterized the viral dna and determined the amino acid sequence of the major coat protein p  the p protein is synthesized without a leader sequence like that of bacteriophage pf but unlike that of bacteriophage pf  both of which grow in the mesophile pseudomonas aeruginosa x ray diffraction patterns from ordered fibres of the ph  virion are similar to those from bacteriophages pf and pf  indicating that the protein capsid of the ph  virion has the same helix symmetry and subunit shape even though the primary structures of the major coat proteins are quite different and the virions assemble at very different temperatures we have used this information to build a molecular model of the ph  protein capsid based on that of pf  and refined the model by simulated annealing using fibre diffraction data extending to    resolution in the meridional direction and to    resolution in the equatorial direction the common design may reflect a fundamental motif of  helix packing although differences exist in the dna packaging and in the means of insertion of the major coat protein of these filamentous bacteriophages into the membrane of the host bacterial cell these may reflect differences in the assembly mechanisms of the virions
