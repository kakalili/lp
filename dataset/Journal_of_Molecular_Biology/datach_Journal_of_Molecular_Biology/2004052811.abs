x ray crystal structure of a non crystalline cellulose specific carbohydrate binding module cbm
natural cellulose exists as a composite of different forms which have historically been broadly characterized as  crystalline  or  amorphous   the recognition of both of these forms of cellulose by the carbohydrate binding modules cbm of microbial glycoside hydrolases is central to natural and efficient biotechnological conversion of plant cell wall biomass there is increasing evidence that at least some individual binding modules target distinct and different regions of non crystalline  amorphous  cellulose competition experiments show that cbm  modules do not compete with cbm  modules when binding to non crystalline cellulose the structure of the bspcbm  http  afmb cnrs mrs fr cazy  module from the bacillus sp    family gh endoglucanase comprising a   amino acid protein has therefore been determined at    resolution using single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering methods the structure reveals a    jelly roll  topology with high degree of similarity to the structure of cbm  domains sequence and structural conservation strongly suggests that these two families of domains have evolved through gene duplication and subsequent divergence the ligand binding site  topographies  of cbms from families    and  begins to shed light on the differential recognition of non crystalline cellulose by multi modular plant cell wall degrading enzymes
