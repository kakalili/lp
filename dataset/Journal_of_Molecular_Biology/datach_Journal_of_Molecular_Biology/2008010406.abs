three dimensional structure of a putative non cellulosomal cohesin module from a clostridium perfringens family  glycoside hydrolase
the genomes of myonecrotic strains of clostridium perfringens encode a large number of secreted glycoside hydrolases the activities of these enzymes are consistent with degradation of the mucosal layer of the human gastrointestinal tract glycosaminoglycans and other cellular glycans found throughout the body in many cases this is thought to aid in the propagation of the major toxins produced by c perfringens one such example is the family  glycoside hydrolases which contains five c perfringens members cpgh a  e  each displaying a unique modular architecture the smallest and most extensively studied member cpgh c comprises an n terminal catalytic domain with  n acetylglucosaminidase activity a family  carbohydrate binding module a family  x module x  of unknown function and a fibronectin type iii like module here we present the structure of the x  module from cpgh c determined by both nmr spectroscopy and x ray crystallography cpgh c x  adopts a jell roll fold comprising two  sheets formed by nine  strands cpgh c x  displays distant amino acid sequence identity yet close structural similarity to the cohesin modules of cellulolytic anaerobic bacteria cohesin modules are responsible for the assembly of numerous hydrolytic enzymes in a cellulose degrading multi enzyme complex termed the cellulosome through a high affinity interaction with the calcium binding dockerin module a planar surface is located on the face of the cpgh  x  structure that corresponds to the dockerin binding region of cellulolytic cohesin modules and has the approximate dimensions to accommodate a dockerin module the presence of cohesin like x  modules in glycoside hydrolases of c perfringens is an indication that the formation of novel x  dockerin mediated multi enzyme complexes with potential roles in pathogenesis is possible
