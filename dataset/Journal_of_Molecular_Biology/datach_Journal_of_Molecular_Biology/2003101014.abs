the significance of the flexible loop in the azurin az iso  from the obligate methylotroph methylomonas sp strain j
the obligate methylotroph methylomonas sp strain j produces two azurins az iso and az iso  as candidates for electron acceptor from methylamine dehydrogenase madh in the electron transfer process involving the oxidation of methylamine to formaldehyde and ammonia the x ray crystallographic study indicated that az iso gives two types of crystals form i and form ii with polyethylene glycol peg   and ammonium sulfate as the precipitants respectively comparison between the two az iso structures in forms i and ii reveals the remarkable structural changes at the top surface of the molecule around the copper atom az iso possesses gly  instead of val  or ala  which is unique among all other azurins around the copper ligand his  inducing the remarkable structural change in the loop region from gly  to gly  when the structure of az iso is superimposed on that of amicyanin in the ternary complex composed of madh amicyanin and cytochrome c   the loop of az iso deeply overlaps with the light subunit of madh however the az iso molecule is probably able to avoid any steric hindrance with the cognate madh to form the complex for intermolecular electron transfer reaction since the loop containing gly  is flexible we discuss why the electron transfer activity of az iso is fivefold higher than that of az iso
