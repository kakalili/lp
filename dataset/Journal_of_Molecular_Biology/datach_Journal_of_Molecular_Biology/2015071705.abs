conformational changes of the clamp of the protein translocation atpase seca
post translational protein translocation across the bacterial plasma membrane is mediated by the interplay of the seca atpase and the protein conducting secy channel seca consists of several domains including two nucleotide binding domains nbd and nbd  a polypeptide cross linking domain ppxd  a helical scaffold domain hsd  and a helical wing domain hwd  ppxd hsd and nbd form a clamp that positions the polypeptide substrate above the channel so that it can be pushed into the channel by a two helix finger of the hsd how the substrate is accommodated in the clamp during translocation is unclear here we report a crystal structure of thermotoga maritima seca at    resolution structural analysis and free energy calculations indicate that the new structure represents an intermediate state during the transition of the clamp from an open to a closed conformation molecular dynamics simulations show that closure of the clamp occurs in two phases an initial movement of ppxd hsd and hwd as a unit followed by a movement of ppxd alone toward nbd  simulations in the presence of a polypeptide chain show that the substrate associates with the back of the clamp by dynamic hydrogen bonding and that the clamp is laterally closed by a conserved loop of the ppxd mutational disruption of clamp opening or closure abolishes protein translocation these results suggest how conformational changes of seca allow substrate binding and movement during protein translocation
