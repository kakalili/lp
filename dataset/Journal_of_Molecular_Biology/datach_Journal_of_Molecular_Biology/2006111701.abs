sequence identity of the direct repeats dr and dr  contributes to the discrimination between primer translocation and in situ priming during replication of the duck hepatitis b virus
there are two mutually exclusive pathways for plus strand dna synthesis in hepadnavirus reverse transcription the predominant pathway gives rise to relaxed circular dna while the other pathway yields duplex linear dna at the completion of minus strand dna synthesis the final rnase h cleavage generates the plus strand primer at direct repeat  dr  a small fraction of viruses make duplex linear dna after initiating plus strand dna synthesis from this site a process called in situ priming to make relaxed circular dna a template switch is necessary for the rna primer generated at dr to initiate plus strand dna synthesis from the direct repeat  dr  located near the opposite end of the minus strand dna a process called primer translocation we are interested in understanding the mechanism that discriminates between these two processes previously we showed that a small dna hairpin forms at dr in the avihepadnaviruses and acts as an inhibitor of in situ priming here using genetic approaches we show that sequence identity between dr and dr is necessary but not sufficient for primer translocation in the duck hepatitis b virus the discrimination between in situ priming and primer translocation depends upon suppression of in situ priming a process that is dependent upon both sequence identity between dr and dr  and the presence of the hairpin at dr  finally our analysis indicates the entire rna primer can contribute to primer translocation and is translocated to dr before initiation of plus strand dna synthesis from that site
