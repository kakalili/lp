pathways for double strand break repair in genetically unstable z dna forming sequences
dna can adopt many structures that differ from the canonical b form and several of these non canonical dna structures have been implicated in genetic instability associated with human disease earlier we found that z dna causes dna double strand breaks dsbs in mammalian cells that can result in large scale deletions and rearrangements in contrast the same z dna forming cg repeat in escherichia coli resulted in only small contractions or expansions within the repeat this difference in the z dna induced mutation spectrum between mammals and bacteria might be due to different mechanisms for dsb repair in mammalian cells non homologous end joining nhej is a major dsb repair pathway while e coli do not contain this system and typically use homologous recombination hr to process dsbs to test the extent to which the different dsb repair pathways influenced the z dna induced mutagenesis we engineered bacterial e coli strains to express an inducible nhej system to mimic the situation in mammalian cells mycobacterium tuberculosis nhej proteins ku and ligase d ligd were expressed in e coli cells in the presence or absence of hr and the z dna induced mutations were characterized we found that the presence of the nhej mechanism markedly shifted the mutation spectrum from small deletions insertions to large scale deletions from  to    our results demonstrate that nhej plays a role in the generation of z dna induced large scale deletions suggesting that this pathway is associated with dna structure induced destabilization of genomes from prokaryotes to eukaryotes
