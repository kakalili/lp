the structural basis of actin organization by vinculin and metavinculin
vinculin is an essential adhesion protein that links membrane bound integrin and cadherin receptors through their intracellular binding partners to filamentous actin facilitating mechanotransduction here we present an    resolution cryo electron microscopy reconstruction and pseudo atomic model of the vinculin tail vt domain bound to f actin upon actin engagement the n terminal  strap  and helix  are displaced from the vt helical bundle to mediate actin bundling we find that an analogous conformational change also occurs in the h   helix of the tail domain of metavinculin mvt upon actin binding a muscle specific splice isoform that suppresses actin bundling by vt these data support a model in which metavinculin tunes the actin bundling activity of vinculin in a tissue specific manner providing a mechanistic framework for understanding metavinculin mutations associated with hereditary cardiomyopathies
