titin organisation and the d architecture of the vertebrate striated muscle i band
the giant muscle protein titin connectin is known to serve as a cytoskeletal element in muscle sarcomeres it elastically restrains lengthening sarcomeres it aids the integrity and central positioning of the a band in the sarcomere and it may act as a template upon which some sarcomeric components are laid down during myogenesis a puzzle has been how titin molecules arranged systematically within the hexagonal a band lattice of myosin filaments can redistribute through the i band to their anchoring sites in the tetragonal z band lattice recent work by liversage and colleagues has suggested that there are six titin molecules per half myosin filament since there are two actin filaments per half myosin filament in a half sarcomere this means that there are three titin molecules interacting with each z band unit cell containing one actin filament in the same sarcomere and one of opposite polarity from the next sarcomere liversage et al suggested that the three titins might be distributed with two on an actin filament of one polarity and one on the filament of opposite polarity here we build on this suggestion and discuss the transition of titin from the a band to the z band we show that there are good structural and mechanical reasons why titin might be organised as liversage et al  suggested and we discuss the possible relationships between a band arrangements in successive sarcomeres along a myofibril
