polymeric structures and dynamic properties of the bacterial actin alfa
alfa is a recently discovered dna segregation protein from bacillus subtilis that is distantly related to actin and the bacterial actin homologues parm and mreb here we show that alfa mostly forms helical   filaments with a repeat of about     that are arranged in three dimensional bundles other polymorphic structures in the form of two dimensional rafts or paracrystalline nets were also observed here alfa adopted a   helical symmetry with a repeat of about     thin polymers consisting of several intertwining filaments also formed observed helical symmetries of alfa filaments differed from those of other members of the actin family f actin parm or mreb both atp and guanosine   triphosphate are able to promote rapid alfa filament formation with almost equal efficiencies the helical structure is only preserved under physiological salt concentrations and at a ph between   and   the physiological range of the cytoplasm of b subtilis polymerization kinetics are extremely rapid and compatible with a cooperative assembly mechanism requiring only two steps monomer activation followed by elongation making alfa one of the most efficient polymerizing motors within the actin family phosphate release lags behind polymerization and time lapse total internal reflection fluorescence images of alfa bundles are consistent with treadmilling rather than dynamic microtubule like instability high pressure small angle x ray scattering experiments reveal that the stability of alfa filaments is intermediate between the stability of parm and the stability of f actin these results emphasize that actin like polymerizing machineries have diverged to produce a variety of filament geometries with diverse properties that are tailored for specific biological processes
