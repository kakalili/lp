ligand screening by exoproteolysis and mass spectrometry in combination with computer modelling
here we present a new approach for protein ligand screening based on the use of limited exoproteolysis coupled to maldi tof mass spectrometry combined with computational modelling and prediction of binding energies as a test for this combined approach we have screened a combinatorial library containing   peptides organized in  peptide samples based on positional scanning format this library is attached to a poly pro framework and screened against the abl sh domain the results obtained demonstrated the validity of the experimental and theoretical approaches in identifying better ligands and in rationalizing the changes in affinity exoproteolysis coupled to maldi tof mass spectrometry could be used to screen complex libraries in a fast and efficient way
