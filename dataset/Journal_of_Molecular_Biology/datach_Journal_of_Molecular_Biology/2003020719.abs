tak is critical for i b kinase mediated activation of the nf  b pathway
cytokine treatment stimulates the i b kinases ikk  and ikk  which phosphorylate the i b proteins leading to their degradation and activation of nf  b regulated genes a clear definition of the specific roles of ikk  and ikk  in activating the nf  b pathway and the upstream kinases that regulate ikk activity remain to be elucidated here we utilized small interfering rnas sirnas directed against ikk  ikk  and the upstream regulatory kinase tak in order to better define their roles in cytokine induced activation of the nf  b pathway in contrast to previous results with mouse embryo fibroblasts lacking either ikk  or ikk  which indicated that only ikk  is involved in cytokine induced nf  b activation we found that both ikk  and ikk  were important in activating the nf  b pathway furthermore we found that the map k tak  which has been implicated in il  induced activation of the nf  b pathway was also critical for tnf  induced activation of the nf  b pathway tnf  activation of the nf  b pathway is associated with the inducible binding of tak to traf and both ikk  and ikk  this analysis further defines the distinct in vivo roles of ikk  ikk  and tak in cytokine induced activation of the nf  b pathway
