conformational flexibility in immunoglobulin e fc   revealed in multiple crystal forms
the structure of immunoglobulin e ige fc   has been solved in three new crystal forms providing  snapshots of the fc conformation and revealing a diverse range of open  closed motions among subunit chains and dimers a more detailed analysis of the open to closed motion of ige fc   was possible with so many structures and the new structures allow a more thorough examination of the flexibility of ige fc and its implications for receptor binding the existence of a hydrophobic pocket at the elbow region of the fc appears to be conformation dependent and suggests a means of regulating the ige fc conformation and potentially receptor binding with small molecules
