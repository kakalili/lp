crystal structure of lactoperoxidase at     resolution
lactoperoxidase lpo is a member of the mammalian peroxidase superfamily it catalyzes the oxidation of thiocyanate and halides freshly isolated and purified samples of caprine lpo were saturated with ammonium iodide and crystallized using   polyethylene glycol   in a hanging drop vapor diffusion setup the structure has been determined using x ray crystallographic method and refined to rcryst and rfree factors of    and    respectively the structure determination revealed an unexpected phosphorylation of ser  in lpo which is also confirmed by anti phosphoserine antibody binding studies the structure is also notable for observing densities for glycan chains at all the four potential glycosylation sites caprine lpo consists of a single polypeptide chain of   amino acid residues and folds into an oval shaped structure the structure contains  well defined  helices of varying lengths including a helix h a unique to lpo and two short antiparallel  strands the structure confirms that the heme group is covalently linked to the protein through two ester linkages involving carboxylic groups of glu  and asp  and modified methyl groups of pyrrole rings a and c respectively the heme moiety is slightly distorted from planarity but pyrrole ring b is distorted considerably however an iron atom is displaced only by     from the plane of the heme group toward the proximal site the substrate diffusing channel in lpo is cylindrical in shape with a diameter of approximately    two histidine residues and six buried water molecules are connected through a hydrogen bonded chain from the distal heme cavity to the surface of protein molecule and seemingly form the basis of proton relay for catalytic action ten iodide ions have been observed in the structure out of these only one iodide ion is located in the distal heme cavity and is hydrogen bonded to the water molecule w  w is also hydrogen bonded to the heme iron as well as to distal his   the structure contains a calcium ion that is coordinated to seven oxygen atoms and forms a typical pentagonal bipyramidal coordination geometry
