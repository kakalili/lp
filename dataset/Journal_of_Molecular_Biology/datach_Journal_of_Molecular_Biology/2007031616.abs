crystal structure of the n terminal domain of the tyrr transcription factor responsible for gene regulation of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis and transport in escherichia coli k
the x ray structure of the n terminal domain of tyrr has been solved to a resolution of     it reveals a modular protein containing an act domain a connecting helix a pas domain and a c terminal helix two dimers are present in the asymmetric unit with one monomer of each pair exhibiting a large rigid body movement that results in a hinging around residue  of     the structure of the dimer is discussed with reference to other transcription regulator proteins putative binding sites are identified for the aromatic amino acid cofactors
