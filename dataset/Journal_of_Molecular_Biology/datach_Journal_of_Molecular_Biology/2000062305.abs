reconstruction of protein form with x ray solution scattering and a genetic algorithm edited by r huber
we have reconstructed from experimental   nm resolution x ray solution scattering profiles the corresponding shapes and sizes of myoglobin troponin c spermadhesin psp i psp ii chymotrypsinogen a superoxide dismutase ovalbumin tubulin nitrite reductase catalase the structural change of troponin c upon dissociation of the two high affinity ca  and the solution model structure of a tandem pair of fibronectin type iii cytoplasmic domains of integrin    before determination of its crystal structure to this purpose we have designed a new genetic algorithm which gradually explores a discrete search space and evolves convergent models made of several hundred beads down to   nm radius best fitting the scattering profile upon debye calculation without geometrical constraints or penalty for loose beads this is a procedure of effective numerical transformation of the one dimensional scattering profiles into three dimensional model structures the number of beads in models is correlated with the protein molecular mass with one exception  the shape and approximate dimensions of each protein have been retrieved by a set of ten solution models essentially superimposable with the available crystal structures
