structure of the adenylylation domain of e coli glutamine synthetase adenylyl transferase evidence for gene duplication and evolution of a new active site
the x ray structure of the c terminal fragment containing residues      of escherichia coli glutamine synthetase adenylyl transferase atase has been determined atase is part of the cascade that regulates the enzymatic activity of e coli glutamine synthetase a key component of the cell s machinery for the uptake of ammonia it has two enzymatic activities adenylyl removase ar and adenylyl transferase at  which are located in distinct catalytic domains that are separated by a regulatory r domain we previously reported the three dimensional structure of the ar domain residues      the present structure contains both the r and at domains ar and at share   sequence identity and also contain the  polymerase motif that is characteristic of many nucleotidylyl transferase enzymes the structures overlap with an rmsd of     when the superhelical r domain is omitted a model for the complete atase molecule is proposed along with some refinements of domain boundaries a rather more speculative model for the complex of atase with glutamine synthetase and the nitrogen signal transduction protein pii is also presented
