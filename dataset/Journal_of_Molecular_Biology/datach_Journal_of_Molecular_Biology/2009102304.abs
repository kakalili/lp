helix stabilization precedes aqueous and bilayer catalyzed fiber formation in islet amyloid polypeptide
islet amyloid polypeptide iapp is an unstructured polypeptide hormone that is cosecreted with insulin in patients with type  diabetes iapp undergoes a transition from its natively disordered state to a highly ordered all  strand amyloid fiber although predominantly disordered iapp transiently samples  helical structure in solution iapp adopts a fully helical structure when bound to membrane surfaces in a process associated with catalysis of amyloid formation here we use spectroscopic techniques to study the structure of full length monomeric iapp under amyloidogenic conditions we observe that the residues with helical propensity in solution     also form the membrane associated helix additionally reduction of the n terminal disulfide bond cys  cys  decreases the extent of helix formed throughout this region through manipulation of sample conditions to increase or decrease the amount of helix we show that the degree of helix formed affects the rate of amyloid assembly formation of helical structure is directly correlated with enhanced amyloid formation both on the membrane surface and in solution these observations support suggested mechanisms in which parallel helix associations bring together regions of the peptide that could nucleate  strand structure remarkably stabilization of non amyloid structure appears to be a key intermediate in assembly of iapp amyloid
