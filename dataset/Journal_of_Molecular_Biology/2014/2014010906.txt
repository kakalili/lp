In eukaryotes, the poly(A) tail added at the 3′ end of an mRNA precursor is essential for the regulation of mRNA stability and the initiation of translation. Poly(A) polymerase (PAP) is the enzyme that catalyzes the poly(A) addition reaction. Multiple isoforms of PAP have been identified in vertebrates, which originate from gene duplication, alternative splicing or post-translational modifications. The complexity of PAP isoforms suggests that they might play different roles in the cell. Phylogenetic studies indicate that vertebrate PAPs are grouped into three clades termed α, β and γ, which originated from two gene duplication events. To date, all the available PAP structures are from the PAPα clade. Here, we present the crystal structure of the first representative of the PAPγ clade, human PAPγ bound to cordycepin triphosphate (3′dATP) and Ca2+. The structure revealed that PAPγ closely resembles its PAPα ortholog. An analysis of residue conservation reveals a conserved catalytic binding pocket, whereas residues at the surface of the polymerase are more divergent.
