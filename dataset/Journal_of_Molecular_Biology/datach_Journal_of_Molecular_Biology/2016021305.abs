comparison of the aggregation of homologous   microglobulin variants reveals protein solubility as a key determinant of amyloid formation
the mouse and human   microglobulin protein orthologs are   identical in sequence and share   sequence similarity these proteins are predicted by various algorithms to have similar aggregation and amyloid propensities however whilst human  m h  m forms amyloid like fibrils in denaturing conditions e g ph   in the absence of nacl mouse  m m  m requires the addition of  m nacl to cause fibrillation here the factors which give rise to this difference in amyloid propensity are investigated we utilise structural and mutational analyses fibril growth kinetics and solubility measurements under a range of ph and salt conditions to determine why these two proteins have different amyloid propensities the results show that although other factors influence the fibril growth kinetics a striking difference in the solubility of the proteins is a key determinant of the different amyloidogenicity of h  m and m  m the relationship between protein solubility and lag time of amyloid formation is not captured by current aggregation or amyloid prediction algorithms indicating a need to better understand the role of solubility on the lag time of amyloid formation the results demonstrate the key contribution of protein solubility in determining amyloid propensity and lag time of amyloid formation highlighting how small differences in protein sequence can have dramatic effects on amyloid formation
