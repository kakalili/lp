p   mediated phosphorylation and sumoylation of atf are mutually exclusive
the ubiquitous activating transcription factor atf  binds as a homodimer to the camp response element tpa response element motifs present in the promoters of its target genes atf is homologous to atf and heterodimerizes with jun or fos proteins modulating their dna binding specificities we previously demonstrated that taf  a component of the tfiid general transcription factor mediates atf transcriptional activity through direct interactions between the two proteins by contrast atf  but not atf  is modified in vivo by sumoylation which restricts its subcellular localization thereby inhibiting its transcriptional activity in the present study we dissect the mechanism of this functional switch we characterized the multisite phosphorylation of the atf activation domain and identified one of the involved kinase p   mitogen activated protein kinase in addition we show that epidermal growth factor treatment results in a two step modification mechanism of atf activation domain the thr  residue is phosphorylated first by a presently unknown kinase allowing p   mitogen activated protein kinase to modify the thr  residue excluding the sumoylation of atf protein the resulting activation of transcription is related to an increased association of taf  with this phosphorylated form of atf  our data therefore conclusively establish that sumoylation and phosphorylation of atf are two antagonistic posttranslational modifications
