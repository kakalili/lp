the structures of bacteriophages k e and k  explain processive degradation of polysaccharide capsules and evolution of new host specificities
external polysaccharides of many pathogenic bacteria form capsules protecting the bacteria from the animal immune system and phage infection however some bacteriophages can digest these capsules using glycosidases displayed on the phage particle we have utilized cryo electron microscopy to determine the structures of phages k e and k  and thereby establish the mechanism by which these phages attain and switch their host specificity using a specific glycosidase both phages penetrate the capsule and infect the neuroinvasive human pathogen escherichia coli k  in addition to the k specific glycosidase each k  particle carries a second enzyme that allows it to infect e coli k  whose capsule is chemically different from that of k  the enzymes are organized into a multiprotein complex attached via an adapter protein to the virus portal vertex through which the dna is ejected during infection the structure of the complex suggests a mechanism for the apparent processivity of degradation that occurs as the phage drills through the polysaccharide capsule the enzymes recognize the adapter protein by a conserved n terminal sequence providing a mechanism for phages to acquire different enzymes and thus to evolve new host specificities
