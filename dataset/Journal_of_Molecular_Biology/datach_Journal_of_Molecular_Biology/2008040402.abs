thermodynamic dissection of progesterone receptor interactions at the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter monomer binding and strong cooperativity dominate the assembly reaction
progesterone receptors prs play critical roles in eukaryotic gene regulation yet the mechanisms by which they assemble at their promoters are poorly understood one of the few promoters amenable to analysis is the mouse mammary tumor virus gene regulatory sequence embedded within this sequence are four progesterone response elements pres corresponding to a palindromic pre and three half site pres early mutational studies indicated that the presence of all four sites generated a synergistic and strong transcriptional response however dna binding analyses suggested that receptor assembly at the promoter occurred in the absence of significant cooperativity taken together the results indicated that cooperative interactions among pres could not account for the observed functional synergy more broadly the studies raised the question of whether cooperativity was a common feature of pr mediated gene regulation as a step toward obtaining a quantitative and thus predictive understanding of receptor function we have carried out a thermodynamic dissection of pr a isoform interactions at the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter utilizing analytical ultracentrifugation and quantitative footprinting we have resolved the microscopic energetics of pr a isoform binding including cooperativity terms our results reveal a model contrary to that inferred from previous biochemical investigations specifically the binding unit at a half site is not a receptor dimer but is instead a monomer monomers bound at half sites are capable of significant pairwise cooperative interactions occupancy of all three half sites is required to cooperatively engage the palindromic bound dimer and finally large unfavorable forces accompany assembly overall monomer binding accounts for the majority of the intrinsic binding energetics and cooperativity contributes an approximately   fold increase in receptor  promoter stability finally the partitioning of cooperativity suggests a framework for interpreting in vivo transcriptional synergy these results highlight the insight available from rigorous analysis and demonstrate that receptor  promoter interactions are considerably more complex than typically envisioned
