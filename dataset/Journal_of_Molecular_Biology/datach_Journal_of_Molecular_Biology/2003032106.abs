insight into the functional consequences of inherited variants of the hmyh adenine glycosylase associated with colorectal cancer complementation assays with hmyh variants and pre steady state kinetics of the corresponding mutated e coli enzymes
the oxidized guanine lesion   dihydro  oxo   deoxyguanosine og is highly mutagenic resulting in g c to t a transversion mutations in the absence of repair the escherichia coli adenine glycosylase muty and its human homolog hmyh play an important role in the prevention of mutations associated with og by removing misincorporated adenine residues from og a mismatches previously biallelic mutations of hmyh have been identified in a british family family n with symptoms characteristic of familial adenomatous polyposis fap  which is typically associated with mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli apc gene afflicted members of this family were compound heterozygotes for two mutations in hmyh y  c and g  d these positions are highly conserved in muty across phylogeny the current work reveals a reduced ability of the hmyh variants compared to wild type wt hmyh to complement the activity of e coli muty in muty   e coli in vitro analysis of the corresponding mutations in e coli muty revealed a reduction in the adenine glycosylase activity of the enzymes in addition evaluation of substrate affinity using a substrate analog    deoxy   fluoroadenosine fa revealed that both mutations severely diminish the ability to recognize fa and discriminate between og and g importantly adenine removal with both the mutant and wt e coli enzymes was observed to be less efficient from a mismatch in the sequence context observed to be predominantly mutated in tumors of family n interestingly the magnitude of the reduced activity of the e coli mutant enzymes relative to the wt enzyme was magnified in the  hotspot  sequence context if the corresponding mutations in hmyh cause similar sensitivity to sequence context this effect may contribute to the specific targeting of the apc gene the lack of complementation of the hmyh variants for muty and the reduced activity of the y c and g  d e coli enzymes provide additional circumstantial evidence that the somatic mutations in apc and the occurrence of fap in family n are due to a reduced ability of the y  c and g  d hmyh enzymes to recognize and repair og a mismatches
