the structure specific recognition protein  associates with lens epithelium derived growth factor proteins and modulates hiv  replication
the lens epithelium derived growth factor p  ledgf p  is a chromatin bound protein essential for efficient lentiviral integration genome wide studies have located ledgf p  inside actively transcribed genes where it mediates lentiviral integration although its role in hiv  integration is clearly established the role of ledgf p  associated proteins in hiv  infection remains unexplored using protein  protein interaction assays we demonstrated that ledgf p  complexes with a chromatin remodeling complex facilitates chromatin transcription fact  a heterodimer of the structure specific recognition protein  ssrp  and the human homolog of suppressor of ty   hspt   detailed analysis of the interaction of ledgf p  with the fact complex indicates that ledgf p  interacts with ssrp in an hspt  independent manner that requires the pwwp domain of ledgf proteins and the hmg domain of ssrp  functional characterizations demonstrate a ledgf p  independent role of ssrp in the regulation of hiv  replication shrna mediated partial knockdown of ssrp reduces hiv  infection but not murine leukemia virus in human cd  t cells similarly ssrp knockdown affects infection by hiv  derived viruses that express genes from the viral ltr but not from an internal immediate early cmv promoter suggesting a role of ssrp in ltr driven gene expression but not in viral dna integration together our data demonstrate for the first time the association of ledgf proteins with the fact complex and give further support to a role of ssrp in hiv  infection
