a structural basis for substrate selectivity and stereoselectivity in octopine dehydrogenase from pecten maximus
octopine dehydrogenase n  d  carboxyethyl l arginine nad oxidoreductase  ocdh from the adductor muscle of the great scallop pecten maximus catalyzes the reductive condensation of l arginine and pyruvate to octopine during escape swimming this enzyme which is a prototype of opine dehydrogenases opdhs  oxidizes glycolytically born nadh to nad  thus sustaining anaerobic atp provision during short periods of strenuous muscular activity in contrast to some other opdhs ocdh uses only l arginine as the amino acid substrate here we report the crystal structures of ocdh in complex with nadh and the binary complexes nadh l arginine and nadh pyruvate providing detailed information about the principles of substrate recognition ligand binding and the reaction mechanism ocdh binds its substrates through a combination of electrostatic forces and size selection which guarantees that ocdh catalysis proceeds with substrate selectivity and stereoselectivity giving rise to a second chiral center and exploiting a  molecular ruler  mechanism
