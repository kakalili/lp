PhoB is a transcriptional activator that binds to the phosphate box in the promoters of the phosphate genes of Escherichia coli. PhoB contains two functional domains, an N-terminal phosphorylation domain and a C-terminal DNA-binding/transactivation domain. Here, the three-dimensional structure of the DNA-binding/transactivation domain has been determined by NMR. It consists of an N-terminal four-stranded β-sheet, a central three helical bundle and a C-terminal β-hairpin. The second and third helices form a helix-turn-helix (HTH) variant containing a longer turn than the corresponding turn of the classical HTH motif. The overall architecture is very close to that of the OmpR DNA-binding/transactivation domain, however, the conformation of the long turn region of PhoB, a putative interaction site for the RNA polymerase σ subunit, is entirely different from that of the corresponding turn of OmpR, which interacts with the α subunit. In addition, the third helix of PhoB is three amino acid residues longer than the corresponding helix of OmpR. The binding site of PhoB is a TGTCA sequence and the phospahte box contains the two binding sites. NMR studies of the complexes of the PhoB DNA-binding/transactivation domain bound to several different DNA molecules have revealed that two PhoB molecules bind in a tandem array on the phosphate box. In each complex of PhoB the third helix of the DNA-binding/transactivation domain is likely to recognize the TGTCA sequence from the major groove of DNA and the C-terminal β-hairpin contacts on the minor groove of the 3′ site out of the TGTCA sequence in a non-specific manner. The long turn region facing outward is likely to interact with the σ subunit.
