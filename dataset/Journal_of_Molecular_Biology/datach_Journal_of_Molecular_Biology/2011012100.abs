recognition of mitochondrial targeting sequences by the import receptors tom  and tom
the tom  and tom  receptor subunits of the tom translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane complex recognize n terminal presequences of proteins that are to be imported into the mitochondrion in plants tom  is c terminally anchored in the mitochondrial membrane whereas tom  is n terminally anchored in animals and fungi furthermore the cytosolic domain of tom  in plants is smaller than its animal fungal counterpart and contains fewer acidic residues here nmr spectroscopy was used to explore presequence interactions with the cytosolic regions of receptors from the plant arabidopsis thaliana and the fungus saccharomyces cerevisiae i e  attom  attom  and sctom   it was found that attom  possesses a discontinuous bidentate hydrophobic binding site for presequences the presequences on plant mitochondrial proteins comprise two or more hydrophobic binding regions to match this bidentate site nmr data suggested that while these presequences bind to sctom  they do not bind to attom  attom  however binds to attom  at the same binding site as presequences suggesting that this domain competes with the presequences of imported proteins thereby enabling their progression along the import pathway
