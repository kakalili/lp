remodeling of the human papillomavirus type  replication origin into discrete nucleoprotein particles and looped structures by the e protein
the human papillomavirus hpv dna replication origin ori shares a common theme with many dna control elements in having multiple binding sites for one or more proteins spaced over several hundreds of base pairs the hpv type  ori spans   bp and contains three palindromic e binding sites e bs  e bs  and e bs  for the dimeric e ori binding protein these sites are separated by  and  bp e bs  is located   bp upstream of e bs  and is not required for efficient transient or cell free replication in this study electron microscopy was used to visualize complexes of hpv  dna ori bound by purified e protein dna containing only e bs  showed a single e dimer bound dna containing e bs  and e bs  showed two side by side e dimers while dna containing e bs  e bs  and e bs  exhibited a large disk ring shaped protein particle bound indicating that the dna had been remodeled into a discrete complex likely containing an e hexamer with all four binding sites present up to   of the dna molecules were arranged into loops by e  the majority of which spanned e bs  and one of the other three sites studies on the dependence of looping on salt atp and dtt using full length e and an e protein containing only the carboxyl terminal dna binding and protein dimerization domain suggest that looping is dependent on the n terminal domain and factors that may affect the manner in which e scans dna for binding sites the role of these structures in the modeling and regulation of the hpv  ori is discussed
