protein flexibility in ligand docking and virtual screening to protein kinases
the main complicating factor in structure based drug design is receptor rearrangement upon ligand binding induced fit  it is the induced fit that complicates cross docking of ligands from different ligand  receptor complexes previous studies have shown the necessity to include protein flexibility in ligand docking and virtual screening very few docking methods have been developed to predict the induced fit reliably and at the same time to improve on discriminating between binders and non binders in the virtual screening process we present an algorithm called the icm flexible receptor docking algorithm ifreda to account for protein flexibility in virtual screening by docking flexible ligands to a flexible receptor ifreda generates a discrete set of receptor conformations which are then used to perform flexible ligand  rigid receptor docking and scoring this is followed by a merging and shrinking step where the results of the multiple virtual screenings are condensed to improve the enrichment factor in the ifreda approach both side chain rearrangements and essential backbone movements are taken into consideration thus sampling adequately the conformational space of the receptor even in cases of large loop movements as a preliminary step to show the importance of incorporating protein flexibility in ligand docking and virtual screening and to validate the merging and shrinking procedure we compiled an extensive small scale virtual screening benchmark of  crystal structures of four different protein kinases sub families capk cdk  p  and lck  where we obtained an enrichment factor fold increase of      using two or three multiple experimental conformations ifreda was used in eight protein kinase complexes and was able to find the correct ligand conformation and discriminate the correct conformations from the  misdocked  conformations solely on the basis of energy calculation five of the generated structures were used in the small scale virtual screening stage and by merging and shrinking the results with those of the original structure we show an enrichment factor fold increase of       comparable to that obtained using multiple experimental conformations our cross docking tests on the protein kinase benchmark underscore the necessity of incorporating protein flexibility in both ligand docking and virtual screening the methodology presented here will be extremely useful in cases where few or no experimental structures of complexes are available while some binders are known
