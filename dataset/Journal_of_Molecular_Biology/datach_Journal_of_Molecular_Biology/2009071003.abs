n acetylglucosamine recognition by a family  carbohydrate binding module from clostridium perfringens nagh
many carbohydrate active enzymes have complex architectures comprising multiple modules that may be involved in catalysis carbohydrate binding or protein  protein interactions carbohydrate binding modules cbms are a common ancillary module whose function is to promote the adherence of the complete enzyme to carbohydrate substrates cbm family  has been proposed to be one of the most diverse cbm families classified to date yet all of the structurally characterized cbm s thus far recognize galactose based ligands here we report a unique binding specificity and mode of ligand binding for a family  cbm naghcbm   is one of four cbm  modules in nagh a family  glycoside hydrolase secreted by clostridium perfringens naghcbm   has the  sandwich scaffold common to members of the family however its specificity for n acetylglucosamine is unusual among cbms x ray crystallographic analysis of the module at resolutions from   to     and in complex with disaccharides reveals that its mode of sugar recognition is quite different from that observed for galactose specific cbm s this study continues to unravel the diversity of cbms found in family  and how these cbms might impart the carbohydrate binding specificity to the extracellular glycoside hydrolases in c perfringens
