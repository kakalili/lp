effect of domain order on the activity of bacterially produced bispecific single chain fv antibodies
bispecific single chain fv antibodies comprise four covalently linked immunoglobulin variable vh and vl domains of two different specificities depending on the order of the vh and vl domains and on the length of peptides separating them the single chain molecule either forms two single chain fv scfv modules from the adjacent domains of the same specificity a so called scfv  scfv tandem  scfv   or folds head to tail with the formation of a diabody like structure a so called bispecific single chain diabody scbsdb  we generated a number of four domain constructs composed of the same vh and vl domains specific either for human cd  or cd  but arranged in different orders when expressed in bacteria all scfv  variants appeared to be only half functional binding to cd  and demonstrating no cd binding activity only the diabody like scbsdb could bind both antigens comparison of the scbsdb with a structurally similar non covalent dimer diabody demonstrated a stabilizing effect of the linker in the middle of the scbsdb molecule we demonstrated that the mechanism of inactivation of cd  cd diabody under physiological conditions is initiated by a dissociation of the weaker anti cd  vh vl interface followed by domain swapping with the formation of non active homodimers the instability of one homodimer makes the process of diabody dissociation reassociation irreversible thus gradually decreasing the fraction of active molecules the structural parameters influencing the formation of functional bispecific single chain antibodies are indicated and ways of making relatively stable bispecific molecules are proposed
