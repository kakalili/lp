denatured state thermodynamics residual structure chain stiffness and scaling factors edited by c r matthews
a set of nine variants of yeast iso  cytochrome c with zero or one surface histidine have been engineered such that the n terminal amino group is acetylated in vivo n terminal acetylation has been confirmed by mass spectral analysis of intact and proteolytically digested protein the histidine heme loop forming equilibrium under denaturing conditions  m guanidine hydrochloride  has been measured by ph titration providing an observed pka pka obs  for each variant n terminal acetylation prevents the n terminal amino group heme binding equilibrium from interfering with measurements of histidine heme affinity significant deviation is observed from the linear dependence of pka obs on the log of the number of monomers in the loop formed expected for a random coil denatured state the maximum histidine heme affinity occurs for a loop size of  monomers for loop sizes of     monomers histidine heme pka obs values are consistent with a scaling factor of        this value is much larger than the scaling factor of    for a freely jointed random coil which is commonly used to represent the conformational properties of protein denatured states for loop sizes of nine to  monomers chain stiffness is likely responsible for the decreases in histidine heme affinity relative to a loop size of   the results are discussed in terms of residual structure and sequence composition effects on the conformational properties of the denatured states of proteins
