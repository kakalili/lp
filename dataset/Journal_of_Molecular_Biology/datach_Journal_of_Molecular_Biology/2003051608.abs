exploration of the transition state for tertiary structure formation between an rna helix and a large structured rna
docking of the p duplex into the pre folded core of the tetrahymena group i ribozyme exemplifies the formation of tertiary interactions in the context of a complex structured rna we have applied  analysis to p docking which compares the effects of modifications on the rate constant for docking kdock with the effects on the docking equilibrium kdock  to accomplish this we used a single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay that allows direct determination of the rate constants for formation of thermodynamically favorable as well as unfavorable states modification of the eight groups of the p duplex that make tertiary interactions with the core and changes in solution conditions decrease kdock up to   fold whereas kdock changes by   fold the absence of effects on kdock both from atomic modifications and global perturbations strongly suggests that the transition state for docking is early and does not closely resemble the docked state these results the slow rate of docking of s   and the observation that a modification that is expected to increase the degrees of freedom between the p duplex and the ribozyme core accelerates docking suggest a model in which a kinetic trap s slows docking substantially nonetheless urea does not increase kdock suggesting that there is little change in the exposed surface area between the trapped undocked state and the transition state the findings highlight that urea and temperature dependencies can be inadequate to diagnose the presence of kinetic traps in a folding process the results described here combined with previous work provide an in depth view of an rna tertiary structure formation event and suggest that large highly structured rnas may have local regions that are misordered
