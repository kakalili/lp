conformations of nhaa the na h exchanger from escherichia coli in the ph activated and ion translocating states
nhaa the main sodium  proton exchanger in the inner membrane of escherichia coli regulates the cytosolic concentrations of h and na it is inactive at acidic ph becomes active between ph  and ph   and reaches maximum activity at ph   by cryo electron microscopy of two dimensional crystals grown at ph  and incubated at higher ph we identified two sequential conformational changes in the protein in response to ph or substrate ions the first change is induced by a rise in ph from  to  and marks the transition from the inactive state to the ph activated state ph activation which precedes the ion induced conformational change is accompanied by an overall expansion of the nhaa monomer and a local ordering of the n terminus the second conformational change is induced by the substrate ions na and li at ph above  and involves a   displacement of helix ivp this movement would cause a charge imbalance at the ion binding site that may trigger the release of the substrate ion and open a periplasmic exit channel
