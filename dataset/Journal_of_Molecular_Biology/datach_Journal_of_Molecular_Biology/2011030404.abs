structurally constrained residues outside the binding motif are essential in the interaction of    and phosphorylated partner
proteins participate in many key cellular processes after binding to disordered phospho partners usually the phosphorylated state is an essential target for the binding here we show for the first time residues other than those in the    binding motif that are essential for the binding between    and a phosphorylated partner results support that phosphorylation although necessary is not sufficient for     s complex formation as structurally constrained anchor residues play a critical function in stabilizing the protein  protein interaction
