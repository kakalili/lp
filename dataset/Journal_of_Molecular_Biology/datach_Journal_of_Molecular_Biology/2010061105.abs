structure of the mitochondrial editosome like complex associated tutase  reveals divergent mechanisms of utp selection and domain organization
rna uridylylation reactions catalyzed by terminal uridylyl transferases tutases play critical roles in the formation of the mitochondrial transcriptome in trypanosomes two mitochondrial rna editing tutases have been described rna editing tutase  catalyzes guide rna ribosomal rna and mrna   uridylylation and rna editing tutase  acts as a subunit of the rna editing core complex also referred to as the  s editosome to perform guided u insertion mrna editing although rna editing tutase  and rna editing tutase  carry out distinct functions and possess dissimilar enzymatic properties their catalytic n terminal domain and base recognition c terminal domain display a high degree of similarity while their middle domains are less conserved meat  mitochondrial editosome like complex associated tutase   which interacts with an editosome like assembly and is exclusively u specific nonetheless shows limited similarity with editing tutases and lacks the middle domain the crystal structures of apo meat and utp bound meat refined to     and      respectively reveal an unusual mechanism of utp selection and domain organization previously unseen in tutases in addition to established invariant utp binding determinants we have identified and verified critical contributions of meat specific residues using mutagenesis furthermore meat possesses a novel bridging domain which extends from the c terminal domain and makes hydrophobic contacts with the n terminal domain thereby creating a cavity adjacent to the utp binding site unlike the minimal tut tutase meat shows no appreciable conformational change upon utp binding and apparently does not require rna substrate to select a cognate nucleoside triphosphate because meat is essential for the viability of the bloodstream and insect forms of trypanosoma brucei the unique organization of its active site renders this protein an attractive target for trypanocide development
