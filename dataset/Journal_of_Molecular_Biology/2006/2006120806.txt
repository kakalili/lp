The dimerization domain of Escherichia coli ATP synthase b subunit forms an atypical parallel two-stranded coiled coil. Sequence analysis reveals an 11-residue abcdefghijk repeat characteristic of right-handed coiled coils, but no other naturally occurring parallel dimeric structure of this class has been identified. The arrangement of the helices was studied by their propensity to form interhelix disulfide linkages and analysis of the stability and shape of disulfide-linked dimers. Disulfides formed preferentially between cysteine residues in an a position of one helix and either of the adjacent h positions of the partner. Such heterodimers were far more stable to thermal denaturation than homodimers and, on the basis of gel-filtration chromatography studies, were similar in shape to both non-covalent dimers and dimers linked through flexible Gly(1â€“3)Cys C-terminal extensions. The results indicate a right-handed coiled-coil structure with intrinsic asymmetry, the two helices being offset rather than in register. A function for the right-handed coiled coil in rotational catalysis is proposed.
