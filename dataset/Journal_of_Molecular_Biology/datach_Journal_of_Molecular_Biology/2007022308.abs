expression of gata  in a non hematopoietic cell line induces  globin locus control region chromatin structure remodeling and an erythroid pattern of gene expression
gata  is a hematopoietic transcription factor expressed in erythroid megakaryocytic mast cell and eosinophil lineages it is required for normal erythroid differentiation the expression of erythroid specific genes and for the establishment of an active chromatin structure throughout the  globin gene locus gata  is also necessary for the formation and function of the locus control region dnase i hypersensitive site hs core elements to determine whether gata  was sufficient to direct formation of the locus control region lcr and an erythroid pattern of gene expression we expressed gata  in the non hematopoietic hela cell line that does not express other hematopoietic transcription factors but does express gata  gata  and gata  we found that production of the gata  protein resulted in the formation of lcr dnase i hss    in their normal locations and that histones became hyperacetylated within these regulatory elements transcription of several erythroid specific genes was activated in hela cells expressing gata  including those coding for  globin   globin the erythropoietin receptor the erythroid kr pple like factor and p  nf e  despite increased expression of these genes at the mrna level their protein products were not detected these results imply that gata  is sufficient to direct chromatin structure reorganization within the  globin lcr and an erythroid pattern of gene expression in the absence of other hematopoietic transcription factors
