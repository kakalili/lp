the influence of the buried glutamine or glutamate residue in position  on the structure of immunoglobulin variable domains
immunoglobulin vh domain frameworks can be grouped into four distinct types depending on the main chain conformation of framework  based on the analysis of over   x ray structures representing more than   non redundant vh domain sequences we have come to the conclusion that the marked structural variability of the vh framework  region is caused by three residues the buried side chain of h  which can be either a glutamate or a glutamine residue the residue in position h  which may be proline only if h is glutamine and by h  h  according to a new consensus nomenclature  which has to be either glycine or proline if h is a glutamate residue in natural antibodies these three residues are encoded in combinations that are compatible with each other and with the rest of the structure and therefore will yield functional molecules however the degenerate primer mixtures commonly used for pcr cloning of antibody fragments can and frequently do introduce out of context mutations to combinations that can lead to severe reduction of stability production yield and antigen affinity
