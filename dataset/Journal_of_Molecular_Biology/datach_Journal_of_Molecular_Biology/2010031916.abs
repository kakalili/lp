the c terminal lysine of ogg dna glycosylases is a major molecular determinant for guanine  oxoguanine distinction
dihydro  oxoguanine  oxog is a major oxidative lesion found in dna the  oxoguanine dna glycosylases ogg responsible for the removal of  oxog are divided into three families ogg  ogg and agog the ogg members are devoid of the recognition loop used by ogg to discriminate between  oxog and guanine and it was unclear until recently how ogg enzymes recognize the oxidized base we present here the first crystallographic structure of an ogg member methanocaldococcus janischii ogg in complex with a dna duplex containing the  oxog lesion this structure highlights the crucial role of the c terminal lysine strictly conserved in ogg  in the recognition of  oxog the structure also reveals that ogg undergoes a conformational change upon dna binding similar to that observed in ogg glycosylases furthermore this work provides a structural rationale for the lack of opposite base specificity in this family of enzymes
