atp synthase from saccharomyces cerevisiae location of the oscp subunit in the peripheral stalk region
a biotinylation signal has been fused to the c terminus of the oligomycin sensitivity conferral protein oscp of the atp synthase complex from saccharomyces cerevisiae the signal is biotinylated in vivo and the biotinylated complex binds avidin in vitro by electron microscopy of negatively stained particles of the atp synthase  avidin complex the bound avidin has been localised close to the f domain the images were subjected to multi reference alignment and classification because of the presence of a flexible linker between the oscp and the biotinylation signal the class averages differ in the position of the avidin relative to the f domain these positions lie on an arc and its centre indicates the position of the c terminus of the oscp on the surface of the f domain since the n terminal region of the oscp is known to interact with the n terminal regions of  subunits which are on top of the f domain distal from the fo membrane domain the oscp extends almost  nm along the surface of f down towards fo where it interacts with the c terminus of the b subunit which extends up from fo the labelling technique has also allowed a reliable d projection map to be developed for the intact atp synthase from s cerevisiae the map reveals a marked asymmetry in the fo part of the complex that can be attributed to subunits in the fo domain
