sequence context strongly modulates association of polar residues in transmembrane helices
polar residues are capable of mediating the association of membrane embedded helices through the formation of side chain side chain inter helical hydrogen bonds however the extent to which native van der waals packing of the residues surrounding the polar locus can enhance or interfere with the interaction of polar residues has not yet been studied we examined the propensities of four polar residues aspartic acid asparagine glutamic acid and glutamine to promote self association of transmembrane tm domains in several biologically derived sequence environments including i four naturally occurring tm domains that contain a glu or gln residue tnf cd  ligand c a ig   c b ig   and fut   fucosyltransferase  and ii variants of bacteriophage m  major coat protein tm segment with asp and asn at interfacial and non interfacial positions self association was quantified by the toxcat assay which measures tm helix self oligomerization in the escherichia coli inner membrane while an appropriately placed polar residue was found in several cases to significantly stabilize tm helix  helix interactions through the formation of an interhelical hydrogen bond in other cases the strongly polar residues did not enhance the association of the two helices overall these results suggest that an innate structural mechanism may operate to control non specific association of membrane embedded polar residues
