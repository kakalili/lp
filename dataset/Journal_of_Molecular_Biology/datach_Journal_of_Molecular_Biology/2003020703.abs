a multifunctional turnip crinkle virus replication enhancer revealed by in vivo functional selex
the motif hairpin m h  located on    strands of turnip crinkle virus tcv associated satellite rna c satc  is a replication enhancer and recombination hotspot results of in vivo genetic selection selex systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment  where  bases of the m h were randomized and then subjected to selection in plants revealed that most winners contained one to three short motifs many of which in their    sense orientation are found in tcv and satc    strand promoter elements ability to replicate in protoplasts correlated with fitness to accumulate in plants with one significant exception winner uc containing only a seven base replacement sequence was the second most fit winner yet replicated no better than a  base random replacement sequence fitness of satc containing different m h replacement sequences could be due to enhanced satc replication or enhanced ability to affect tcv movement since satc interferes with tcv virion accumulation which is correlated with enhanced movement to younger tissue cells inoculated with tcv and uc accumulated fewer virions when compared to other winners that replicated better in protoplasts but were less fit in plants uc and other first and second round winners contained structures that were on average   more stable in their   strand orientation and most formed hairpins with a a rich sequence at the base these results suggest that m h replacement sequences contribute to the fitness of satc by either containing    strand elements that enhance satrna replication and or a   strand hairpin flanked with single stranded sequence that enhances tcv movement
