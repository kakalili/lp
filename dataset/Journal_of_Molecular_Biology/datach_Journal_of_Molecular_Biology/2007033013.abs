lobe ib of the atpase domain of kar p bip interacts with ire p to negatively regulate the unfolded protein response in saccharomyces cerevisiae
the endoplasmic reticulum hsp  chaperone bip kar p is both the sensor for the unfolded protein response upr in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and a target of transcriptional up regulation by this signaling pathway in this study the molecular form of kar p that interacts with the ire p transmembrane receptor kinase to inhibit upr signaling was shown to be the substrate free atp bound conformation oligosaccharide shielding experiments localized the binding site for ire p to the top of the back face of lobe ib of the kar p atpase domain the interaction between kar p and ire p is abolished by substitution of glutamic acid for glutamine   a residue on the surface of lobe ib that is likely to be shielded by ectopic oligosaccharide side chains that also prevented the interaction between the two proteins glutamine  is conserved significantly throughout the hsp  chaperone family and others have shown that the nmr resonances of the corresponding glutamine residue in thermus thermophilus dnak display chemical shift perturbations between the atp bound and adp bound states and in the presence of a substrate peptide we conclude that glutamine  is part of or close to the ire p binding site displayed on the atp bound conformation of kar p binding of an unfolded polypeptide to the substrate binding domain of kar p could alter the positioning of glutamine  and other residues on lobe ib involved in binding ire p releasing ire p for activation of upr signaling
