the rela nuclear localization signal folds upon binding to i b
the nuclear localization signal nls polypeptide of rela the canonical nuclear factor  b family member is responsible for regulating the nuclear localization of rela containing nuclear factor  b dimers the rela nls polypeptide also plays a crucial role in mediating the high affinity and specificity of the interaction of rela containing dimers with the inhibitor i b  forming two helical motifs according to the published x ray crystal structure in order to define the nature of the interaction between the rela nls and i b  under solution conditions we conducted nmr and isothermal titration calorimetry studies using a truncated form of i b  containing residues     and a peptide spanning residues      of rela the nls peptide although largely unfolded has a weak tendency toward helical structure when free in solution upon addition of the labeled peptide to unlabeled i b  the resonance dispersion in the nmr spectrum is significantly greater providing definitive evidence that the rela nls polypeptide folds upon binding i b  isothermal titration calorimetry studies of single point mutants reveal that residue f   which is located in the middle of the more c terminal of the two helices helix  in the i b  bound rela nls polypeptide is critical for the binding of the rela nls polypeptide to i b  these results help to explain the role of helix  in mediating the high affinity of rela for i b
