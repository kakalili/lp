nmr structural studies on human p  a rhogapff revealed that domain phosphorylation by the pdgf receptor  requires its previous unfolding
p  a and b rho gaps guanosine triphosphatase activating proteins are the only cytoplasmatic proteins containing ff domains in p  a rho gap the region containing the ff domains has been implicated in binding to the transcription factor tfii i moreover phosphorylation of tyr  within the first ff domain inhibits this interaction because the structural determinants governing this mechanism remain unknown we sought to solve the structure of the first ff domain of p  a rho gap rhogapff  and to study the potential impact of phosphorylation on the structure we found that rhogapff does not fold with the typical             arrangement of other ff domains instead the nmr data obtained at   k show an            topology in addition we observed that specific contacts between residues in the first loop and the fourth helix are indispensable for the correct folding and stability of this domain the structure also revealed that tyr  contributes to the domain hydrophobic core furthermore the residues that compose the target motif of the platelet derived growth factor receptor  kinase form part of the   helix we observed that the phosphorylation reaction requires a previous step including domain unfolding a process that occurs at   k in the absence of phosphorylation the temperature dependent rhogapff folding unfolding process is reversible however phosphorylation causes an irreversible destabilization of the rhogapff structure which probably accounts for the inhibitory effect that it exerts on the tfii i interaction our results link the ability of a protein domain to be phosphorylated with conformational changes in its three dimensional structure
