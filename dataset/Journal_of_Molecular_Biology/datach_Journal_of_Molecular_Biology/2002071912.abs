interference between the pha  and peb  transcription factors in formation of the caenorhabditis elegans pharynx
pha  is a forkhead winged helix transcription factor that acts as an organ identity factor in the development of the caenorhabditis elegans pharynx peb  is a novel dna binding protein also involved in pharyngeal morphogenesis pha  and peb  bind at overlapping sites on the c  sequence element that controls pharynx specific expression of the c elegans myo  gene it has been suggested that pha  and peb  act cooperatively on the c  sequence in this study we test this model and assess the c  dependent transcriptional activity of pha  and peb  both individually and in combination we show that pha  and peb  are both modest transcriptional activators in yeast but that co expression of the two factors does not result in significantly increased expression of a c  regulated reporter gene electrophoretic mobility shift assays provide no evidence for the formation of a pha  peb  complex in vitro but rather show that pha  and peb  cannot bind c  simultaneously as we have reported previously ectopic expression of pha  in c elegans causes ectopic expression of a c  regulated reporter gene we show that ectopic expression of peb  cannot cause ectopic expression of the same reporter but rather ectopic peb  inhibits reporter gene activation by pha  overall our results do not support a model in which pha  and peb  synergize in vivo but rather support a model in which peb  may negatively modulate pha  s ability to activate transcription through c  during formation of the c elegans pharynx
