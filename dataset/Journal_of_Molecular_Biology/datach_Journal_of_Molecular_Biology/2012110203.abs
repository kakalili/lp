optimizing membrane protein overexpression in the escherichia coli strain lemo  de
escherichia coli bl  de  is widely used to overexpress proteins in this overexpression host the gene encoding the target protein is located on a plasmid and is under control of the t promoter which is recognized exclusively by the t rna polymerase rnap  the t rnap gene is localized on the chromosome and its expression is governed by the non titratable iptg inducible lacuv promoter recently we constructed the lemo  de  strain which allows improved control over the expression of genes from the t promoter lemo  de  is a bl  de  strain equipped with a plasmid harboring the gene encoding t lysozyme an inhibitor of the t rnap under control of the exceptionally well titratable rhamnose promoter the overexpression yields of a large collection of membrane proteins in lemo  de  at different concentrations of rhamnose indicated that this strain may be very suitable for optimizing the production of membrane proteins however insight in the mechanism by which optimized expression yields are achieved in lemo  de  is lacking furthermore whether the overexpressed proteins are suitable for functional and structural studies remains to be tested here we show that in lemo  de   i the modulation of the activity of the t rnap by the t lysozyme is key to optimizing the ratio of membrane proteins properly inserted in the cytoplasmic membrane to non inserted proteins  ii maximizing the yields of membrane proteins is accompanied by reduction of the adverse effects of membrane protein overexpression resulting in stable overexpression and iii produced membrane proteins can be used for functional and structural studies
