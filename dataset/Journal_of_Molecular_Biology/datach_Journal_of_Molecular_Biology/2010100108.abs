influence of the cytoplasmic domains of aquaporin  on water conduction and array formation
phosphorylation of ser  in cytoplasmic loop d has been shown to reduce the water permeability of aquaporin aqp   the predominant water channel in the brain however when the structure of the s  d mutant aqp m s  d  which was generated to mimic phosphorylated ser   was determined to     resolution using electron diffraction patterns it showed no significant differences from the structure of the wild type channel high resolution density maps usually do not resolve protein regions that are only partially ordered but these can sometimes be seen in lower resolution density maps calculated from electron micrographs we therefore used images of two dimensional crystals and determined the structure of aqp m s  d at    resolution the features of the    density map are consistent with those of the previously determined atomic model in particular there were no indications of any obstruction near the cytoplasmic pore entrance in addition water conductance measurements both in vitro and in vivo show the same water permeability for wild type and mutant aqp m  suggesting that the s  d mutation neither reduces water conduction through a conformational change nor reduces water conduction by interacting with a protein that would obstruct the cytoplasmic channel entrance finally the    map shows a cytoplasmic density in between four adjacent tetramers that most likely represents the association of four n termini this finding supports the critical role of the n terminus of aqp in the stabilization of orthogonal arrays as well as their interference through lipid modification of cysteine residues in the longer n terminal isoform
