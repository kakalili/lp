modelling zinc binding proteins with gadget genetic algorithm and distance geometry for exploring topology
a novel combination of optimization methods genetic algorithm with distance geometry has been developed and shown to find near optimal solutions to a set of imposed structural constraints with this modelling tool gadget  the fold space of a variety of small zinc binding proteins was investigated under the constraints required to form a zinc binding site or pair of sites  analysis of the results concentrated on the ring finger domain as the  classic  zinc finger domains were too constrained to provide much topological variety whilst the tfiih domain which has large unstructured loops did not behave well the intermediate ring finger domain however was found to adopt a variety of different folds many of which had near optimal scores under the fitness function employed in gadget forming good secondary structures and zinc coordination  although the native fold was dominant amongst the solutions the discovery of good alternate folds shows that even the eight residues constrained to form two zinc binding sites was not sufficient to uniquely determine the native fold despite this the fold space of  theoretically possible folds was greatly reduced with just six topologies found in significant numbers
