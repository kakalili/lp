crystal structure of chaperonin  from paracoccus denitrificans
the crystal structure of chaperonin  from paracoccus denitrificans p cpn  has been determined at    resolution by the molecular replacement method two heptameric rings of identical subunits of p cpn  in adjacent asymmetric units are stacked in a back to back manner and form a cylinder as found in groel cpn  from escherichia coli with respect to the unliganded groel structure each subunit of p cpn  tilts   outwards and the apical domain twists   counter clockwise in the top view in a hinge like manner rendering the central hole   wider despite the subunit tilts both rings in p cpn  contact at two sites of the equatorial domain in the same way as in groel interactions between residues   and   and   and   observed in groel were not found in p cpn  and the interaction between   and   was weaker in p cpn  than in groel the unique hydrogen bond between   and   was observed at the right site in p cpn  which could account for why the subunits tilt outwards the contact surface area was reduced at the left site which is similar to the observed changes in the groel structures induced by atp binding in general inter ring interactions in p cpn  were weakened which is consistent with findings that p cpn  is observed in single ring forms as well as in double ring forms
