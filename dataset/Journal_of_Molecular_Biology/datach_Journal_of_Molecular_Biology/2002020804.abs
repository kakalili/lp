characterization of two highly similar rad  homologs of physcomitrella patens edited by m yaniv
the moss physcomitrella patens which is a land plant with efficient homologous recombination encodes two rad  proteins pparad   and pparad    the pparad   and pparad   proteins which share   identity between them interact with themselves and with each other both proteins bind ssdna and dsdna in a mg  and ph dependent manner with a stoichiometry of  one pparad   monomer per    nt or bp and one pparad   monomer per     nt or bp respectively at neutral ph a   fold excess of both proteins is required for ssdna and dsdna binding pparad   and pparad   show ssdna dependent atpase activity and efficiently promote strand annealing in a nucleotide independent but in a mg  dependent manner both proteins promote joint molecule formation dna strand invasion and are able to catalyse strand exchange in the presence of mg  and atp no further increase in the activities is observed when both proteins are present in the same reaction none of the pparad  gene products complement the dna repair and recombination phenotype of saccharomyces cerevisiae rad   mutants however pparad   confers a dominant negative dna repair phenotype and both pparad  proteins reduce the levels of double strand break induced recombination when overexpressed in s cerevisiae wt cells these results suggest that both pparad  proteins are bona fide rad  proteins that may contribute in a different manner to homologous recombination and that they might replace scrad  in a hypothetical yeast protein complex inactivating different functions required for recombinational repair
