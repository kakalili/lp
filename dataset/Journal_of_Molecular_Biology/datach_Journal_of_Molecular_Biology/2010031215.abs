glycine rich loop of mitochondrial processing peptidase  subunit is responsible for substrate recognition by a mechanism analogous to mitochondrial receptor tom
tryptophan fluorescence measurements were used to characterize the local dynamics of the highly conserved glycine rich loop grl of the mitochondrial processing peptidase mpp   subunit in the presence of the substrate precursor reporter tryptophan residue was introduced into the grl of the yeast  mpp y  w or at a proximal site y  w  time resolved and steady state fluorescence spectroscopy demonstrated that for trp   the primary contact with the yeast malate dehydrogenase precursor evokes a change of the local grl mobility moreover time resolved measurements showed that a functionless  mpp with a single residue deletion in the loop y  w  g   is defective particularly in the primary contact with substrate thus the grl was proved to be part of a contact site of the enzyme specifically recognizing the substrate regarding the surface exposure and presence of the hydrophobic patches within the grl we proposed a functional analogy between the presequence recognition by the hydrophobic binding groove of the tom  mitochondrial import receptor and the grl of the  mpp a molecular dynamics md simulation of the mpp  substrate peptide complex model was employed to test this hypothesis the initial positioning and conformation of the substrate peptide in the model fitting were chosen based on the analogy of its interaction with the tom  binding groove md simulation confirmed the stability of the proposed interaction and showed also a decrease in grl flexibility in the presence of substrate in agreement with fluorescence measurements moreover conserved substrate hydrophobic residues in positions  and   to the cleavage site remain in close contact with the side chains of the grl during the entire production part of md simulation as stabilizing points of the hydrophobic interaction we conclude that the grl of the mpp  subunit is the crucial evolutional outcome of the presequence recognition by mpp and represents a functional parallel with tom  import receptor
