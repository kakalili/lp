The crystal structure of a post-translationally modified form of eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) with four extra residues on its N terminus ((−4)EDN) has been solved and refined at atomic resolution (1 Å). Two of the extra residues can be placed unambiguously, while the density corresponding to two others is poor. The modified N terminus appears to influence the position of the catalytically important His129, possibly explaining the diminished catalytic activity of this variant. However, (−4)EDN has been shown to be cytotoxic to a Kaposi’s sarcoma tumor cell line and other endothelial cell lines. Analysis of the structure and function suggests that the reason for cytotoxicity is most likely due to cellular recognition by the N-terminal extension, since the intrinsic activity of the enzyme is not sufficient for cytotoxicity and the N-terminal extension does not affect the conformation of EDN.
