redox regulation of plasmodium falciparum ornithine  aminotransferase
ornithine  aminotransferase oat of the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum catalyzes the reversible conversion of ornithine into glutamate  semialdehyde and glutamate and is  in contrast to its human counterpart  activated by thioredoxin trx by a factor of   trx glutaredoxin and plasmoredoxin are redox active proteins that play a crucial role in the maintenance and control of redox reactions and were shown to interact with p falciparum oat oat which is involved in ornithine homeostasis and proline biosynthesis is essential for mitotic cell division in rapidly growing cells thus representing a potential target for chemotherapeutic intervention here we report the three dimensional crystal structure of p falciparum oat at     resolution the overall structure is very similar to that of the human oat however in plasmodial oat the loop involved in substrate binding contains two cysteine residues which are lacking in human oat site directed mutagenesis of these cysteines and functional analysis demonstrated that cys  and cys  mediate the interaction with trx interestingly the cys   ser mutant has a strongly reduced specific activity most likely due to impaired binding of ornithine cys  and cys  are highly conserved in plasmodium but do not exist in other organisms suggesting that redox regulation of oat by trx is specific for malaria parasites plasmodium might require a tight trx mediated control of oat activity for coordinating ornithine homeostasis polyamine synthesis proline synthesis and mitotic cell division
