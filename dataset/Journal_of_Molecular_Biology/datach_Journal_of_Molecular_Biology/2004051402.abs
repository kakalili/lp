thermostability gradient in the collagen triple helix reveals its multi domain structure
a triple helical conformation and stability at physiological temperature are critical for the mechanical and biological functions of the fibril forming collagens here we characterized the role of consecutive domains of collagen ii in stabilizing the triple helix analysis of melting temperatures of genetically engineered collagen like proteins consisting of tandem repeats of the d  d  d or d collagen ii periods revealed the presence of a gradient of thermostability along the collagen molecule with thermolabile n terminal domains and thermostable c terminal domains these results imply a multi domain character of the collagen triple helix assays of thermostabilities of the arg cys and arg  cys collagen ii mutants suggest that in contrast to the thermostable domains the thermolabile domains are able to accommodate amino acid substitutions without altering the thermostability of the entire collagen molecule
