identification of a unique fe s cluster binding site in a glycyl radical type microcompartment shell protein
recently progress has been made toward understanding the functional diversity of bacterial microcompartment mcp systems which serve as protein based metabolic organelles in diverse microbes new types of mcps have been identified including the glycyl radical propanediol grp mcp within these elaborate protein complexes bmc domain shell proteins bacterial microcompartment in reference to the shell protein domain  assemble to form a polyhedral barrier that encapsulates the enzymatic contents of the mcp interestingly the grp mcp contains a number of shell proteins with unusual sequence features grpu is one such shell protein whose amino acid sequence is particularly divergent from other members of the bmc domain superfamily of proteins that effectively defines all mcps expression purification and subsequent characterization of the protein showed unexpectedly that it binds an iron sulfur cluster we determined x ray crystal structures of two grpu orthologs providing the first structural insight into the homohexameric bmc domain shell proteins of the grp system the x ray structures of grpu both obtained in the apo form combined with spectroscopic analyses and computational modeling show that the metal cluster resides in the central pore of the bmc shell protein at a position of broken  fold symmetry the result is a structurally polymorphic iron sulfur cluster binding site that appears to be unique among metalloproteins studied to date
