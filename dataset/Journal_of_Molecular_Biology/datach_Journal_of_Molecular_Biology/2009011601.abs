defining the dna substrate binding sites on hiv  integrase
a tetramer model for human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  integrase in with dna representing long terminal repeat ltr termini was previously assembled to predict the in residues that interact with the ltr termini these predictions were experimentally verified for nine amino acid residues chen a  weber i t  harrison r w  amp leis j     identification of amino acids in hiv  and avian sarcoma virus integrase subsites required for specific recognition of the long terminal repeat ends j biol chem           in a similar strategy the unique amino acids found in avian sarcoma virus in rather than hiv  or mason  pfizer monkey virus in were substituted into the structurally related positions of hiv  in substitutions of six additional residues q  l  e  d   s   and d   showed changes in the   processing specificity of the enzyme verifying their predicted interaction with the ltr dna the newly identified residues extend interactions along a  bp length of the ltr termini and are consistent with known ltr dna hiv  in cross links the tetramer model for hiv  in with ltr termini was modified to include two in binding domains for lens epithelium derived growth factor p  the target dna was predicted to bind in a surface trench perpendicular to the plane of the ltr dna binding sites of hiv  in and extending alongside lens epithelium derived growth factor this hypothesis is supported by the in vitro activity phenotype of hiv  in mutant with a k  s substitution showing loss in strand transfer activity while maintaining   processing on an hiv  substrate mutations at seven other residues reported in the literature have the same phenotype and all eight residues align along the length of the putative target dna binding trench
