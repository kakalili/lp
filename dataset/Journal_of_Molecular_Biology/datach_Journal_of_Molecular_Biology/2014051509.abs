d cryo electron reconstruction of bmra a bacterial multidrug abc transporter in an inward facing conformation and in a lipidic environment
abc atp binding cassette membrane exporters are efflux transporters of a wide diversity of molecule across the membrane at the expense of atp a key issue regarding their catalytic cycle is whether or not their nucleotide binding domains nbds are physically disengaged in the resting state to settle this controversy we obtained structural data on bmra a bacterial multidrug homodimeric abc transporter in a membrane embedded state bmra in the apostate was reconstituted in lipid bilayers forming a mixture of ring shaped structures of  or  homodimers three dimensional models of the ring shaped structures of  or  homodimers were calculated at  nm and  nm resolution from cryo electron microscopy respectively in these structures bmra adopts an inward facing open conformation similar to that found in mouse p glycoprotein structure with the nbds separated by nm both lipidic leaflets delimiting the transmembrane domains of bmra were clearly resolved in planar membrane sheets the nbds were even more separated bmra in an atp bound conformation was determined from two dimensional crystals grown in the presence of atp and vanadate a projection map calculated at  nm resolution shows an open outward facing conformation overall the data are consistent with a mechanism of drug transport involving large conformational changes of bmra and show that a bacterial abc exporter can adopt at least two open inward conformations in lipid membrane
