c ebp  is a major regulatory element driving transcriptional activation of the cxcl  promoter
cxcl  is considered a constitutively expressed chemokine with homeostatic functions however induction of cxcl  expression and its potential role in several pathologic conditions have been reported suggesting that cxcl  gene expression can be induced by different stimuli to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of cxcl  gene expression we aim to define the molecular factors that operate at the transcriptional level basal constitutive expression of cxcl  was dependent on basic helix  loop  helix factors transcriptional up regulation of the cxcl  gene was induced by cellular confluence or inflammatory stimuli such as interleukin  and interleukin  in a ccaat enhancer binding protein   c ebp  dependent manner chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed c ebp  binding to a specific response element located at     of the promoter region of cxcl  our data show that c ebp  is a major regulatory element driving transcription of the cxcl  gene in response to cytokines and cell confluence
