kinetic regulation of single dna molecule denaturation by t gene  protein structural domains
bacteriophage t gene  protein gp  specifically binds single stranded dna a property essential for its role in dna replication recombination and repair although on a thermodynamic basis single stranded dna binding proteins should lower the thermal melting temperature of double stranded dna dsdna  gp  does not using single molecule force spectroscopy we show for the first time that gp  is capable of slowly destabilizing natural dsdna direct measurements of single dna molecule denaturation and renaturation kinetics in the presence of gp  and its proteolytic fragments reveal three types of kinetic behavior attributable to specific protein structural domains which regulate gp  s helix destabilizing capabilities whereas the full length protein exhibits very slow denaturation kinetics a truncate lacking the acidic c domain exhibits much faster kinetics this may reflect a steric blockage of the dna binding site and or a conformational change associated with this domain additional removal of the n domain which is needed for binding cooperativity further increases the dna denaturation rate suggesting that both of these domains are critical to the regulation of gp  s helix destabilization capabilities this regulation is potentially biologically significant because uncontrolled helix destabilization would be lethal to the cell we also obtain equilibrium measurements of the helix coil transition free energy in the presence of these proteins for the first time
