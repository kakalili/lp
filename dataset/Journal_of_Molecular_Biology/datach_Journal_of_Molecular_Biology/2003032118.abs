solution nmr structure of ribosome binding factor a rbfa  a cold shock adaptation protein from escherichia coli
ribosome binding factor a rbfa from escherichia coli is a cold shock adaptation protein it is essential for efficient processing of  s rrna and is suspected to interact with the   terminal helix helix i of  s rrna rbfa is a member of a large family of small proteins found in most bacterial organisms making it an important target for structural proteomics here we describe the three dimensional structure of rbfa   a   residue construct with  residues removed from the carboxyl terminus of full length rbfa determined in solution at ph   by heteronuclear nmr methods the structure determination was carried out using largely automated methods for determining resonance assignments interpreting nuclear overhauser effect noe spectroscopy noesy spectra and structure generation rbfa   has an    fold containing three helices and three  strands              the structure has type ii kh domain fold topology related to conserved kh sequence family proteins whose     subunits are characterized by a helix turn helix motif with sequence signature gxxg at the turn in rbfa this     subunit is characterized by a helix kink helix motif in which the gxxg sequence is replaced by a conserved axg sequence including a strongly conserved ala residue at position  forming an interhelical kink the electrostatic field distribution about rbfa   is bipolar one side of the molecule is strongly negative and the opposite face has a strong positive electrostatic field a  dynamic hot spot  of rbfa   has been identified in the vicinity of a  bulge at strongly conserved residue ser  by  n r  r relaxation rate and heteronuclear  n  h noe measurements analyses of these distributions of electrostatic field and internal dynamics together with evolutionary implications of fold and sequence conservation suggest that rbfa is indeed a nucleic acid binding protein and identify a potential rna binding site in or around the conserved polypeptide segment ser   asp  corresponding to the   loop   helix loop strand structure while the structure of rbfa   is most similar to that of the kh domain of the e coli era gtpase its electrostatic field distribution is most similar to the kh domain of the nusa protein from thermotoga maritima another cold shock associated rna binding protein both rbfa and nusa are regulated in the same e coli operon structural and functional similarities between rbfa nusa and other bacterial type ii kh domains suggest previously unsuspected evolutionary relationships between these cold shock associated proteins
