GATA-1 is a hematopoietic transcription factor expressed in erythroid, megakaryocytic, mast cell and eosinophil lineages. It is required for normal erythroid differentiation, the expression of erythroid-specific genes and for the establishment of an active chromatin structure throughout the β-globin gene locus. GATA-1 is also necessary for the formation and function of the locus control region DNase I hypersensitive site (HS) core elements. To determine whether GATA-1 was sufficient to direct formation of the locus control region (LCR) and an erythroid pattern of gene expression, we expressed GATA-1 in the non-hematopoietic HeLa cell line that does not express other hematopoietic transcription factors but does express GATA-2, GATA-3, and GATA-6. We found that production of the GATA-1 protein resulted in the formation of LCR DNase I HSs 1–4 in their normal locations, and that histones became hyperacetylated within these regulatory elements. Transcription of several erythroid-specific genes was activated in HeLa cells expressing GATA-1, including those coding for α-globin, β-globin, the erythropoietin receptor, the erythroid krüpple-like factor and p45 NF-E2. Despite increased expression of these genes at the mRNA level, their protein products were not detected. These results imply that GATA-1 is sufficient to direct chromatin structure reorganization within the β-globin LCR and an erythroid pattern of gene expression in the absence of other hematopoietic transcription factors.
