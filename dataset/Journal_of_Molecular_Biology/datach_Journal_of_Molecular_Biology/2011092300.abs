aggregation kinetics of interrupted polyglutamine peptides
abnormally expanded polyglutamine domains are associated with at least nine neurodegenerative diseases including huntington s disease expansion of the glutamine region facilitates aggregation of the impacted protein and aggregation has been linked to neurotoxicity studies of synthetic peptides have contributed substantially to our understanding of the mechanism of aggregation because the underlying biophysics of polyglutamine mediated association can be probed independent of their context within a larger protein in this report interrupting residues were inserted into polyglutamine peptides q   and the impact on conformational and aggregation properties was examined a peptide with two alanine residues formed laterally aligned fibrillar aggregates that were similar to the uninterrupted q  peptide insertion of two proline residues resulted in soluble nonfibrillar aggregates which did not mature into insoluble aggregates in contrast insertion of a  turn template dpg rapidly accelerated aggregation and resulted in a fibrillar aggregate morphology with little lateral alignment between fibrils these results are interpreted to indicate that a long range nonspecific interactions lead to the formation of soluble oligomers while maturation of oligomers into fibrils requires conformational conversion and b that soluble oligomers dynamically interact with each other while insoluble aggregates are relatively inert kinetic analysis revealed that the increase in aggregation caused by the dpg insert is inconsistent with the nucleation  elongation mechanism of aggregation featuring a monomeric  sheet nucleus rather the data support a mechanism of polyglutamine aggregation by which monomers associate into soluble oligomers which then undergo slow structural rearrangement to form sedimentable aggregates
