biochemical characterization of a clamp loader complex homologous to eukaryotic replication factor c from the hyperthermophilic archaeon sulfolobus solfataricus edited by m gottesman
here we report the isolation and characterization of a clamp loader complex from the thermoacidophilic archaeon sulfolobus solfataricus ssorfc  ssorfc is a hetero pentamer composed of polypeptides of  kda small subunit and  kda large subunit  which possess primary structure similarity with human replication factor c p  and p  subunits respectively the two ssorfc polypeptides were co expressed in escherichia coli and purified as a complex ssorfc complex that was demonstrated to possess a native mr of about   kda and a   small to large subunit stoichiometric ratio the small subunit was individually expressed in e coli purified and found to form a homo tetramer ssorfc small native mr   kda  which was also characterized the ssorfc complex but not ssorfc small highly stimulated the synthetic activity of s solfataricus b type dna polymerase in reactions containing primed m mp  dna atp and either of the two poliferating cell nuclear antigen like processivity factors of s solfataricus   p and  p  both ssorfc small and complex were able to hydrolyze atp but only the atpase activity of the holo enzymatic assembly was activated by primed dna templates such as poly da oligo dt  as measured by nitrocellulose filter binding assays ssorfc complex bound poly da oligo dt  but not the unprimed homopolymer whereas ssorfc small was devoid of any dna binding activity the peculiar properties of this archaeal clamp loader complex and their significance for the understanding of the dna replication process in archaea are discussed
