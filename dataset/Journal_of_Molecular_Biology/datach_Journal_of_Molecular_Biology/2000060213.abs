mutations at position a  of e coli  s ribosomal rna influence the structure of  s ribosomal rna and the peptidyltransferase region of  s ribosomal rna edited by d e draper
the proximity of loop d of  s rrna to two regions of  s rrna domain ii involved in translocation and domain v involved in peptide bond formation is known from previous cross linking experiments here we have used site directed mutagenesis and chemical probing to further define these contacts and possible sites of communication between  s and  s rrna three different mutants were constructed at position a   a highly conserved nucleotide in domain ii previously crosslinked to  s rrna and the mutant rrnas were expressed from plasmids as homogeneous populations of ribosomes in escherichia coli deficient in all seven chromosomal copies of the rrna operon mutations a  u a  g and particularly a  c caused structural rearrangements in the loop d of  s rrna and in the peptidyltransferase region of domain v as well as in the   loop itself these observations support the proposal that loop d of  s rrna participates in signal transmission between the ribosome centers responsible for peptide bond formation and translocation
