crystal structure of maba from mycobacterium tuberculosis a reductase involved in long chain fatty acid biosynthesis
the fatty acid elongation system fas ii is involved in the biosynthesis of mycolic acids which are major and specific long chain fatty acids of the cell envelope of mycobacterium tuberculosis and other mycobacteria including mycobacterium smegmatis the protein maba also named fabg  has been shown recently to be part of fas ii and to catalyse the nadph specific reduction of long chain  ketoacyl derivatives this activity corresponds to the second step of an fas ii elongation round fas ii is inhibited by the antituberculous drug isoniazid through the inhibition of the  trans enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase inha thus the other enzymes making up this enzymatic complex represent potential targets for designing new antituberculous drugs the crystal structure of the apo form maba was solved to    resolution by molecular replacement maba is tetrameric and shares the conserved fold of the short chain dehydrogenases reductases sdrs  however it exhibits some significant local rearrangements of the active site loops in the absence of a cofactor particulary the     region carrying the unique tryptophan residue in agreement with previous fluorescence spectroscopy data a similar conformation has been observed in the  ketoacyl reductase from escherichia coli and the distantly related dehydratase the distinctive enzymatic and structural properties of maba are discussed in view of its crystal structure and that of related enzymes
