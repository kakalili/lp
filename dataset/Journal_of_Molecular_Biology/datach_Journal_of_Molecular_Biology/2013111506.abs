blind prediction of charged ligand binding affinities in a model binding site
predicting absolute protein  ligand binding affinities remains a frontier challenge in ligand discovery and design this becomes more difficult when ionic interactions are involved because of the large opposing solvation and electrostatic attraction energies in a blind test we examined whether alchemical free energy calculations could predict binding affinities of  charged and  neutral compounds previously untested as ligands for a cavity binding site in cytochrome c peroxidase in this simplified site polar and cationic ligands compete with solvent to interact with a buried aspartate predictions were tested by calorimetry spectroscopy and crystallography of the  compounds predicted to bind   were experimentally confirmed while  compounds were false negative predictions predictions had a root mean square error of   kcal mol to the experimental affinities and predicted poses had an average rmsd of    to the crystallographic poses this test serves as a benchmark for these thermodynamically rigorous calculations at predicting binding affinities for charged compounds and gives insights into the existing sources of error which are primarily electrostatic interactions inside proteins our experiments also provide a useful set of ionic binding affinities in a simplified system for testing new affinity prediction methods
