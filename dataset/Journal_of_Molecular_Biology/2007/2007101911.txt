The BRAHMA (BRM) gene encodes the SNF2-type ATPase of the putative Arabidopsis thaliana SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex. This family of ATPases is characterized by the presence of a conserved catalytic domain and an arrangement of auxiliary domains, whose functions in the remodelling activity remains unclear. Here, we characterize, at the molecular and functional level, the carboxy-terminal part of Arabidopsis BRM. We have found three DNA-binding regions that bind various free DNA and nucleosomal probes with different specificity. One of these regions contains an AT-hook motif. The carboxy terminus also contains a bromodomain able to bind histones H3 and H4. We propose that this array of domains constitute a nucleosome interaction module that helps BRM to interact with its substrate. We also characterize an Arabidopsis mutant that expresses a BRM protein lacking the last 454 amino acid residues (BRM-Î”C), encompassing the bromodomain and two of the three DNA-binding activities identified. This mutant displays an intermediate phenotype between those of the wild-type and a null allele mutant, suggesting that the nucleosome interaction module is required for the normal function of BRM but it is not essential for the remodelling activity of BRM-containing SWI/SNF complexes.
