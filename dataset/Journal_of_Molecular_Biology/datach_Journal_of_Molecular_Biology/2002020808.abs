structure of c methyl d erythritol   cyclodiphosphate synthase involved in mevalonate independent biosynthesis of isoprenoids edited by a r fersht
isoprenoids are biosynthesized from isopentenyl diphosphate and the isomeric dimethylallyl diphosphate via the mevalonate pathway or a mevalonate independent pathway that was identified during the last decade the non mevalonate pathway is present in many bacteria some algae and in certain protozoa such as the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum and in the plastids of higher plants but not in mammals and archaea therefore these enzymes have been recognised as promising drug targets we report the crystal structure of escherichia coli c methyl d erythritol   cyclodiphosphate synthase ispf  which converts  diphosphocytidyl c methyl d erythritol  phosphate into c methyl d erythritol   cyclodiphosphate and cmp in a mg dependent reaction the protein forms homotrimers that tightly bind one zinc ion per subunit at the active site which helps to position the substrate for direct attack of the  phosphate group on the  phosphate
