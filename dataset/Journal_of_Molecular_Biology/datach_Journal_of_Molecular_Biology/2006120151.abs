key role of coulombic interactions for the folding transition state of the cold shock protein
the cold shock protein cspb shows a five stranded  sheet structure and it folds rapidly via a native like transition state a previous  value analysis showed that most of the residues with  values close to one reside in strand   and two of them lys and lys are partially exposed charged residues to elucidate how coulombic interactions of these two residues contribute to the energetic organisation of the folding transition state we performed comparative folding experiments in the presence of an ionic denaturant guanidinium chloride and a non ionic denaturant urea and a double mutant analysis lys contributes   kj mol   to the stability of the transition state and half of it originates from screenable coulombic interactions lys contributes   kj mol   and   kj mol   of it are screened by salt in the folded protein lys interacts with asp  and the screenable coulombic interaction between these two residues is fully formed in the transition state this suggests that long range coulombic interactions such as those originating from lys and lys of cspb can be important for organizing and stabilizing native like structure early in protein folding
