crystal structure of the resuscitation promoting factor  dufrpfb from m tuberculosis
mycobacterium tuberculosis is able to establish a non replicating state and survive in an intracellular habitat for years resuscitation of dormant m tuberculosis bacteria is promoted by resuscitation promoting factors rpfs  which are secreted from slowly replicating bacteria close to dormant bacteria here we report the crystal structure of a truncated form of rpfb residues       the sole indispensable rpf of the five rpfs encoded in this bacterium genome the structure denoted as  dufrpfb exhibits a comma like shape formed by a lysozyme like globular catalytic domain and an elongated g domain which is widespread among cell surface binding proteins the g domain whose structure was previously uncharacterised presents some peculiar features the basic structural motif of this domain which represents the tail of the comma like structure is a novel super secondary structure element made of two  sheets interconnected by a pseudo triple helix this intricate organisation leads to the exposure of several backbone hydrogen bond donors acceptors mutagenesis analyses and solution studies indicate that this protein construct as well as the full length form are elongated monomeric proteins although  dufrpfb does not self associate the exposure of structural elements backbone h bond donors acceptors and hydrophobic side chains that are usually buried in globular proteins is typically associated with adhesive properties this suggests that the rpfb g domain has a cell wall adhesive function which allows the catalytic domain to be properly oriented for the cleavage reaction interestingly sequence comparisons indicate that these structural features are also shared by g domains involved in biofilm formation
