structural characterization of the active and inactive states of src kinase in solution by small angle x ray scattering
src kinase plays an important role in several signaling and regulation mechanisms in vivo enzymatic activity is tightly regulated through the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of tyrosine   which is placed at the c terminal tail here we have addressed domain rearrangements involved in the regulation mechanism of src kinase in solution using small angle x ray scattering in the phosphorylated wild type form of src kinase corresponding to the inactive state of the protein a single conformation compatible with a closed crystallographic structure was found in solution in the y  f point mutant representing the active state analysis of scattering data reveals an equilibrium between two differently populated conformations differing in the radius of gyration by    the major species   of the total population presents a closed conformation indistinguishable from the crystallographic structure of the inactive state the minor species   of the total population is an open conformation similar to the crystallographic structure in the active state the latter structure has the sh  sh  and sh catalytic domain linker assembled as a pseudo two domain protein the regulation model emerging from this study including at least three different conformational states allows the tight regulation of the enzyme without compromising fast response in the presence of natural targets
