enterohaemorrhagic e coli modulates an arf rab  signaling axis to prevent recycling endosome maturation during infection
enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli epec ehec manipulate a plethora of host cell processes to establish infection of the gut mucosa this manipulation is achieved via the injection of bacterial effector proteins into host cells using a type iii secretion system we have previously reported that the conserved ehec and epec effector espg disrupts recycling endosome function reducing cell surface levels of host receptors through accumulation of recycling cargo within the host cell here we report that espg interacts specifically with the small gtpases arf and rab  during infection these interactions target espg to endosomes and prevent rab  mediated recycling of cargo to the host cell surface furthermore we show that espg has no effect on rab  mediated uncoating of newly formed endosomes and instead leads to the formation of enlarged espg tfr rab  positive eea clathrin negative stalled recycling structures thus this paper provides a molecular framework to explain how espg disrupts recycling whilst also reporting the first known simultaneous targeting of arf and rab  by a bacterial pathogen
