structure and function of the conserved   hairpin in escherichia coli  s ribosomal rna analysis of the stem nucleotides edited by d e draper
nucleotides   to   of escherichia coli  s rrna form a distinct structural domain required for ribosome function the goal of this study was to determine the functional significance of pairing interactions in the   region two different secondary structures were proposed for this hairpin based on phylogenetic and chemical modification studies to study the effect of pairing interactions in the   hairpin on ribosome function and to determine which of the proposed secondary structures is biologically significant we performed an instant evolution experiment in which the nine nucleotides that form the proposed base pairs and dangling ends of the   stem were randomly mutated and functional mutant combinations were selected a total of  unique functional mutants were isolated assayed in vivo and sequenced analysis of these data revealed extensive base pairing and stacking interactions among the mutated nucleotides formation of either a watson crick base pair or g u pair between positions   and   is absolutely required for ribosome function we also performed nmr studies of a  nucleotide rna which indicate the formation of a functionally important base pair between nucleotides   and   formation of a second base pair between positions   and   however is not essential for ribosome function but the level of ribosome function correlates with the predicted thermodynamic stability of the nucleotide pairs in these positions the universally conserved positions g  and u  are generally portrayed as forming a g u mismatch our data show co variation between these positions but do not support the hypothesis that the g  u  pair forms a wobble structure nmr studies of model  nt and  nt rnas support these findings and show that g  and u  are involved in unusual stacking interactions but do not form a wobble pair preliminary nmr structural analysis reveals that the loop portion of the   hairpin folds into a highly structured and novel conformation
