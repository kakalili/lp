Prefoldin is a heterohexameric molecular chaperone complex that is found in the eukaryotic cytosol and also in archaea. It captures a nonnative protein and subsequently delivers it to a group II chaperonin for proper folding. Archaeal prefoldin is a heterocomplex containing two α subunits and four β subunits with the structure of a double β-barrel assembly, with six long coiled coils protruding from it like a jellyfish with six tentacles. We have studied the protein folding mechanism of group II chaperonin using those of Thermococcus sp. strain KS-1 (T. KS-1) because they exhibit high protein folding activity in vitro. We have also demonstrated functional cooperation between T. KS-1 chaperonins and prefoldin from Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3. Recent genome analysis has shown that Thermococcus kodakaraensis KOD1 contains two pairs of prefoldin subunit genes, correlating with the existence of two different chaperonin subunits. In this study, we characterized four different recombinant prefoldin complexes composed of two pairs of prefoldin subunits (α1, α2, β1, and β2) from T. KS-1. All of them (α1–β1, α2–β1, α1–β2, and α2–β2) exist as α2β4 heterohexamers and can protect several proteins from forming aggregates with different activities. We have also compared the collaborative activity between the prefoldin complexes and the cognate chaperonins. Prefoldin complexes containing the β1 subunit interacted with the chaperonins more strongly than those with the β2 subunit. The results suggest that Thermococcus spp. express different prefoldins for different substrates or conditions as chaperonins.
