recognition of cello oligosaccharides by a family  carbohydrate binding module an x ray crystallographic thermodynamic and mutagenic study edited by r huber
the crystal structure of the clostridium cellulovorans carbohydrate binding module cbm belonging to family  has been solved to    resolution by multiple anomalous dispersion methods cbm  binds to non crystalline cellulose and soluble    glucans with a minimal binding requirement of cellotriose and optimal affinity for cellohexaose the crystal structure of cbm  complexed with cellotetraose solved at    resolution revealed that binding occurs in a cleft on the surface of the molecule involving two tryptophan residues and several charged amino acids thermodynamic binding studies and alanine scanning mutagenesis in combination with the cellotetraose complex structure allowed the mapping of the cbm  binding cleft in contrast to the binding groove characteristic of family  cbms family  cbms appear to have a very shallow binding cleft that may be more accessible to cellulose chains in non crystalline cellulose than the deeper binding clefts of family  cbms the structural differences in these two modules may reflect non overlapping binding niches on cellulose surfaces
