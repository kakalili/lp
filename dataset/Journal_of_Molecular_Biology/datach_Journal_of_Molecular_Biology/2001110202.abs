chaperonin mediated de novo generation of prion protein aggregates edited by w baumeister
the infectious prion protein prpsc a predominantly  sheet aggregate is derived from prpc the largely  helical cellular isoform of prp conformational conversion of prpc into prpsc has been suggested to involve a chaperone like factor here we report that the bacterial chaperonin groel a close homolog of eukaryotic hsp  can catalyze the aggregation of chemically denatured and of folded recombinant prp in a model reaction in vitro aggregates form upon atp dependent release of prp from chaperonin and have certain properties of prpsc including a high  sheet content the ability to bind the dye congo red detergent insolubility and increased protease resistance a conserved sequence segment of prp residues     critical for prpsc generation in vivo is also required for chaperonin mediated aggregate formation in vitro initial binding of refolded   helical prp to chaperonin is mediated by the unstructured n terminal segment of prp residues     and is followed by a rearrangement of the globular prp core domain these results show that chaperonins of the hsp  class can in principle mediate prp aggregation de novo i e independently of a pre existent prpsc template
