refined crystallographic structure of pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin a and its implications for the molecular mechanism of toxicity edited by d rees
exotoxin a of pseudomonas aeruginosa asserts its cellular toxicity through adp ribosylation of translation elongation factor  predicated on binding to specific cell surface receptors and intracellular trafficking via a complex pathway that ultimately results in translocation of an enzymatic activity into the cytoplasm in early work the crystallographic structure of exotoxin a was determined to    resolution revealing a tertiary fold having three distinct structural domains subsequent work has shown that the domains are individually responsible for the receptor binding domain i  transmembrane targeting domain ii  and adp ribosyl transferase domain iii activities respectively here we report the structures of wild type and w  a mutant toxin proteins at ph   refined with data to     and     resolution respectively the refined models clarify several ionic interactions within structural domains i and ii that may modulate an obligatory conformational change that is induced by low ph proteolytic cleavage by furin is also obligatory for toxicity the w  a mutant protein is substantially more susceptible to cleavage than the wild type toxin the tertiary structures of the furin cleavage sites of the wild type and w  mutant toxins are similar however the mutant toxin has significantly higher b factors around the cleavage site suggesting that the greater susceptibility to furin cleavage is due to increased local disorder flexibility at the site rather than to differences in static tertiary structure comparison of the refined structures of full length toxin which lacks adp ribosyl transferase activity to that of the enzymatic domain alone reveals a salt bridge between arg  of the catalytic domain and glu  of domain ii that restrains the substrate binding cleft in a conformation that precludes nad binding the refined structures of exotoxin a provide precise models for the design and interpretation of further studies of the mechanism of intoxication
