directed evolution of dna polymerase rna polymerase and reverse transcriptase activity in a single polypeptide
dna polymerases enable key technologies in modern biology but for many applications native polymerases are limited by their stringent substrate recognition here we describe short patch compartmentalized self replication spcsr  a novel strategy to expand the substrate spectrum of polymerases in a targeted way spcsr is based on the previously described csr but unlike csr only a short region a  patch   of the gene under investigation is diversified and replicated this allows the selection of polymerases under conditions where catalytic activity and processivity are compromised to the extent that full self replication is inefficient we targeted two specific motifs involved in substrate recognition in the active site of dna polymerase i from thermus aquaticus taq and selected for incorporation of both ribonucleotide  ntp and deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates dntps using spcsr this allowed the isolation of multiple variants of taq with apparent dual substrate specificity they were able to synthesize rna while still retaining essentially wild type wt dna polymerase activity as judged by pcr one such mutant aa  e  v a  v i  m e  g was able to incorporate both ntps and dntps with the same catalytic efficiency as the wt enzyme incorporates dntps aa  allowed the generation of mixed rna  dna amplification products in pcr demonstrating dna polymerase rna polymerase as well as reverse transcriptase activity within the same polypeptide furthermore aa  displayed an expanded substrate spectrum towards other   substituted nucleotides and was able to synthesize nucleic acid polymers in which each base bore a different   substituent our results suggest that spcsr will be a powerful strategy for the generation of polymerases with altered substrate specificity for applications in nano and biotechnology and in the enzymatic synthesis of antisense and rnai probes
