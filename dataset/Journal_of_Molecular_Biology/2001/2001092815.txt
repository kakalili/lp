We identify and characterize several phosphorylated forms of the hSpt5 subunit of the DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF). A 175-kDa phosphorylated form of hSpt5 is bound to nuclei of interphase HeLa cells. This form is rapidly dephosphorylated when cultured cells are exposed to various drugs belonging to distinct chemical families. All these compounds are known to inhibit the protein kinase Cdk9, which phosphorylates in vitro hSpt5 and Rpb1, the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II. The efficiency to promote the dephosphorylation of both proteins matches their capacity to inhibit purified Cdk9 kinase, suggesting that Cdk9 is the major kinase phosphorylating hSpt5 and Rpb1 in vivo. We show that Cdk9 phosphorylates both the CTR1 and the CTR2 domains of recombinant hSpt5. These domains contain numerous serine-proline and threonine-proline residues similar to those found in the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of Rpb1. The structural homology between hSpt5 CTRs and the Rpb1 CTD is further highlighted by the presence on both proteins of a phosphoepitope recognized by the monoclonal antibody CC-3. Of particular interest, the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 interacts with Cdk9-phosphorylated hSpt5. Cdk9 dependent phosphorylation of Rpb1 and hSpt5 followed by Pin1 interaction might thus contribute to the regulation of transcription, pre-mRNA maturation, and the dynamics of these proteins in interphase and mitosis.
