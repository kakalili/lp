the energetics of consensus promoter opening by t rna polymerase
the consensus  base pair t dna promoter is classically divided into two domains an upstream binding domain    to    and a downstream initiation domain    to   relative to the transcription start site at   during transcription initiation t rna polymerase t rnap melts specifically the   to    tatagg g region of the duplex dna promoter to form a pre initiation open complex no external energy source is used and the energy for open complex formation is derived from the free energy of specific interactions with the binding domain particularly the specificity region    to    using  aminopurine fluorescence based equilibrium and kinetic measurements we have measured the binding affinities of various topologically modified dna promoters  bp in length that represent initial final and transition state analogs of the promoter dna in the t rnap  dna complex to determine the energy of specific binding interactions and the energy required for forming an initiation bubble the results indicate that     kcalmol   of free energy is made available upon t rnap binding through specificity loop to the promoter binding domain to melt the tatagg g sequence   kcalmol   of free energy is utilized this compares with   kcalmol   predicted from nearest neighbor analysis the remaining     kcalmol   of net free energy is retained for stabilization of the specific pre initiation binary complex of the   kcalmol   energy that is used to generate the pre initiation dna bubble in the open complex we estimate that one half     kcalmol   is utilized for nucleation deformation process through bending untwisting etc  in the melting region    to   tata of the initiation domain    to   and appears to be independent of the nucleation site within this region the other half is utilized in unpairing the  to    gg g sequence for initiation the interactions of t rnap with a  bp non specific dna on the other hand are very weak  g lt   kcalmol    which is not sufficient to melt and stabilize an open complex of a non specific dna
