calorimetric and spectroscopic studies of hoechst    self association and binding to non cognate dna
sequence and structure specific molecular recognition of dna by small molecules is an important goal in biophysical chemistry and drug discovery many candidate ligands possess flat aromatic surfaces and other molecular features that allow them to self associate in addition non specific binding to the target is a complicating feature of these interactions therefore multiple equilibria are present and need to be accounted for in data analysis in order to obtain meaningful thermodynamic parameters in order to address these issues we have systematically examined the bis benzimidazole dye hoechst    h    in terms of self aggregation and binding to dna oligonucleotides lacking any cognate minor groove a t sites this model system has been interrogated using isothermal titration calorimetry itc  circular dichroism cd  fluorescence spectroscopy and pulsed gradient spin echo nmr three distinct binding events and ligand self aggregation have been identified and where possible quantified h   self aggregation involves a step wise aggregation mechanism driven by stacking interactions the dna binding process includes two specific binding modes and non specific dna templated h   stacking we have written novel itc data fitting software ic itc freely available to the biophysics community  which simultaneously fits ligand aggregation and ligand  dna binding here this numerical analysis which uses simulated annealing of complex calorimetric data representing multiple coupled equilibria is described
