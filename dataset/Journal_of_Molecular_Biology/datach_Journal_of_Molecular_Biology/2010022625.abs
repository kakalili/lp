crystal structure of the light driven chloride pump halorhodopsin from natronomonas pharaonis
the light driven chloride pump halorhodopsin from natronomonas pharaonis phr crystallised into the monoclinic space group c  with a phr trimer per the asymmetric unit diffraction data at    resolution showed that the carotenoid bacterioruberin binds to crevices between adjacent protein subunits in the trimeric assembly besides seven transmembrane helices a to g that characterise archaeal rhodopsins the phr protomer possesses an amphipathic  helix a   at the n terminus this helix together with a long loop between helices b and c forms a hydrophobic cap that covers the extracellular surface and prevents a rapid ion exchange between the active centre and the extracellular medium the retinal bound to lys  in helix g takes on an all trans configuration with the schiff base being hydrogen bonded to a water molecule the schiff base also interacts with asp  and a chloride ion the latter being fixed by two polar groups thr  and ser   in helix c in the anion uptake pathway four ionisable residues arg   glu   arg  and his   and seven water molecules are aligned to form a long hydrogen bonding network conversely the cytoplasmic half is filled mostly by hydrophobic residues forming a large energetic barrier against the transport of anion the height of this barrier would be lowered substantially if the cytoplasmic half functions as a proton hcl antiporter interestingly there is a long cavity extending from the main chain carbonyl of lys  to thr  in helix b this cavity which is commonly seen in halobacterial light driven proton pumps is one possible pathway that is utilised for a water mediated proton transfer from the cytoplasmic medium to the anion which is relocated to the cytoplasmic channel during the photocycle
