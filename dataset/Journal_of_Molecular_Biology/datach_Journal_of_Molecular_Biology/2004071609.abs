crystal structure of the drosophila peptidoglycan recognition protein pgrp sa at    resolution
peptidoglycan recognition proteins pgrps form a recently discovered protein family which is conserved from insect to mammals and is implicated in the innate immune system by interacting with or degrading microbial peptidoglycans pgns  drosophila pgrp sa is a member of this family of pattern recognition receptors and is involved in insect toll activation we report here the crystal structure of pgrp sa at    resolution which represents the first example of a  recognition  pgrp comparison with the catalytic drosophila pgrp lb reveals an overall structure conservation with an l shaped hydrophilic groove that is likely the pgn carbohydrate core binding site but further suggests some possible functional homology between recognition and catalytic pgrps consistent with sequence analysis pgrp sa does not contain the canonical zinc binding residues found in catalytic pgrps however substitution of the zinc binding cysteine residue by serine along with an altered coordinating histidine residue assembles a constellation of residues that resembles a modified catalytic triad the serine histidine juxtaposition to a threonine residue and a carbonyl oxygen atom along with conservation of the catalytic water molecule found in pgrp lb tantalizingly suggests some hydrolytic function for this member of receptor pgrps
