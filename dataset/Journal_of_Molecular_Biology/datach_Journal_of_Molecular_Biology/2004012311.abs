temperature dependence of the thermodynamics of helix  coil transition
the temperature induced helix to coil transition in a series of host peptides was monitored using circular dichroism spectroscopy cd and differential scanning calorimetry dsc  combination of these two techniques allowed direct determination of the enthalpy of helix  coil transition for the studied peptides it was found that the enthalpy of the helix  coil transition differs for different peptides and this difference is related to the difference in the temperature for the midpoint of helix  coil transition the enthalpy of the helix  coil transition decreases with the increase in temperature thus providing the first experimental estimate for the heat capacity changes upon helix  coil transition  cp the values for  cp of helix  coil transition are found to be negative which is in contrast to the positive  cp for protein unfolding analysis suggests that this negative  cp of helix  coil transition is due to the exposure of the polar peptide backbone to solvent upon helix unfolding
