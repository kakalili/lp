domain topology of the p  complex within the  d architecture of the nuclear pore complex
the nuclear pore complex npc is the only known gateway for exchange of macromolecules between the cytoplasm and nucleus of eukaryotic cells one key compound of the npc is the p  subcomplex which consists of the nucleoporins p  p  and p  p  and is supposed to be involved in nuclear protein import and export here we show the localization of distinct domains of the p  complex by immuno electron microscopy using isolated nuclei from xenopus oocytes to determine the exact position of the p  complex we examined the localization of the c and n terminal domains of p  by immunogold labeling using domain specific antibodies against p  in addition we expressed epitope tagged versions of p  p  and p  in xenopus oocytes and localized the domains with antibodies against the tags this first systematic analysis of the domain topology of the p  complex within the npc revealed that the p  complex is anchored to the cytoplasmic face of the npc most likely by the coiled coil domains of the three nucleoporins furthermore we found the phenylalanine glycine fg repeat domain of p  but not of p  and p  to be of mobile and flexible nature
