functional and structural characterization of hiv  gp  ectodomain regions in phospholipid membranes suggests that the fusion active conformation is extended
hiv  entry into its host cell involves a sequential interaction whereby gp  is in direct contact with the plasma membrane understanding the effect of membrane composition on the fusion mechanism can shed light on the unsolved phases of this complex mechanism here we studied n  a peptide derived from the n heptad repeat nhr of the gp  ectodomain its six helix bundle shb forming counterpart c  together with the n terminal  mer wild type peptide n   and additional gp  ectodomain derived peptides in the presence of two membranes modeling inner and outer leaflets of the plasma membrane information on the structure of these peptides their affinity towards phospholipids and their ability to induce vesicle fusion was gathered by a variety of fluorescence spectroscopic and microscopy methods we found that n  having strong affinity towards phospholipids prominently shifts conformation from  helix in an outer leaflet like zwitterionic membrane to  sheet in a membrane mimicking the negatively charged inner leaflet environment leading to pronounced fusion activity real time atomic force microscopy afm was used to study the peptides effect on the membrane morphology revealing severe bilayer perturbation and extensive pore formation we also found that the n  c  core is destabilized by electronegative but not zwitterionic phospholipids taken together our data suggest that the fusion active pore forming conformation of gp  is extended upstream of the shb in this manner folding of the ectodomain into a shb might also serve as a negative regulator of fusion by impeding gp  fusion active surfaces thus preventing irreversible damage to the cell membrane this assumption is supported by the finding that pre incubation of large unilamellar vesicles luv with c heptad repeat chr derived fusion inhibitors reduces the fusogenic activity of n terminal peptides in a dose dependant manner and suggests that chr derived fusion inhibitors inhibit hiv entry in an analogous mechanism
