small angle x ray scattering reveals the n terminal domain organization of cardiac myosin binding protein c
myosin binding protein c mybp c is a multidomain accessory protein of striated muscle sarcomeres three domains at the n terminus of mybp c c  m  c  play a crucial role in maintaining and modulating actomyosin interactions the cardiac isoform has an additional n terminal domain c  that is postulated to provide a greater level of regulatory control in cardiac muscle we have used small angle x ray scattering ab initio shape restoration and rigid body modeling to determine the average shape and spatial arrangement of the four n terminal domains of cardiac mybp c c c  and a three domain variant that is analogous to the n terminus of the skeletal isoform c c  we found that the domains of both proteins are tandemly arranged in a highly extended configuration that is sufficiently long to span the interfilament cross bridge distances in vivo and hence be poised to modulate these interactions the average spatial organization of the c  m and c domains is not significantly perturbed by the removal of the cardiac specific c domain suggesting that the interdomain interfaces while relatively small in area have a degree of rigidity modeling the c c and c c scattering data reveals that the structures of the c and m domains also referred to as the  mybp motif   are compact and have dimensions that are consistent with the immunoglobulin fold superfamily of proteins sequence analysis homology modeling and circular dichroism experiments support the conclusion that the previously undetermined structures of these domains can be characterized as having an immunoglobulin like fold atomic models using the known nmr structures for c and c as well as homology models for the c and m domains provide insights into the placement of conserved serine residues of the m domain that are phosphorylated in vivo and cause a change in muscle fiber contraction by abolishing interactions with myosin
