nmr structure of cysteinyl phosphorylated enzyme iib of the n n  diacetylchitobiose specific phosphoenolpyruvate dependent phosphotransferase system of escherichia coli edited by p e wright
the determination by nmr of the solution structure of the phosphorylated enzyme iib p iibchb of the n n  diacetylchitobiose specific phosphoenolpyruvate dependent phosphotransferase system of escherichia coli is presented most of the backbone and side chain resonances were assigned using a variety of mostly heteronuclear nmr experiments the remaining resonances were assigned with the help of the structure calculations noe derived distance restraints were used in distance geometry calculations followed by molecular dynamics and simulated annealing protocols in addition combinations of ambiguous restraints were used to resolve ambiguities in the noe assignments by combining sets of ambiguous and unambiguous restraints into new ambiguous restraints an error function was constructed that was less sensitive to information loss caused by assignment uncertainties the final set of structures had a pairwise rmsd of     and     for the heavy atoms of the backbone and side chains respectively comparing the p iibchb solution structure with the previously determined nmr and x ray structures of the wild type and the cys ser mutant shows that significant differences between the structures are limited to the active site region the phosphoryl group at the active site cysteine residue is surrounded by a loop formed by residues  through   noe and chemical shift data suggest that the phosphoryl group makes hydrogen bonds with the backbone amide protons of residues  and   the binding mode of the phosphoryl group is very similar to that of the protein tyrosine phosphatases the differences observed are in accordance with the presumption that iibchb has to be more resistant to hydrolysis than the protein tyrosine phosphatases we propose a proton relay network by which a transfer occurs between the cysteine sh proton and the solvent via the hydroxyl group of thr
