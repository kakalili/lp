profeat update a protein features web server with added facility to compute network descriptors for studying omics derived networks
the studies of biological disease and pharmacological networks are facilitated by the systems level investigations using computational tools in particular the network descriptors developed in other disciplines have found increasing applications in the study of the protein gene regulatory metabolic disease and drug targeted networks facilities are provided by the public web servers for computing network descriptors but many descriptors are not covered including those used or useful for biological studies we upgraded the profeat web server http  bidd nus edu sg cgi bin profeat   main cgi for computing up to   network descriptors and protein  protein interaction descriptors profeat network descriptors comprehensively describe the topological and connectivity characteristics of unweighted uniform binding constants and molecular levels  edge weighted varying binding constants  node weighted varying molecular levels  edge node weighted varying binding constants and molecular levels  and directed oriented processes networks the usefulness of the network descriptors is illustrated by the literature reported studies of the biological networks derived from the genome interactome transcriptome metabolome and diseasome profiles
