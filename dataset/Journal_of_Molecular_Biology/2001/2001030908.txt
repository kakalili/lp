DNA gyrase catalyses DNA supercoiling by passing one segment of DNA (the T segment) through another (the G segment) in a reaction coupled to the binding and hydrolysis of ATP. The N-terminal domains of the gyrase B dimer constitute an ATP-operated clamp that is proposed to capture the T segment during the DNA supercoiling reaction. We have locked this clamp in the closed conformation using the non-hydrolysable ATP analogue ADPNP (5′-adenylyl β,γ-imidodiphosphate). The clamp-locked enzyme is able to bind and cleave DNA, albeit at a reduced level. Although the locked enzyme is not capable of carrying out DNA supercoiling, it can catalyse limited DNA relaxation, consistent with the ability to complete one strand passage event per enzyme molecule via entry of the T segment through the exit gate of the enzyme. The DNA-protein complex of the clamp-locked enzyme has a conformation that differs from the normal positively wrapped conformation of the gyrase-DNA complex. These experiments confirm the role of the ATP-operated clamp in the strand-passage reactions of gyrase and suggest a model for the interaction of DNA with gyrase in which a conformation with the T segment in equilibrium across the DNA gate can be achieved via T-segment entry through the ATP-operated clamp or through the exit gate.
