the anatomy of protein  sheet topology edited by j thornton
here we present a systematic analysis of the open faced  sheet topologies in a set of non redundant protein domain structures in particular we focus on the topological diversity of four stranded  sheet motifs of the  topologies that are possible for a four stranded  sheet   were identified in known protein structures of these four account for   of the structures that we have studied two sets of the topologies that were not observed may represent the section of the topological space that is not readily accessible to proteins on either thermodynamic or kinetic grounds the first set contains topologies with alternating parallel and antiparallel  ladders their rare occurrence reflects the expectation that it is energetically unfavorable to match different hydrogen bonding patterns the polypeptide chains in the second set of topologies go through convoluted paths and are expected to experience great kinetic frustrations during the folding processes a knowledge of the potential causes for the topological preference of small  sheets also helps us to understand the topological properties of larger  sheet structures which frequently contain four stranded motifs the notion that protein topologies can only be taken from a confined and discrete space has important implications for structural genomics
