x ray and neutron small angle scattering analysis of the complex formed by the met receptor and the listeria monocytogenes invasion protein inlb
the listeria monocytogenes surface protein inlb binds to the extracellular domain of the human receptor tyrosine kinase met the product of the c met proto oncogene inlb binding activates the met receptor leading to uptake of listeria into normally nonphagocytic host cells the n terminal half of inlb inlb   is sufficient for met binding and activation the complex between this met binding domain of inlb and various constructs of the met ectodomain was characterized by size exclusion chromatography and dynamic light scattering and structural models were built using small angle x ray scattering and small angle neutron scattering although most receptor tyrosine kinase ligands induce receptor dimerization inlb  consistently binds the met ectodomain with a   stoichiometry a construct comprising the sema and psi domains of met although sufficient to bind the physiological met ligand hepatocyte growth factor scatter factor does not form a complex with inlb  in solution highlighting the importance of met ig domains for inlb binding small angle x ray scattering and small angle neutron scattering measurements of ligand and receptor both free and in complex reveal an elongated shape for the receptor the four ig domains form a bent rather than a fully extended conformation and inlb  binds to sema and the first ig domain of met in agreement with the recent crystal structure of a smaller met fragment in complex with inlb   these results call into question whether receptor dimerization is the basic underlying event in inlb  mediated met activation and demonstrate differences in the mechanisms by which the physiological ligand hepatocyte growth factor scatter factor and inlb  bind and activate the met receptor
