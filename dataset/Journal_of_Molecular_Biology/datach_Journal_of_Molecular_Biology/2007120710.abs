plasma membrane porating domain in poliovirus b protein a short peptide mimics viroporin activity
picornavirus b a non structural protein required for effective viral replication has been implicated in cell membrane permeabilization during the late phases of infection here we have approached the molecular mechanism of this process by assessing the pore forming activity of an overlapping peptide library that spanned the complete b sequence at non cytopathic concentrations only the p peptide spanning b residues     effectively assembled hydrophilic pores that allowed diffusion of low molecular mass solutes across the cell plasma membrane ic        m and boundary liposome bilayers starting at peptide to lipid molar ratios gt     circular dichroism data were consistent with its capacity to fold as a helix in a membrane like environment furthermore addition of this peptide to a sealed plasma membrane model consisting of retinal rod outer segments patch clamped in a whole cell configuration induced ion channel activity within seconds at concentrations as low as    m thus we have established a  one helix   b version that possesses the intrinsic pore forming activity required to directly and effectively permeabilize the cell plasma membrane we conclude that b viroporin can be classified as a genuine pore forming toxin of viral origin which is produced intracellularly at certain times post infection
