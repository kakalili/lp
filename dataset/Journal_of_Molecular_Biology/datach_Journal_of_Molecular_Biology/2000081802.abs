multiple roles of prolyl residues in structure and folding edited by c robert matthews
to explore the ways that proline residues may influence the conformational options of a polypeptide backbone we have characterized pro  ala mutants of cellular retinoic acid binding protein i crabp i  while all three xaa pro bonds are in the trans conformation in the native protein and the equilibrium stability of each mutant is similar to that of the parent protein each has distinct effects on folding and unfolding kinetics the mutation of pro  does not alter the kinetics of folding of crabp i which indicates that the flexible loop containing this residue is passive in the folding process by contrast replacement of pro  by ala abolishes the observable slow phase of folding revealing that correct configuration of the     peptide bond is prerequisite to productive folding substitution of pro  by ala yields a protein that folds and unfolds more slowly removal of the conformational constraint imposed by the proline ring likely raises the transition state barrier by increasing the entropic cost of narrowing the conformational ensemble additionally the pro  ala mutation removes a helix termination signal that is important for efficient folding to the native state
