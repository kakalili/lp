role of  subunit n and c termini in assembly of the mitochondrial atp synthase in yeast
the  subunit is required for the assembly of atp synthases and plays a crucial role in their catalytic activity we stepwise shortened the n terminus and the c terminus of the  subunit in the mitochondrial atp synthase of yeast and investigated the relevance of these segments in the assembly of the enzyme and in the growth of the cells we found that a deletion of  residues at the n terminus or  residues at the c terminus still allowed efficient import of the subunit into mitochondria however the assembly of both monomeric and dimeric holoenzymes was partially impaired   subunits lacking  n terminal residues or  c terminal residues were not assembled yeast strains expressing either of the truncated  subunits did not grow on non fermentable carbon sources indicating that non assembled parts of the atp synthase accumulated and impaired essential mitochondrial functions
