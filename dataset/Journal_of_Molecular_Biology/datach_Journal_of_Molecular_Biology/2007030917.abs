structure function analysis of a bacterial deoxyadenosine kinase reveals the basis for substrate specificity
deoxyribonucleoside kinases dnks catalyze the transfer of a phosphoryl group from atp to a deoxyribonucleoside dn  a key step in dna precursor synthesis recently structural information concerning dnks has been obtained but no structure of a bacterial dck dgk enzyme is known here we report the structure of such an enzyme represented by deoxyadenosine kinase from mycoplasma mycoides subsp mycoides small colony type mm dak  superposition of mm dak with its human counterpart s deoxyguanosine kinase dgk and deoxycytidine kinase dck reveals that the overall structures are very similar with a few amino acid alterations in the proximity of the active site to investigate the substrate specificity mm dak has been crystallized in complex with datp and dctp as well as the products dcmp and dcdp both datp and dctp bind to the enzyme in a feedback inhibitory manner with the dn part in the deoxyribonucleoside binding site and the triphosphates in the p loop substrate specificity studies with clinically important nucleoside analogs as well as several phosphate donors were performed thus in this study we combine structural and kinetic data to gain a better understanding of the substrate specificity of the dck dgk family of enzymes the structure of mm dak provides a starting point for making new anti bacterial agents against pathogenic bacteria
