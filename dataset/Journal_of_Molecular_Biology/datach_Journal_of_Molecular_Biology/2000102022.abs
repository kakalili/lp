crystal structures of the chromosomal proteins sso d sac d bound to dna containing t g mismatched base pairs edited by i tinoco
sso d and sac d are two small chromatin proteins from the hyperthermophilic archaeabacterium sulfolobus solfataricus and sulfolobus acidocaldarius respectively the crystal structures of sso d gtgatcgc sac d gtgatcgc and sac d gtgatcac have been determined and refined at         and     respectively to investigate the dna binding property of sso d sac d in the presence of a t g mismatch base pair detailed structural analysis revealed that the intercalation site includes the t g mismatch base pair and sso d sac d bind to that mismatch base pair in a manner similar to regular dna in the sso d gtgatcgc complex a new inter strand hydrogen bond between t o and c n is formed and well order bridging water molecules are found the results suggest that the less stable dna stacking site involving a t g mismatch may be a preferred site for protein side chain intercalation
