amyloid fibril formation and disaggregation of fragment   of apomyoglobin insights into the effect of ph on protein fibrillogenesis
the n terminal fragment    of horse heart apomyoglobin apomb    is highly prone to form amyloid like fibrils at low ph fibrillogenesis at ph   occurs following a nucleation dependent growth mechanism as evidenced by the thioflavin t tht assay transmission electron microscopy tem confirms the presence of regular amyloid like fibrils and far uv circular dichroism cd spectra indicate the acquisition of a high content of  sheet structure tht assay tem and cd highlight fast and complete disaggregation of the fibrils if the ph of a suspension of mature fibrils is increased to   it is of interest that amyloid like fibrils form again if the ph of the solution is brought back to   while apomb    fibrils obtained at ph   are resistant to proteolysis by pepsin the disaggregated fibrils are easily cleaved at ph   by trypsin and v protease and some of the resulting fragments aggregate very quickly in the proteolysis mixture forming amyloid like fibrils we show that the increase of amyloidogenicity of apomb    following acidification or proteolysis at ph   can be attributed to the decrease of the peptide net charge following these alterations the results observed here for apomb    provide an experimental basis for explaining the effect of charge and ph on amyloid fibril formation by both unfolded and folded protein systems
