converting a marginally hydrophobic soluble protein into a membrane protein
helices are marginally hydrophobic  helical segments in soluble proteins that exhibit certain sequence characteristics of transmembrane tm helices cunningham f  rath a  johnson r m  amp deber c m     distinctions between hydrophobic helices in globular proteins and tm segments as factors in protein sorting j biol chem           in order to better understand the difference between  helices and tm helices we have studied the insertion of five tm like  helices into dog pancreas microsomal membranes using model constructs in which an isolated  helix is engineered into a bona fide membrane protein we find that for two  helices originating from secreted proteins at least three single nucleotide mutations are necessary to obtain efficient membrane insertion whereas one mutation is sufficient in a  helix from the cytosolic protein p  bm  we further find that only when the entire upstream region of the mutated  helix in the intact cytochrome p  bm  is deleted does a small fraction of the truncated protein insert into microsomes our results suggest that upstream portions of the polypeptide as well as embedded charged residues protect  helices in globular proteins from being recognized by the signal recognition particle  sec  endoplasmic reticulum targeting machinery and that  helices in secreted proteins are mutationally more distant from tm helices than  helices in cytosolic proteins
