predicting transmembrane protein topology with a hidden markov model application to complete genomes edited by f cohen
we describe and validate a new membrane protein topology prediction method tmhmm based on a hidden markov model we present a detailed analysis of tmhmm  s performance and show that it correctly predicts      of the transmembrane helices additionally tmhmm can discriminate between soluble and membrane proteins with both specificity and sensitivity better than    although the accuracy drops when signal peptides are present this high degree of accuracy allowed us to predict reliably integral membrane proteins in a large collection of genomes based on these predictions we estimate that      of all genes in most genomes encode membrane proteins which is in agreement with previous estimates we further discovered that proteins with nin cin topologies are strongly preferred in all examined organisms except caenorhabditis elegans where the large number of tm receptors increases the counts for nout cin topologies we discuss the possible relevance of this finding for our understanding of membrane protein assembly mechanisms a tmhmm prediction service is available at http  www cbs dtu dk services tmhmm
