high resolution structure of the nitrile reductase quef combined with molecular simulations provide insight into enzyme mechanism
here we report the     crystal structure of the enzyme  cyano  deazaguanine reductase quef from vibrio cholerae which is responsible for the complete reduction of a nitrile cn bond to a primary amine h c  nh  at present this is the only example of a biological pathway that includes reduction of a nitrile bond establishing quef as particularly noteworthy the structure of the quef monomer resembles two connected ferrodoxin like domains that assemble into dimers ligands identified in the crystal structure suggest the likely binding conformation of the native substrates nadph and  cyano  deazaguanine we also report on a series of numerical simulations that have shed light on the mechanism by which this enzyme affects the transfer of four protons and electrons to the  cyano  deazaguanine substrate in particular the simulations suggest that the initial step of the catalytic process is the formation of a covalent adduct with the residue cys   in agreement with previous studies the crystal structure also suggests that two conserved residues his  and asp   play an important role in the delivery of a fourth proton to the substrate
