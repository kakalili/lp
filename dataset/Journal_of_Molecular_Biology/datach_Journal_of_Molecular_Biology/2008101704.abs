structural and functional insights into o methyltransferase from bacillus cereus
the specific substrates mechanisms and structures of the bacterial o methyltransferases omts are not as well characterized as those of other omts recent studies have suggested that bacterial omts catalyze regiospecific reactions that might be used to produce novel compounds in this study we investigated the structural and functional features of an omt from bacillus cereus bcomt  this enzyme catalyzes the o methylation of flavonoids in vitro in an s adenosylmethionine dependent and regiospecific manner we solved the crystal structures of the bcomt apoenzyme and the bcomt  s adenosylhomocysteine sah co complex at resolutions of   and     respectively these structures reveal that the overall structure of dimeric bcomt is similar to that of the canonical omt but that bcomt also has a unique n terminal helical region that is responsible for dimerization the binding of sah causes both local and remote conformational changes in the dimer interface that stabilize the dimerization of bcomt  sah binding also causes ordering of residues glu  to gly   which are disordered in the apoenzyme structure and are known determinants of substrate specificity and thus contributes to formation of the substrate binding pocket our structural analysis indicated a resemblance between the active site of bcomt and that of metal dependent omts using mutational analysis we confirmed that bcomt is a mg  dependent omt these results provide structural and functional insights into the dimerization mechanism and substrate specificity of bcomt
