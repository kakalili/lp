the regions of the sequence most exposed to the solvent within the amyloidogenic state of a protein initiate the aggregation process
formation of misfolded aggregates is an essential part of what proteins can do the process of protein aggregation is central to many human diseases and any aggregating event needs to be prevented within a cell and in protein design in order to aggregate a protein needs to unfold its native state at least partially the conformational state that is prone to aggregate is difficult to study due to its aggregating potential and heterogeneous nature here we use a systematic approach of limited proteolysis in combination with electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry to investigate the regions that are most flexible and solvent exposed within the native ligand bound and amyloidogenic states of muscle acylphosphatase acp  a protein previously shown to form amyloid fibrils in the presence of trifluoroethanol seven proteases with different degrees of specificity have been used for this purpose following exposure to the aggregating conditions a number of sites along the sequence of acp become susceptible to proteolytic digestion the pattern of proteolytic cleavages obtained under these conditions is considerably different from that of the native and ligand bound conformations and includes a portion within the n terminal tail of the protein residues    the region of the sequence     and the position  near the c terminus there is a significant overlap between the regions of the sequence found to be solvent exposed from the present study and those previously identified to be critical in the rate determining steps of aggregation from protein engineering approaches this indicates that a considerable degree of solvent exposure is a feature of the portions of a protein that initiate the process of aggregation
