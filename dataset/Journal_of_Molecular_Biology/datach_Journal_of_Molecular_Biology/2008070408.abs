biochemical identification of base and phosphate contacts between fis and a high affinity dna binding site
fis factor for inversion stimulation is a nucleoid associated protein in escherichia coli and other bacteria that stimulates certain site specific dna recombination events alters dna topology and serves as a global gene regulator dna binding is central to the functions of fis and involves a helix  turn  helix dna binding motif located in the carboxy terminal region specific dna binding is observed at a number of sites exhibiting poorly related sequences such interactions require four critical base pairs positioned         and  nucleotides relative to the central nucleotide of a  bp core binding site to further understand how fis interacts with dna we identified the positions of  dna phosphates based on ethylation interference assays that are required for fis binding these are the   phosphates of the nucleotides at positions                and  relative to the central nucleotide on both dna strands another five phosphates located in the flanking regions from positions   through   can serve as additional contact sites using a combination of biochemical approaches and various mutant fis proteins we probed possible interactions between several key fis residues and dna bases or phosphates within a high affinity binding site we provide evidence in support of interactions between the r  fis residue and a highly conserved guanine at position   and between t  and the critical base pairs at   and   in addition we present evidence in support of interactions between n  and the phosphate   to the base at   between r  and the   phosphate between t  and the  and  phosphates and between k  and the  phosphate this work provides functional evidence for some of the most critical interactions between fis and dna required for a high binding affinity and demonstrates the large contribution made by numerous phosphates to the stability of the fis  dna complex
