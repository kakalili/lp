a    resolution structure of pig muscle  phosphoglycerate kinase with bound mgadp and  phosphoglycerate in open conformation new insight into the role of the nucleotide in domain closure edited by r huber
phosphoglycerate kinase pgk is a typical kinase with two structural domains the domains each bind one of the two substrates  phosphoglycerate  pg and mgatp for the phospho transfer reaction to take place the substrates must be brought closer by a hinge bending domain closure open and closed structures of the enzyme with different relative domain positions have been determined from different species but a comprehensive description of this conformational transition is yet to be attained crystals of pig muscle pgk in complex with mgadp and  phosphoglycerate were grown under the conditions which have previously resulted in crystals of the closed catalytically competent conformation of trypanosoma brucei pgk the x ray structure of the pig muscle ternary complex was determined at    and the model was refined to r     and rfree      contrary to expectation however it represents an essentially open conformation compared to that of t brucei pgk in addition the  phosphate group of adp is mobile in the new structure in contrast to its well defined position in t brucei pgk an extensive comparison of the ternary complexes from these remote species has been carried out in order to establish general differences between the two conformations and is reported here a second pair of the open and closed structures was also compared these analyses have made it possible to define several characteristic changes which accompany the structural transition in addition to those identified previously   the operation of a hinge at  strand l in the inter domain region which greatly affects the relative domain positions   the rearrangement and movement of helix  regulated through the interactions with the nucleotide phosphate and   the existence of another hinge between helix  and the rest of the c terminal part of the chain which allows fine adjustment of the n domain position the main hinge at  strand l acts in concert with the c terminal hinge at helix  described previously simultaneous interactions of the nucleotide phosphate groups with the loop that precedes helix    strand j and the n terminus of helix  are required for propagation of the nucleotide effect towards the  strand l molecular hinge a detailed description of the role of nucleotide binding in the hinge operation is presented
