solution structure of ccp modules     illuminates functional architecture of the complement regulator factor h
the   kda plasma glycoprotein factor h fh  which consists of  complement control protein ccp modules protects self tissue but not foreign organisms from damage by the complement cascade protection is achieved by selective engagement of fh via ccps    ccps    and ccps     with polyanion rich host surfaces that bear covalently attached activation specific fragments of complement component c  the role of intervening ccps    in this process is obscured by lack of structural knowledge we have concatenated new high resolution solution structures of overlapping recombinant ccp pairs     and     to form a three dimensional structure of ccps     and validated it by small angle x ray scattering of the recombinant triple  module fragment superimposing ccp  of this     structure with ccp  from the previously solved ccp     structure yielded an s shaped structure for ccps     in which modules are tilted by      with respect to immediate neighbors but the bend between ccps  and  is counter to the arc traced by ccps     including this four ccp structure in interpretation of scattering data for the longer recombinant segments ccps     and     implied flexible attachment of ccps  and  to ccp  but compact and intimate arrangements of ccp  with ccps    and   taken together with difficulties in recombinant production of module pairs     and     the aberrant structure of ccp  and the variability of     linker sequences among orthologues a structural dependency of ccp  on its neighbors is suggested this has implications for the fh mechanism
