pleiad simc c orf  a novel autolysis regulator for a skeletal muscle specific calpain capn  scaffolds a capn substrate ctbp
capn p  calpain  is a skeletal muscle specific member of the calpain protease family multiple muscle cell functions have been reported for capn  and mutations in this protease cause limb girdle muscular dystrophy type a little is known about the molecular mechanisms that allow capn to be so multifunctional one hypothesis is that the very rapid and exhaustive autolytic activity of capn needs to be suppressed by dynamic molecular interactions for specific periods of time the previously identified interaction between capn and connectin titin a giant molecule in muscle sarcomeres supports this assumption however the regulatory mechanisms of non sarcomere associated capn are unknown here we report that a novel capn binding protein pleiad platform element for inhibition of autolytic degradation originally called simc c orf  sumo interacting motif containing protein  chromosome  open reading frame    suppresses the protease activity of capn  database analyses showed that pleiad homologs like capn homologs are evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates furthermore we found that pleiad also interacts with ctbp  c terminal binding protein   a transcriptional co regulator and ctbp is proteolyzed in cos cells expressing capn  the identified cleavage sites in ctbp suggested that it undergoes functional modification upon its proteolysis by capn  as well as by conventional calpains these results indicate that pleiad can shift its major function from capn suppression to capn substrate recruitment depending on the cellular context taken together our data suggest that pleiad is a novel regulatory scaffold for capn  as reflected in its name
