pattern recognition with a fibril specific antibody fragment reveals the surface variability of natural amyloid fibrils
amyloid immunotherapy has led to the rise of antibodies which target amyloid fibrils or structural precursors of fibrils based on their specific conformational properties recently we reported the biotechnological generation of the b  antibody fragment which provides conformation specific binding to amyloid fibrils b  strongly interacts with fibrils from alzheimer s  amyloid a  peptide while disaggregated a  peptide or a  oligomers are not explicitly recognized b  also enables poly amyloid specific binding and recognizes amyloid fibrils derived from different types of amyloidosis or different polypeptide chains based on our current data however we find that b  does not recognize all tested amyloid fibrils and amyloid tissue deposits it also does not specifically interact with intrinsically unfolded polypeptide chains or globular proteins even if the latter encompass high  sheet content or  solenoid domains by contrast b  binds amyloid fibrils from d amino acid or l amino acid peptides and non proteinaceous biopolymers with highly regular and anionic surface properties such as heparin and dna these data establish that b  binding does not depend on an amyloid specific or protein specific backbone structure instead it involves the recognition of a highly regular and anionic surface pattern this specificity mechanism is conserved in nature and occurs also within a group of natural amyloid receptors from the innate immune system the pattern recognition receptors our data illuminate the structural diversity of naturally occurring amyloid scaffolds and enable the discrimination of distinct fibril populations in vitro and within diseased tissues
