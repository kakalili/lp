crystal structure of human methyl binding domain iv glycosylase bound to abasic dna
the mammalian repair protein mbd  methyl cpg binding domain iv excises thymine from mutagenic g t mispairs generated by deamination of  methylcytosine mc  and downstream base excision repair proteins restore a g c pair mbd is also implicated in active dna demethylation by initiating base excision repair of g t mispairs generated by a deaminase enzyme the question of how mismatch glycosylases attain specificity for excising thymine from g t but not a t pairs remains largely unresolved here we report a crystal structure of the glycosylase domain of human mbd  residues      bound to dna containing an abasic nucleotide paired with guanine providing a glimpse of the enzyme  product complex the mismatched guanine remains intrahelical nestled into a recognition pocket mbd provides selective interactions with the mismatched guanine n h n h  that are not compatible with adenine which likely confer mismatch specificity the structure reveals no interactions that would be expected to provide the mbd glycosylase domain with specificity for acting at cpg sites accordingly we find modest   to   fold reductions in g t activity upon altering the cpg context in contrast   to   fold effects were observed previously for thymine dna glycosylase these findings suggest that specificity of mbd for acting at cpg sites depends largely on its methyl cpg binding domain which binds preferably to g t mispairs in a methylated cpg site mbd glycosylase cannot excise  formylcytosine fc or  carboxylcytosine cac  intermediates in a tet ten eleven translocation initiated dna demethylation pathway our structure suggests that mbd does not provide the electrostatic interactions needed to excise these oxidized forms of mc
