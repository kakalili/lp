predicting subcellular localization of proteins based on their n terminal amino acid sequence
a neural network based tool targetp for large scale subcellular location prediction of newly identified proteins has been developed using n terminal sequence information only it discriminates between proteins destined for the mitochondrion the chloroplast the secretory pathway and  other  localizations with a success rate of   plant or   non plant on redundancy reduced test sets from a targetp analysis of the recently sequenced arabidopsis thaliana chromosomes  and  and the ensembl homo sapiens protein set we estimate that   of all plant proteins are mitochondrial and   chloroplastic and that the abundance of secretory proteins in both arabidopsis and homo is around   targetp also predicts cleavage sites with levels of correctly predicted sites ranging from approximately   to   chloroplastic and mitochondrial presequences to above   secretory signal peptides  targetp is available as a web server at http  www cbs dtu dk services targetp
