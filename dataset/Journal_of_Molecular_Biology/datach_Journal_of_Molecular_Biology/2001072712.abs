type ii protein secretion in gram negative pathogenic bacteria the study of the structure secretion relationships of the cellulase cel  formerly egz from erwinia chrysanthemi edited by i b holland
erwinia chrysanthemi a gram negative plant pathogen secretes the cellulase cel  formerly egz via the type ii secretion pathway referred to as out  cel is composed of two domains a large n terminal catalytic domain   amino acid residues and a small c terminal cellulose binding domain   amino acid residues separated by a linker region a combination of mutagenesis and structural analysis permitted us to investigate the structure secretion relationships with respect to the catalytic domain of cel  the d structure of the catalytic domain was solved by molecular replacement at    resolution cel exhibits the     structural fold and two extra barrel features our previous genetic study based upon trna mediated suppression allowed us to predict positions of importance in the molecule in relation to structure and catalysis remarkably all of the predictions proved to be correct when compared with the present structural information mutations of arg  which is located at the heart of the catalytic domain allowed us to test the consequences of structural modifications on the secretion efficiency the results revealed that secretability imposes remarkably strong constraints upon folding in particular an arg to his mutation yielded a species that folded to a stable conformation close to but distinct from the wild type which however was not secretable we discuss the relationships between folding of a protein in the periplasm en route to the cell exterior and presentation of secretion information we propose that different solutions have been selected for type ii secreted exoproteins in order to meet the constraints imposed by their interaction with their respective secretion machineries we propose that evolutionary pressure has led to the adaptation of different secretion motifs for different type ii exoproteins
