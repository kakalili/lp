the transcription factor spn regulates gene expression via a highly conserved novel structural motif
spn iws plays essential roles in the regulation of gene expression by rna polymerase ii rnapii  and it is highly conserved in organisms ranging from yeast to humans spn physically and or genetically interacts with rnapii tbp tata binding protein  tfiis transcription factor iis  and a number of chromatin remodeling factors swi snf and spt  the central domain of spn  residues      out of   is necessary and sufficient for performing the essential functions of spn in yeast cells here we report the high resolution      crystal structure of the conserved central domain of saccharomyces cerevisiae spn  the central domain is composed of eight  helices in a right handed superhelical arrangement and exhibits structural similarity to domain i of tfiis a unique structural feature of spn is a highly conserved loop which defines one side of a pronounced cavity the loop and the other residues forming the cavity are highly conserved at the amino acid level among all spn family members suggesting that this is a signature motif for spn orthologs the locations and the molecular characterization of temperature sensitive mutations in spn indicate that the cavity is a key attribute of spn that is critical for its regulatory functions during rnapii mediated transcriptional activity
