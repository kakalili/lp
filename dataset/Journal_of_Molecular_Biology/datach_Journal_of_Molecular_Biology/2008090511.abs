exploring the limits of sequence and structure in a variant   crystallin domain of the protein absent in melanoma  aim
crystallins belong to a superfamily of proteins in prokaryotes and eukaryotes that are based on duplications of a characteristic highly conserved greek key motif most members of the superfamily in vertebrates are structural proteins of the eye lens that contain four motifs arranged as two structural domains absent in melanoma  aim  an unusual member of the superfamily whose expression is associated with suppression of malignancy in melanoma contains     crystallin motifs in six domains some of these motifs diverge considerably from the canonical motif sequence aim g  the first   crystallin domain of aim  is the most variant of   crystallin domains currently known in order to understand the limits of sequence variation on the structure we report the crystal structure of aim g at     resolution despite having changes in key residues the domain retains the overall   crystallin fold the domain also contains an unusual extended surface loop that significantly alters the shape of the domain and its charge profile this structure illustrates the resilience of the   fold to considerable sequence changes and its remarkable ability to adapt for novel functions
