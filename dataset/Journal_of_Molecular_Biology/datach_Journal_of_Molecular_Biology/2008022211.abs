peptide mimic of the hiv envelope gp   gp  interface
the human immunodeficiency virus envelope glycoprotein env is composed of surface gp   and transmembrane gp  subunits which are noncovalently associated on the viral surface human immunodeficiency virus env mediates viral entry after undergoing a complex series of conformational changes induced by interaction with cellular cd and a chemokine coreceptor these changes propagate from gp  to gp  via the gp   gp  interface ultimately exposing gp  and allowing it to form the trimer of hairpins structure that provides the driving force for membrane fusion key unresolved questions about the gp   gp  interface include the specific regions of gp  and gp  involved the mechanism by which receptor and coreceptor binding induced conformational changes in gp  are communicated to gp  how trimer of hairpins formation is prevented in the prefusogenic gp   gp  complex and ultimately the structure of the prefusion gp   gp  complex here we develop a biochemical model system that mimics a key portion of the gp   gp  interface in the prefusogenic state we find that a gp  fragment containing the disulfide bond loop and c peptide region binds primarily to the gp  c region and that this interaction is incompatible with trimer of hairpins formation based on these data we propose that in prefusogenic env gp  sequesters the gp  c peptide region away from the n trimer region preventing trimer of hairpins formation until coreceptor binding disrupts this interface this model system is a valuable tool for studying the gp   gp  complex conformational changes induced by cd and coreceptor binding and the mechanism of membrane fusion
