the dna structure responds differently to physiological concentrations of k or na
the influence of monovalent cations on dna conformation and readout is an open question this nmr study of dna with either na or k at physiological concentrations shows that the nature of the cation affects the  p chemical shifts  p and the sequential distances h  i  h  i  h  i  h  i  and h  i  h  i  the  p and distance variations ascertain that the nature of the cation affects the dna overall structure i e both the conformational equilibria between the backbone bi      lt   and bii      gt   states and the helical parameters via their strong mechanical coupling these results reveal that na and k interactions with dna are different and sequence dependent these ions modulate the overall intrinsic properties of dna and possibly its packaging and readout
