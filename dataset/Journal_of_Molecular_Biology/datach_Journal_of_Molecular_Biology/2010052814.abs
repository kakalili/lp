the ribosomal stalk plays a key role in if mediated association of the ribosomal subunits
ribosomal  stalk  protein l  is known to activate translational gtpases ef g and ef tu but not much is known about its role in relation to other two translational g factors if and rf  here we have clarified the role of l  in if mediated initiation of bacterial protein synthesis with fast kinetics measurements we have compared l  depleted  s subunits with the native ones in subunit association gtp hydrolysis pi inorganic phosphate release and if release assays l  depletion from  s subunit slows the subunit association step significantly    fold only when if  gtp is present on the  s preinitiation complex this demonstrates that rapid subunit association depends on a specific interaction between the l  stalk on the  s subunit and if  gtp on the  s subunit l  depletion however did not affect the individual rates of the subsequent steps including gtp hydrolysis on if and pi release thus l  is not a gtpase activating protein gap for if unlike as suggested for ef g and ef tu
