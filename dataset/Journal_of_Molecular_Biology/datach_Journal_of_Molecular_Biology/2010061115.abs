two crystal structures of escherichia coli n acetyl l glutamate kinase demonstrate the cycling between open and closed conformations
n acetyl l glutamate kinase nagk  the paradigm enzyme of the amino acid kinase family catalyzes the second step of arginine biosynthesis although substrate binding and catalysis were clarified by the determination of four crystal structures of the homodimeric escherichia coli enzyme ecnagk  we now determine    resolution crystal structures of ecnagk free from substrates or complexed with the product n acetyl l glutamyl  phosphate nagp and with sulfate which reveal a novel very open nagk conformation to which substrates would associate and from which products would dissociate in this conformation the c domain which hosts most of the nucleotide site rotates        away from the n domain which hosts the acetylglutamate site whereas the empty atp site also exhibits some changes one sulfate is found binding in the region where the  phosphate of atp normally binds suggesting that atp is first anchored to the  phosphate site before perfect binding by induced fit triggering the shift to the closed conformation in contrast the acetylglutamate site is always well formed although its  hairpin lid is found here to be mobile being closed only in the subunit of the ecnagk  nagp complex that binds nagp most strongly lid closure appears to increase the affinity for acetylglutamate nagp and to stabilize the closed enzyme conformation via lid  c domain contacts our finding of nagp bound to the open conformation confirms that this product dissociates from the open enzyme form and allows reconstruction of the active center in the ternary complex with both products delineating the final steps of the reaction which is shown here by site directed mutagenesis to involve centrally the invariant residue gly
