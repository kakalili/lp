organization and evolution of the biological response to singlet oxygen stress
the appearance of atmospheric oxygen from photosynthetic activity led to the evolution of aerobic respiration and responses to the resulting reactive oxygen species in rhodobacter sphaeroides a photosynthetic  proteobacterium a transcriptional response to the reactive oxygen species singlet oxygen  o  is controlled by the group iv  factor  e and the anti  factor chrr in this study we integrated various large datasets to identify genes within the o stress response that contain  e dependent promoters both within r sphaeroides and across the bacterial phylogeny transcript pattern clustering and a  e binding sequence model were used to predict candidate promoters that respond to o stress in r sphaeroides these candidate promoters were experimentally validated to nine r sphaeroides  e dependent promoters that control the transcription of   o activated genes knowledge of the r sphaeroides response to o and its regulator  e  chrr was combined with large scale phylogenetic and sequence analyses to predict the existence of a core set of approximately eight conserved  e dependent genes in  proteobacteria and  proteobacteria the bacteria predicted to contain this conserved response to o include photosynthetic species as well as free living and symbiotic pathogenic nonphotosynthetic species our analysis also predicts that the response to o evolved within the time frame of the accumulation of atmospheric molecular oxygen on this planet
