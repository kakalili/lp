ribosome shut down by  s rrna fragmentation in stationary phase escherichia coli
stationary phase bacterial cells are characterized by vastly reduced metabolic activities yielding a dormant like phenotype several hibernation programs ensure the establishment and maintenance of this resting growth state some of the stationary phase specific modulations affect the ribosome and its translational activity directly in stationary phase escherichia coli we observed the appearance of a  s rrna fragmentation event at the tip of helix  within the small ribosomal subunit  s  stationary phase  s subunits showed markedly reduced activities in protein biosynthesis on the other hand the functional performance of stationary phase large ribosomal subunits  s was indistinguishable from particles isolated from exponentially growing cells introduction of the  s rrna cut in vitro at helix  of exponential phase  s subunits renders them less efficient in protein biosynthesis this indicates that the helix  fragmentation is necessary and sufficient to attenuate translational activities of  s ribosomal subunits these results suggest that stationary phase specific cleavage of  s rrna within the  s subunit is an efficient means to reduce global translation activities under non proliferating growth conditions
