structure and action of a cc bond cleaving    hydrolase involved in nicotine degration
the enzyme   dihydroxy pseudo oxynicotine hydrolase from the nicotine degradation pathway of arthrobacter nicotinovorans was crystallized and the structure was determined by an x ray diffraction analysis at     resolution the enzyme belongs to the    hydrolase family as derived from the chain fold and from the presence of a catalytic triad with its oxyanion hole at the common position this relationship assigns a pocket lined by the catalytic triad as the active center the asymmetric unit contains two c symmetric dimer molecules each adopting a specific conformation one dimer forms a more spacious active center pocket and the other a smaller one suggesting an induced fit all of the currently established c  c bond cleaving    hydrolases are from bacterial meta cleavage pathways for the degradation of aromatic compounds and cover their active center with a  residue lid placed between two adjacent strands of the  sheet in contrast the reported enzyme shields its active center with a   residue n terminal domain which is absent in the meta cleavage hydrolases since neither the substrate nor an analogue could be bound in the crystals the substrate was modeled into the active center using the oxyanion hole as a geometric constraint the model was supported by enzymatic activity data of  point mutants and by the two dimer conformations suggesting an induced fit moreover the model assigned a major role for the large n terminal domain that is specific to the reported enzyme the proposal is consistent with the known data for the meta cleavage hydrolases although it differs in that the reaction does not release alkenes but a hetero aromatic compound in a retro friedel crafts acylation because the hydrolytic water molecule can be assigned to a geometrically suitable site that can be occupied in the presence of the substrate the catalytic triad may not form a covalent acyl enzyme intermediate but merely support a direct hydrolysis
