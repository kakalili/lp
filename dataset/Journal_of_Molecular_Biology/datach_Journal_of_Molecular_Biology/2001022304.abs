circularization changes the folding transition state of the src sh domain edited by c r matthews
native state topology has been implicated as a major determinant of protein folding mechanisms here we test experimentally the robustness of the src sh domain folding transition state to changes in topology by covalently constraining regions of the protein with disulfide crosslinks and then performing kinetic analysis on point mutations in the context of these modified proteins circularization crosslinking the n and c termini of the src sh domain makes the protein topologically symmetric and causes delocalization of structure in the transition state ensemble suggesting a change in the folding mechanism in contrast crosslinking a single structural element the distal  hairpin which is an essential part of the transition state results in a protein that folds  times faster but does not change the distribution of structure in the transition state as the transition states of distantly related sh domains were previously found to be very similar we conclude that the free energy landscape of this protein family contains deep features which are relatively insensitive to sequence variations but can be altered by changes in topology
