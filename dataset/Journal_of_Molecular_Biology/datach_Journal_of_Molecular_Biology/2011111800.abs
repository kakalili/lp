a molecular model of phosphorylation based activation and potentiation of tarantula muscle thick filaments
myosin filaments from many muscles are activated by phosphorylation of their regulatory light chains rlcs  to elucidate the structural mechanism of activation we have studied rlc phosphorylation in tarantula thick filaments whose high resolution structure is known in the relaxed state tarantula rlcs are    non phosphorylated and   mono phosphorylated while on activation mono phosphorylation increases and some rlcs become bi phosphorylated mass spectrometry shows that relaxed state mono phosphorylation occurs on ser  while ca  activated phosphorylation is on ser  both located near the rlc n terminus the sequences around these serines suggest that they are the targets for protein kinase c and myosin light chain kinase mlck  respectively the atomic model of the tarantula filament shows that the two myosin heads   free  and  blocked   are in different environments with only the free head serines readily accessible to kinases thus protein kinase c ser  mono phosphorylation in relaxed filaments would occur only on the free heads structural considerations suggest that these heads are less strongly bound to the filament backbone and may oscillate occasionally between attached and detached states   swaying  heads  these heads would be available for immediate actin interaction upon ca  activation of the thin filaments once mlck becomes activated it phosphorylates free heads on ser  these heads become fully mobile exposing blocked head ser  to mlck this would release the blocked heads allowing their interaction with actin on this model twitch force would be produced by rapid interaction of swaying free heads with activated thin filaments while prolonged exposure to ca  on tetanus would recruit new mlck activated heads resulting in force potentiation
