dsbl and dsbi form a specific dithiol oxidase system for periplasmic arylsulfate sulfotransferase in uropathogenic escherichia coli
disulfide bond formation in the escherichia coli periplasm requires the transfer of electrons from substrate proteins to dsba which is recycled as an oxidant by the membrane protein dsbb the highly virulent uropathogenic e coli strain cft  contains a second homologous pair of proteins dsbl and dsbi which are encoded in a tri cistronic operon together with a periplasmic uropathogen specific arylsulfate sulfotransferase asst  we show that dsbl and dsbi form a functional redox pair and that asst is a substrate of dsbl dsbi in vivo dsbl is the most reactive oxidizing thioredoxin like protein known to date in contrast to dsba however dsbl oxidizes reduced rnasea with a much lower rate and prevents unspecific aggregation of reduced insulin the     resolution crystal structure of reduced dsbl provides insight into the reduced state of thioredoxin like dithiol oxidases at high resolution and reveals an unusual cluster of basic residues stabilizing the thiolate anion of the nucleophilic active site cysteine we propose that the dsbl dsbi pair of uropathogenic e coli was acquired as an additional specific redox couple that guarantees biological activity of asst
