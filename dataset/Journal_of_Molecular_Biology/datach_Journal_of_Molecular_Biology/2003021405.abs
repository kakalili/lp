transactivation of capn by myogenic regulatory factors during myogenesis
the calcium activated cysteine protease m calpain plays a pivotal role during the earlier stages of myogenesis particularly during fusion the enzyme is a heterodimer encoded by the genes capn  for the large subunit and capn  for the small subunit to study the regulation of m calpain the dna sequence upstream of capn was analyzed for promoter elements revealing the existence of five consensus binding sites e box for several myogenic regulatory factors and one binding site for myocyte enhancer factor  mef   transient transfections with reporter gene constructs containing the e box revealed that myod presents a high level of transactivation of reporter constructs containing this region in particular the sequences including the mef  e box in addition over expression of various myogenic factors demonstrated that myod and myogenin with much less efficiency can up regulate capn  both singly and synergistically while myf has no effect on synthesis of the protease experiments with antisense oligonucleotides directed against each myogenic factor revealed that myod plays a specific and pivotal role during capn regulation and cannot be replaced wholly by myogenin and myf
