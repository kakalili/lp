incorporation of the arc p trna binding domain to the catalytic core of metrs can functionally replace the yeast arc p  metrs complex
the catalytic core of methionyl trna synthetase metrs is conserved among all life kingdoms but depending on species origin is often linked to non catalytic domains appended to its n or c terminus these domains usually contribute to protein  protein or protein  trna interactions but their exact biological role and evolutionary purpose is poorly understood yeast metrs contains an n terminal appendix that mediates its interaction with the n terminal part of arc p association with arc p controls the subcellular distribution of metrs furthermore the c terminal part of arc p harbors a conserved trna binding domain trbd required for the arc p dependent stimulation of the catalytic activity of metrs the same trbd is found directly fused to catalytic domains of plant and nematode metrs as well as human tyrosyl trna synthetase to investigate the purpose of arc p  metrs complex formation in yeast we tested the ability of trbd to assist the function of metrs independently of arc p we attached the trbd directly to the c terminus of the metrs catalytic core mc by constructing the chimeric protein mc trbd the effect of mc trbd expression on yeast cell growth as well as its localization and in vitro aminoacylation activity were analyzed and compared to that of mc alone or wild type metrs both in the absence or presence of arc p we show that mc trbd exhibits improved enzymatic activity and can effectively substitute the metrs  arc p binary complex in vivo moreover mc trbd being exclusively cytoplasmic also mimics the metrs  arc p complex in terms of subcellular localization our results suggest that the sole role of the n terminal appended domain of yeast metrs is to mediate the indirect association with the trbd which nevertheless can also function effectively in vivo when directly fused to the catalytic metrs core
