protein import by the mitochondrial presequence translocase in the absence of a membrane potential
the highly organized mitochondrial inner membrane harbors enzymes that produce the bulk of cellular atp via oxidative phosphorylation the majority of inner membrane protein precursors are synthesized in the cytosol precursors with a cleavable presequence are imported by the presequence translocase tim  complex  while other precursors containing internal targeting signals are imported by the carrier translocase tim  complex  both tim  and tim  are activated by the transmembrane electrochemical potential many small inner membrane proteins however do not resemble canonical tim  or tim  substrates and their mechanism of import is unknown we report that subunit e of the f fo atp synthase a small single spanning inner membrane protein that is critical for inner membrane organization is imported by tim  in a process that does not require activation by the membrane potential absence of positively charged residues at the matrix facing amino terminus of subunit e facilitates membrane potential independent import instead engineered positive charges establish a dependence of the import reaction on the electrochemical potential our results have two major implications first they reveal an unprecedented pathway of protein import into the mitochondrial inner membrane which is mediated by tim  second they directly demonstrate the role of the membrane potential in driving the electrophoretic transport of positively charged protein segments across the inner membrane
