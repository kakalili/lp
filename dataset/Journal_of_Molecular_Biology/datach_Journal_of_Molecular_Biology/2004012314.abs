ligand dependent dynamics and intramolecular signaling in a pdz domain
allosteric communication is a fundamental process that proteins use to propagate signals from one site to functionally important distal sites although allostery is usually associated with multimeric proteins and enzymes   long range  communication may be a fundamental property of proteins in some cases communication occurs with minimal structural change pdz post synaptic density  discs large zonula occludens  domains are small protein  protein binding modules that can use multiple surfaces for docking diverse molecules furthermore these domains have long range energetic couplings that link the ligand binding site to distal regions of the structure here we show that allosteric behavior in a representative member of the pdz domain family may be directly detected using side chain methyl dynamics measurements the changes in side chain dynamics parameters in the second pdz domain from the human tyrosine phosphatase e hptp e were determined upon binding a peptide target long range dynamic effects were detected that correspond to previously observed pair wise energetic couplings these results provide one of the first experimental examples for the potential role of ps  ns timescale dynamics in propagating long range signals within a protein and reinforce the idea that dynamic fluctuations in proteins contribute to allosteric signal transduction
