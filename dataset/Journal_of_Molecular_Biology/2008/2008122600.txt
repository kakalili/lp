The Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide is a major component of the amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies suggest that the most toxic forms of Aβ are small, soluble oligomeric aggregates. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a single-chain variable domain (scFv) antibody isolated against oligomeric Aβ using a protocol developed in our laboratory that combines phage display technology and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Starting with a randomized, single framework phage display library, after three rounds of selection against oligomeric Aβ, we identified an scFv that bound oligomeric Aβ specifically, but not monomeric or fibrillar forms. The anti-oligomeric scFv inhibits Aβ aggregation and toxicity, and reduces the toxicity of preformed oligomeric Aβ towards human neuroblastoma cells. When used to probe samples of human brain tissue, the scFv reacted with AD tissue but not a healthy control or Parkinson's disease brain samples. The anti-oligomeric Aβ scFv therefore has potential therapeutic and diagnostic applications in specifically targeting or identifying the toxic morphologies of Aβ in AD brains.
