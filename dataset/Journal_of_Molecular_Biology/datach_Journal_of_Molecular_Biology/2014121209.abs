coupling of downstream rna polymerase  promoter interactions with formation of catalytically competent transcription initiation complex
bacterial rna polymerase rnap makes extensive contacts with duplex dna downstream of the transcription bubble in initiation and elongation complexes we investigated the role of downstream interactions in formation of catalytically competent transcription initiation complex by measuring initiation activity of stable rnap complexes with model promoter dna fragments whose downstream ends extend from  to   relative to the transcription start site at   we found that dna downstream of position  does not play a significant role in transcription initiation when rnap  promoter interactions upstream of the transcription start site are strong and promoter melting region is at rich further shortening of downstream dna dramatically reduces efficiency of transcription initiation the boundary of minimal downstream dna duplex needed for efficient transcription initiation shifted further away from the catalytic center upon increasing the gc content of promoter melting region or in the presence of bacterial stringent response regulators dksa and ppgpp these results indicate that the strength of rnap  downstream dna interactions has to reach a certain threshold to retain the catalytically competent conformation of the initiation complex and that establishment of contacts between rnap and downstream dna can be coupled with promoter melting the data further suggest that rnap interactions with dna immediately downstream of the transcription bubble are particularly important for initiation of transcription we hypothesize that these active center proximal contacts stabilize the dna template strand in the active center cleft and or position the rnap clamp domain to allow rna synthesis
