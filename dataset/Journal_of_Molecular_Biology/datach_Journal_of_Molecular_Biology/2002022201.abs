the reverse transcriptase of the r non ltr retrotransposon continuous synthesis of cdna on non continuous rna templates edited by m gottesman
r is a non long terminal repeat non ltr retrotransposon that inserts into the  s rrna genes of arthropods the element encodes two enzymatic activities an endonuclease that specifically cleaves the  s gene target site and a reverse transcriptase rt that can use the   end of the cleaved dna to prime reverse transcription r rt only utilizes rna templates that contain the   untranslated region of the r element as templates in this target primed reverse transcription tprt reaction here detailed biochemical characterization of the r rt indicates that the enzyme is capable of making multiple consecutive jumps between rna templates the terminal   nucleotide of the  acceptor  rna and the   nucleotide of the  donor  rna are frequently reverse transcribed in these jumps indicating that the acceptor rna does not anneal to the cdna derived from the donor rna template these template jumps occur during tprt as well as in non specific extension reactions in which reverse transcription is primed by an oligonucleotide annealed to the rna template analysis of these rt assays done in the absence of the target dna also revealed that the r rt can initiate reverse transcription near the   end of any rna molecule using the   end of a second rna molecule as primer again there is no requirement for sequence complementarity between the rna used as template and the rna used as primer these properties of the r rt differ substantially from those of retroviral rts but have similarities to the rt of the mauriceville retroplasmid of neurospora crassa we present a model which relates these unusual properties of the r rt to structural differences from retroviral rts as well as correlates these properties to the likely retrotransposition mechanism of r and other non ltr retrotransposons
