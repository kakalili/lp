molecular characterisation of two structurally distinct groups of human homers generated by extensive alternative splicing edited by c r matthews
homer proteins bind specifically to the c termini of the metabotropic glutamate receptor mglur  a and mglur  play a role in their targeting and modulate their synaptic properties we have discovered that extensive alternative splicing generates a family of  homer proteins these fall into two distinct groups of    long  homers which all have a coiled coil domain at their c termini and five  short  homers which lack such a domain all homers contain the n terminal sequence responsible for their binding to mglur  a receptors and can be co localised with the recombinantly expressed mglur  a protein in hek   cells the existence of the long and the short variants of each of the homer  homer  and homer  proteins reflects the fundamental principles of homer functions
