three dimensional structures of pseudomonas aeruginosa pvca and pvcb two proteins involved in the synthesis of  isocyano   dihydroxycoumarin
the pvcabcd operon of pseudomonas aeruginosa encodes four proteins pa   pa   pa   and pa   that form a cluster that is responsible for the synthesis of a cyclized isocyano derivative of tyrosine these proteins which were identified originally as being responsible for a step in the maturation of the chromophore of the peptide siderophore pyoverdine have been identified recently as belonging to a family of proteins that produce small organic isonitriles we report that strains harboring a disruption in the pvca or pvcb genes are able to grow in iron depleted conditions and to produce pyoverdine additionally we have determined the three dimensional crystal structures of pvca and pvcb the structure of pvca demonstrates a novel enzyme architecture that is built upon a rossmann fold we have analyzed the sequence conservation of enzymes within this family and identified six conserved motifs these regions of the protein cluster around a putative active site cavity the structure of the pvcb protein confirms it is a member of the fe   ketoglutarate dependent oxygenase family of enzymes the active site of pvcb is compared to the structures of other family members and suggests that a conformational change to order several loops will accompany the binding of ligands
