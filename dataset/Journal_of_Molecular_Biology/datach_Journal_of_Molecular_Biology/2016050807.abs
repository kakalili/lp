molecular mechanism of pin  tau recognition and catalysis
human peptidyl prolyl isomerase ppiase pin plays key roles in developmental processes cell proliferation and neuronal function extensive phosphorylation of the microtubule binding protein tau has been implicated in neurodegeneration and alzheimer s disease for the past  years these two players have been the focus of an enormous research effort to unravel the biological relevance of their interplay in health and disease resulting in a series of proposed molecular mechanism of how pin catalysis of tau results in biological phenotypes our results presented here refute these mechanisms of pin action using nmr isothermal calorimetry itc  and small angle x ray scattering saxs  we dissect binding and catalysis on multiple phosphorylated tau with particular emphasis toward the alzheimer s associated at  tau epitope containing phosphorylated thr  and ser   we find that phosphorylated p  ser  pro but not pthr  pro is exclusively catalyzed by full length pin and isolated ppiase domain importantly site specific measurements of pin catalysis of cdk cyca phosphorylated full length tau reveal a number of sites that are catalyzed simultaneously with different efficiencies furthermore we show that the turnover efficiency at pser  by pin is independent of both the ww domain and phosphorylation on thr   our mechanistic results on site specific binding and catalysis together with the lack of an increase of dephosphorylation rates by pp a counter a series of previously published models for the role of pin catalysis of tau in alzheimer s disease together our data reemphasize the complicated scenario between binding and catalysis of multiple phosphorylated tau by pin and the need for directly linking biological phenotypes and residue specific turnover in pin substrates
