filling a hole in cytochrome p  bm improves substrate binding and catalytic efficiency
cytochrome p  bm  cyp  a  from bacillus megaterium a fatty acid hydroxylase is a member of a very large superfamily of monooxygenase enzymes the available crystal structures of the enzyme show non productive binding of substrates with their  end distant from the iron in a hydrophobic pocket at one side of the active site we have constructed and characterised mutants in which this pocket is filled by large hydrophobic side chains replacing alanine at position   the mutants having phenylalanine or tryptophan at this position have very much     fold greater affinity for substrate with a greater conversion of the haem iron to the high spin state and similarly increased catalytic efficiency the enzyme as isolated contains bound palmitate reflecting this much higher affinity we have determined the crystal structure of the haem domain of the ala phe mutant with bound palmitate this shows that the substrate is binding differently from the wild type enzyme but still distant from the haem iron detailed analysis of the structure indicates that the tighter binding in the mutant reflects a shift in the conformational equilibrium of the substrate free enzyme towards the conformation seen in the substrate complex rather than differences in the enzyme  substrate interactions on this basis we outline a sequence of events for the initial stages of the catalytic cycle the ala phe and ala trp mutants are also very much more effective catalysts of indole hydroxylation than the wild type enzyme suggesting that they will be valuable starting points for the design of mutants to catalyse synthetically useful hydroxylation reactions
