importance of potential interhelical salt bridges involving interior residues for coiled coil stability and quaternary structure
coiled coils are formed by two or more  helices that align in a parallel or an antiparallel relative orientation polar interactions involving residues at the interior a and d positions are important for determining the quaternary structure of coiled coils in the model heterodimeric coiled coil acid a base a  a buried a  d  asn  asn interaction is sufficient to specify both a dimeric structure and an antiparallel relative helix orientation although the equivalent a  a  interaction is found in parallel coiled coils there is no example of an a  d  asn  asn interaction in structurally characterized naturally occurring antiparallel coiled coils instead interior charged residues form interhelical salt bridges with residues at the adjacent e or g positions using a model coiled coil heterodimer we have explored the role of a potential interhelical interaction between an arg at an interior d position and a glu at the adjacent g  position our results demonstrate that this potentially attractive interhelical coulombic interaction has little or no influence on helix orientation instead we show that burying a single arg residue at an interior position is sufficient to specify a dimeric state at a significantly lower thermodynamic cost than burial of two interacting asn residues
