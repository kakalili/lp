model for substrate interactions in c a peptidase from streptococcus pyogenes a    crystal structure of the active form of scpa
the crystal structure of an active form of scpa has been solved to     resolution scpa is a multidomain cell envelope subtilase from streptococcus pyogenes that cleaves complement component c a the catalytic triad of scpa is geometrically consistent with other subtilases clearly demonstrating that the additional activation mechanism proposed for the streptococcus agalactiae homologue scpb is not required for scpa the scpa structure revealed that access to the catalytic site is restricted by variable regions in the catalytic domain vr  vr  and vr  and by the presence of the inserted protease associated pa domain and the second fibronectin type iii domains fn  modeling of the scpa  c a complex indicates that the substrate binds with carboxyl terminal residues      extended through the active site and core residues     forming exosite type interactions with the fn domain this is reminiscent of the two site mechanism proposed for c a binding to its receptor in the nonprime region of the active site interactions with the substrate backbone are predicted to be more similar to those observed in kexins involving a single  strand in the peptidase however in contrast to kexins there would be diminished emphasis on side chain interactions with little charged character in the s  s and s  s subsites occupied by the side chains of residues in vr and vr  substrate binding is anticipated to be dominated by ionic interactions in two distinct regions of scpa on the prime side of the active site salt bridges are predicted between p   p   and p   residues and residues in the catalytic and pa domains remote to the active site a larger number of ionic interactions between residues in the c a core and the fn domain are observed in the model thus both pa and fn domains are expected to play significant roles in substrate recognition
