crystal structure of the leucine aminopeptidase from pseudomonas putida reveals the molecular basis for its enantioselectivity and broad substrate specificity
the zinc dependent leucine aminopeptidase from pseudomonas putida pplap is an important enzyme for the industrial production of enantiomerically pure amino acids to provide a better understanding of its structure  function relationships the enzyme was studied by x ray crystallography crystal structures of native pplap at ph   and ph   and in complex with the inhibitor bestatin show that the overall folding and hexameric organization of pplap are very similar to those of the closely related di zinc leucine aminopeptidases laps from bovine lens and escherichia coli at ph   the active site contains two metal ions one identified as mn  or zn  site   and the other as zn  site   by using a metal dependent activity assay it was shown that site  in heterologously expressed pplap is occupied mainly by mn  moreover it was shown that mn  has a significant activation effect when bound to site  of pplap at ph   the active site of pplap is highly disordered and the two metal ions are absent most probably due to full protonation of one of the metal interacting residues lys   explaining why pplap is inactive at low ph a structural comparison of the pplap bestatin complex with inhibitor bound complexes of bovine lens lap along with substrate modelling gave clear and new insights into its substrate specificity and high level of enantioselectivity
