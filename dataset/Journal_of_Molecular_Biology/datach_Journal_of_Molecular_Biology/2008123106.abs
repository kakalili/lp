the interaction of hmgb and linker histones occurs through their acidic and basic tails
h and hmgb bind to linker dna in chromatin in the vicinity of the nucleosome dyad they appear to have opposing effects on the nucleosome h stabilising it by  sealing  two turns of dna around the octamer and hmgb destabilising it probably by bending the adjacent dna their presence in chromatin might be mutually exclusive displacement replacement of one by the other as a result of their highly dynamic binding in vivo might in principle involve interactions between them chemical cross linking and gel filtration show that a   linker histone hmgb complex is formed which persists at physiological ionic strength and that complex formation requires the acidic tail of hmgb  nmr spectroscopy shows that the linker histone binds predominantly through its basic c terminal domain to the acidic tail of hmgb  thereby disrupting the interaction of the tail with the dna binding faces of the hmg boxes a potential consequence of this interaction is enhanced dna binding by hmgb  and concomitantly lowered affinity of h for dna in a chromatin context this might facilitate displacement of h by hmgb
