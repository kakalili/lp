the chromatin remodelling protein chd contains a previously unrecognised c terminal helical domain
the packaging of eukaryotic dna into nucleosomes and the organisation of these nucleosomes into chromatin plays a critical role in regulating all dna associated processes chromodomain helicase dna binding protein  chd  is an atp dependent chromatin remodelling protein that is conserved throughout eukaryotes and has an ability to assemble and organise nucleosomes both in vitro and in vivo this activity is involved in the regulation of transcription and is implicated in mammalian development and stem cell biology chd is classically depicted as possessing a pair of tandem chromodomains that directly precede a core catalytic helicase like domain that is then followed by a sant slide dna binding domain here we have identified an additional conserved domain c terminal to the sant slide domain and determined its structure by multidimensional heteronuclear nmr spectroscopy we have termed this domain the chd helical c terminal chct domain as it is comprised of five  helices arranged in a variant helical bundle topology chct has a conserved positively charged surface and is able to bind dna and nucleosomes in addition we have identified another group of proteins the as yet uncharacterised c orf  proteins as also containing a conserved chct domain our data provide new structural insights into the chd enzyme family
