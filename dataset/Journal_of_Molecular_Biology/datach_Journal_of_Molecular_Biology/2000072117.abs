comparative genetic and physiological studies of the map kinase mpk p from kluyveromyces lactis and saccharomyces cerevisiae
map kinases are essential components of signal transduction pathways in yeasts and higher eukaryotes here we report on the isolation of the gene encoding the map kinase klmpk p by complementation of the respective saccharomyces cerevisiae deletion mutant with a genomic library from kluyveromyces lactis sequencing revealed the presence of an open reading frame capable of encoding a protein of   amino acid residues with a deduced molecular mass of    da the deduced protein sequence displayed a high degree of similarity to known map kinases from yeast to man with an overall identity of   to scmpk p one hybrid analysis demonstrated the presence of a cryptic transcriptional activation domain in the c terminal part of the protein deletion of this sequence in scmpk p resulted in a reduced map kinase activity measured by an indirect assay  an increased sensitivity towards caffeine and an increased resistance against calcofluor white complete deletion mutants of klmpk display an osmo remedial phenotype on rich medium but are capable of growth in the absence of osmotic stabilization on synthetic medium as scmpk deletion mutants they are sensitive to cell surface destabilizing agents such as calcofluor white and sds and growth is inhibited in the presence of mm caffeine overexpression of klmpk did not produce a growth defect in s cerevisiae or in k lactis
