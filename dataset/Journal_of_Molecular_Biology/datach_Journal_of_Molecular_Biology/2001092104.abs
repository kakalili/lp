domain swing upon his to ala mutation in nitrite reductase of pseudomonas aeruginosa
the nitrite reductase nir from pseudomonas aeruginosa nir pa is a soluble enzyme catalysing the reduction of nitrite no   to nitric oxide no  the enzyme is a  kda homodimer in which the monomers carry a c heme domain and a d heme domain the structures of the enzyme in both the oxidised and reduced state were solved previously and indicate his  and his  as putative catalytic residues the kinetic characterisation of site directed mutants has shown that the substitution of either one of these two his with ala dramatically reduces the physiologically relevant reactivity towards nitrite leaving the reactivity towards oxygen unaffected the three dimensional structures of p aeruginosa nir mutant h  a and h  a in complex with no have been solved by multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion mad  using the iron anomalous signal and molecular replacement techniques in both refined crystal structures the c heme domain whilst preserving its classical c type cytochrome fold has undergone a   rigid body rotation around an axis parallel with the pseudo  fold axis of the  propeller and passing through residue gln   even though the distance between the fe ions of the c and d heme remains    the edge to edge distance between the two hemes has increased by   furthermore the distal side of the d heme pocket appears to have undergone structural re arrangement and tyr  has moved out of the active site in the h  a no complex the position and orientation of no is significantly different from that of the no bound to the reduced wild type structure our results provide insight into the flexibility of the enzyme and the distinction between nitrite and oxidase reduction mechanisms moreover they demonstrate that the two histidine residues play a crucial role in the physiological activity of nitrite reduction ligand binding and in the structural organisation of nitrite reductase from p aeruginosa
