electrostatic stabilization of a thermophilic cold shock protein edited by c r matthews
the cold shock protein bc csp from the thermophile bacillus caldolyticus differs from its mesophilic homolog bs cspb from bacillus subtilis by   kj mol   in the gibbs free energy of denaturation  gd  the two proteins vary in sequence at  positions but only two of them arg and leu  of bc csp which replace glu and glu  of bs cspb are responsible for the additional stability of bc csp these two positions are near the ends of the protein chain but close to each other in the three dimensional structure the glu arg exchange alone changed the stability by more than  kj mol   here we elucidated the molecular origins of the stability difference between the two proteins by a mutational analysis electrostatic contributions to stability were characterized by measuring the thermodynamic stabilities of many variants as a function of salt concentration double and triple mutant analyses indicate that the stabilization by the glu arg exchange originates from three sources improved hydrophobic interactions of the aliphatic moiety of arg contribute about  kj mol   another  kj mol   is gained from the relief of a pairwise electrostatic repulsion between glu and glu  as in the mesophilic protein and  kj mol   originate from a general electrostatic stabilization by the positive charge of arg  which is not caused by a pairwise interaction mutations of all potential partners for an ion pair within a radius of    around arg had only marginal effects on stability the glu  arg charge reversal thus optimizes ionic interactions at the protein surface by both local and global effects however it cannot convert the coulombic repulsion with another glu residue into a corresponding attraction avoidance of unfavorable coulombic repulsions is probably a much simpler route to thermostability than the creation of stabilizing surface ion pairs which can form only at the expense of conformational entropy
