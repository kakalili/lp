msh separation of function mutations confer defects in the initiation steps of mismatch repair
in eukaryotes the msh msh and msh msh heterodimers initiate mismatch repair mmr by recognizing and binding to dna mismatches the mlh pms heterodimer then interacts with the msh proteins at or near the mismatch site and is thought to act as a mediator to recruit downstream repair proteins here we analyzed five msh mutants that are functional in removing   non homologous tails during double strand break repair but are completely defective in mmr because non homologous tail removal does not require msh  mlh  or pms functions a characterization of the msh separation of function alleles should provide insights into early steps in mmr using the taq muts crystal structure as a model three of the msh mutations msh s  p msh k  e msh g  d were found to map to a domain in muts involved in stabilizing mismatch binding gel mobility shift and dnase i footprinting assays showed that two of these mutations conferred strong defects on msh msh mismatch binding the other two mutations msh s  p and msh r  w mapped to the atpase domain dnase i footprinting atp hydrolysis atp binding and mlh pms interaction assays indicated that the msh s  p mutation caused defects in atp dependent dissociation of msh msh from mismatch dna and in interactions between msh msh and mlh pms  in contrast the msh r  w mutation disrupted msh msh atpase activity but did not strongly affect atp binding or interactions with mlh pms  these results support a model in which mmr can be dissected into discrete steps stable mismatch binding and sensing mlh pms recruitment and recycling of mmr components
