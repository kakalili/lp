actinin is required for the proper assembly of z disk focal adhesion like structures and for efficient locomotion in caenorhabditis elegans
the actin binding protein  actinin is a major component of focal adhesions found in vertebrate cells and of focal adhesion like structures found in the body wall muscle of the nematode caenorhabditis elegans to study its in vivo function in this genetic model system we isolated a strain carrying a deletion of the single c elegans  actinin gene we assessed the cytological organization of other c elegans focal adhesion proteins and the ultrastructure of the mutant the mutant does not have normal dense bodies as observed by electron microscopy however these dense body like structures still contain the focal adhesion proteins integrin talin and vinculin as observed by immunofluorescence microscopy actin is found in normal appearing i bands but with abnormal accumulations near muscle cell membranes although swimming in water appeared grossly normal use of automated methods for tracking the locomotion of individual worms revealed a defect in bending we propose that the reduced motility of  actinin null is due to abnormal dense bodies that are less able to transmit the forces generated by actin myosin interactions
