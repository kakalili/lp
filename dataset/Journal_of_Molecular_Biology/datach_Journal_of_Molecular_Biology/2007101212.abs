p  trp  and phe  are essential for accurate association of hiv  reverse transcriptase with primer template
preventing dimerization of human immunodeficiency virus type  reverse transcriptase hiv  rt constitutes an alternative strategy to abolish virus proliferation we have previously demonstrated that a short peptide derived from the trp cluster of the connection domain disrupts the rt dimer by interacting with trp  and phe  in a cleft located between the fingers and the connection domains of p  both trp  and phe  of p  are essential for the stability of the rt dimer here in order to understand the requirement of trp  and phe  in the p  subunit we have investigated their implication in the formation of rt  primer template p t complexes and in rt processivity by combining pre steady state and steady state kinetics with site directed mutagenesis we demonstrate that both residues are essential for proper binding of the p t and control conformational changes required for rt ordered mechanism trp  and phe  act on p t binding and remodeling of the catalytic site phe g mutation increases the binding  on  rate of both p t and mismatched p t yielding an unfavorable rt  p t for polymerase catalysis unable to pursue mispair extension considering the structure of unliganded rt phe  seems to be involved in the dynamics of p  thumb  finger interactions and in stabilization of the p t in the catalytic site in contrast the p  trp g mutation alters the overall kinetics of p t binding and is essentially involved in stabilizing the rt  p t complex by contacting the   overhang of the template strand mutation of both trp  and phe  alters mispair extension efficiency suggesting that disruption of the tight contacts between the fingers domain and the   overhang of the template strand increases rt fidelity and reduces rt processivity taken together these studies infer that mutations altering the aromatic nature of phe  or trp  that may occur to counteract peptide inhibitors targeting this region will generate an unstable rt exhibiting low polymerase activity and higher fidelity as such our work suggests that the combined application of peptide based rt dimerization inhibitors is likely to be highly efficient
