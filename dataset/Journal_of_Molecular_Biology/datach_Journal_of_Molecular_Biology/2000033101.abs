insights into ligand induced conformational change in cel a from bacillus agaradhaerens revealed by a catalytically active crystal form edited by j m thornton
glycoside hydrolases are ubiquitous enzymes involved in a diverse array of biological processes from the breakdown of biomass through to viral invasion and cellular signalling endoglucanase cel a from bacillus agaradhaerens classified into glycoside hydrolase family  has been studied in a catalytically inactive crystal form at low ph conditions in which native and complex structures revealed the importance of ring distortion during catalysis here we present the structure of cel a in a new crystal form obtained at higher ph values in which the enzyme is active  in crystal   native cellotriosyl enzyme intermediate and  d cellobiose structures were solved at      and    resolution respectively these structures reveal two classes of conformational change those caused by crystal packing and ph with others induced upon substrate binding at ph  a histidine residue his   implicated in substrate binding and catalysis but previously far removed from the substrate binding cleft moves over    into the active site cleft in order to interact with the substrate in the  subsite occupation of the   subsite by substrate induces a loop closure to optimise protein ligand interactions cel a along with the unrelated family  and family  cellulases provides further evidence of substantial conformational change in response to ligand binding for this class of hydrolytic enzyme
