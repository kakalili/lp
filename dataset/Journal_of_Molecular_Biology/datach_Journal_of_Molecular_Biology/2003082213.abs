stop codons and ugg promote efficient binding of the polypeptide release factor erf to the ribosomal a site
to investigate the codon dependence of human erf binding to the mrna  ribosome complex we examined the formation of photocrosslinks between ribosomal components and mrnas bearing a photoactivable  thiouridine probe in the first position of the codon located in the a site addition of erf to the phased mrna  ribosome complexes triggers a codon dependent quenching of crosslink formation the concentration of erf triggering half quenching ranges from low for the three stop codons to intermediate for s ugg and high for other near cognate triplets a theoretical analysis of the photochemical processes occurring in a two state bimolecular model raises a number of stringent conditions fulfilled by the system studied here and shows that in any case sound kd values can be extracted if the ratio mt kd   mt is total concentration of mrna added  considering the kd values obtained for the stop s ugg and sense codons      m     m and    m respectively and our previous finding that only the stop and s ugg codons are able to promote formation of an erf  mrna crosslink implying a role for the niks loop at the tip of the n domain we propose a two step model for erf binding to the a site a codon independent bimolecular step is followed by an isomerisation step observed solely with stop and s ugg codons full recognition of the stop codons by the n domain of erf triggers a rearrangement of bound erf from an open to a closed conformation allowing the universally conserved ggq loop at the tip of the m domain to come into close proximity of the peptidyl transferase center of the ribosome ugg is expected to behave as a cryptic stop codon which owing to imperfect erf codon recognition does not allow full reorientation of the m domain of erf  as far as the physical steps of erf binding to the ribosome are considered they appear to closely mimic the behaviour of the trna ef tu gtp complex but clearly erf is endowed with a greater conformational flexibility than trna
