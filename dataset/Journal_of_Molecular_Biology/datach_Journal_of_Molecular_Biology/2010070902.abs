molecular mechanism of mll phd and rna recognition by the cyp  rrm domain
the nuclear protein cyclophilin   cyp  is a peptidyl prolyl cis  trans isomerase that catalyzes cis  trans isomerization of the peptide bond preceding a proline and promotes folding and conformational changes in folded and unfolded proteins the n terminal rna recognition motif rrm domain of cyp  has been found to associate with the third plant homeodomain phd  finger of the mixed lineage leukemia mll proto oncoprotein and a poly a rna sequence here we report a     resolution crystal structure of the rrm domain of cyp  and describe the molecular mechanism of phd and rna recognition the cyp  rrm domain folds into a five stranded antiparallel  sheet and two  helices the rrm domain but not the catalytic module of cyp  binds strongly to phd  exhibiting a   m affinity as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry nmr chemical shift perturbation csp analysis and dynamics data reveal that the  strands and the      loop of the rrm domain are involved in the interaction with phd  mutations in the phd binding site or deletions in the      loop lead to a significantly reduced affinity or abrogation of the interaction the rna binding pocket of the cyp  rrm domain mapped on the basis of nmr csp and mutagenesis partially overlaps with the phd binding site and rna association is abolished in the presence of mll phd  full length cyp  acts as a negative regulator of mll induced transcription and reduces the expression levels of mll target genes meis and hoxa  together these in vitro and in vivo data provide insight into the multiple functions of cyp  rrm and suggest a cyp  dependent mechanism for regulating the transcriptional activity of mll
