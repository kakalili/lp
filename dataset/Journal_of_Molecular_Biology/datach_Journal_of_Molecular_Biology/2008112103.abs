architecture and flexibility of the yeast ndc  kinetochore complex
kinetochores mediate microtubule  chromosome attachment and ensure accurate segregation of sister chromatids the highly conserved ndc  kinetochore complex makes direct contacts with the microtubule and is essential for spindle checkpoint signaling it contains a long coiled coil region with globular domains at each end involved in kinetochore localization and microtubule binding respectively we have directly visualized the architecture of the yeast ndc  complex and found a dramatic kink within the    coiled coil rod located about     from the larger globular head comparison of our electron microscopy images to the structure of the human ndc  complex allowed us to position the kink proximal to the microtubule binding end and to define the conformational range of the complex the position of the kink coincides with a coiled coil breaking region conserved across eukaryotes we hypothesize that the kink in ndc  is essential for correct kinetochore geometry and could be part of a tension sensing mechanism at the kinetochore
