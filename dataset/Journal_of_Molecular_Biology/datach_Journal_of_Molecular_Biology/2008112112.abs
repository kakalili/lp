kap p binding induces the switch loops of rangdp to adopt the gtp bound conformation implications for nuclear import complex assembly dynamics
the asymmetric distribution of the nucleotide bound state of ran across the nuclear envelope is crucial for determining the directionality of nuclear transport in the nucleus ran is primarily in the guanosine   triphosphate gtp bound state whereas in the cytoplasm ran is primarily guanosine   diphosphate gdp bound conformational changes within the ran switch i and switch ii loops are thought to modulate its affinity for importin   here we show that rangdp and importin  form a stable complex with a micromolar dissociation constant this complex can be dissociated by importin  binding partners such as importin   surprisingly the crystal structure of the kap p  rangdp complex shows that kap p induces the switch i and ii regions of rangdp to adopt a conformation that resembles that of the gtp bound form the structure of the complex provides insights into the structural basis for the gradation of affinities regulating nuclear protein transport
