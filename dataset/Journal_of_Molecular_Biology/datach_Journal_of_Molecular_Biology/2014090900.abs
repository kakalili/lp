sorting nexin  binds multiple  integrin cytoplasmic domains and regulates   integrin surface levels and stability
trafficking of    integrin to lysosomes and its subsequent degradation is influenced by ligand occupancy and the binding of snx  via its protein   ezrin radixin moesin ferm domain to the membrane distal npxy motif in the cytoplasmic domain of   integrin in early endosomes two other sorting nexin snx family members namely snx  and snx  share with snx  next to their obligate phox domain a ferm domain which may enable them to bind  integrin tails here we report that in addition to snx  snx  but not snx  binds several  integrin tails in early endosomes in a pi  phosphatidylinositide  kinase dependent manner similarly like snx  binding of snx  with   integrin tails in early endosomes occurs between the ferm domain and the membrane distal npxy motif in the   integrin cytoplasmic domain furthermore expression of snx  rescues   integrin surface levels and stability in snx  depleted cells in contrast to snx  expression of snx  is restricted and found highly expressed in bladder and melanoma tissue altogether these results demonstrate that snx  is an endosomal regulator of  integrins with a restricted expression pattern
