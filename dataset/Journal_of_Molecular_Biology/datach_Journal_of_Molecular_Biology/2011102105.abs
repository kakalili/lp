escrt machinery potentiates hiv  utilization of the pi   p plc ip r ca  signaling cascade
human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  release efficiency is directed by late l domain motifs in the viral structural precursor polyprotein gag which serve as links to the escrt endosomal sorting complex required for transport machinery linkage is normally through binding of tsg   an escrt  component to the p tap motif in the p region of gag in its absence budding is directed by binding of alix an escrt adaptor protein to the ly pxnl motif in gag we recently showed that budding requires activation of the inositol    triphosphate receptor ip r  a protein that  gates  ca  release from intracellular stores triggers ca  cell influx and thereby functions as a major regulator of ca  signaling in the present study we determined whether the l domain links gag to ca  signaling machinery depletion of ip r and inactivation of phospholipase c plc inhibited budding whether or not tsg  was bound to gag plc hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol    bisphosphate generates inositol     triphosphate the ligand that activates ip r however with tsg  bound gag release was independent of gq mediated activation of plc and budding was readily enhanced by pharmacological stimulation of plc moreover ip r was redistributed to the cell periphery and cytosolic ca  was elevated events indicative of induction of ca  signaling the results suggest that l domain function escrt machinery and ca  signaling are linked events in gag release
