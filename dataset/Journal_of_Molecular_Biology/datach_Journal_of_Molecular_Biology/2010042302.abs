structural basis of the regulation of the cbpa co chaperone by its specific modulator cbpm
cbpa one of the escherichia coli dnaj homologues acts as a co chaperone in the dnak chaperone system despite its extensive similarity in domain structure and function to dnaj cbpa has a unique and specific regulatory mechanism mediated through the small protein cbpm both cbpa and cbpm are highly conserved in bacteria earlier studies showed that cbpm interacts with the n terminal j domain of cbpa inhibiting its co chaperone activity but the structural basis of this interaction is not known here we have combined nmr spectroscopy site directed mutagenesis and surface plasmon resonance to characterize the cbpa cbpm interaction at the molecular level we have determined the solution structure of the cbpa j domain and mapped the residues that are perturbed upon cbpm binding the nmr data defined a broad region on helices   and   as involved in the interactions site directed mutagenesis has been used to further delineate the cbpa j domain cbpm interface we show that the binding sites of cbpm and dnak on cbpa j domain overlap which suggests a competition between dnak and cbpm for binding to cbpa as a mechanism for cbpa regulation this study also provides the explanation for the specificity of cbpm for cbpa versus dnaj by identifying the key residues for differential binding
