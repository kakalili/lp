anastellin an fn fragment with fibronectin polymerization activity resembles amyloid fibril precursors
anastellin is a carboxy terminal fragment of the first fn domain from human fibronectin it is capable of polymerizing fibronectin in vitro and it displays anti tumor anti metastatic and anti angiogenic properties in vivo we have determined the structure of anastellin using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and identified residues critical for its activity anastellin exhibits dynamic fluctuations and conformational exchange in solution its overall topology is very similar to the corresponding region of full length fn domains however its hydrophobic core becomes solvent accessible and some of its  strands lose their protection against hydrogen bonding to  strands from other molecules these features seem to be relevant for the fibronectin polymerization activity of anastellin and resemble the characteristics of amyloid fibril precursors we suggest that this analogy is not random and may reflect similarities between fibronectin and amyloid fibril formation
