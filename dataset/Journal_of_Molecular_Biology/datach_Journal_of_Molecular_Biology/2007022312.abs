nmr analysis of the conformational properties of the trapped on pathway folding intermediate of the bacterial immunity protein im
previous work shows that the transiently populated on pathway intermediate in im folding contains three of the four native  helices docked around a core stabilised by native and non native interactions to determine the structure and dynamic properties of this species in more detail we have used protein engineering to trap the intermediate at equilibrium and analysed the resulting proteins using nmr spectroscopy and small angle x ray scattering four variants were created in l ai a two hydrophobic residues within helix iii are truncated preventing helix iii from docking stably onto the developing hydrophobic core in two other variants the six residues encompassing the native helix iii were replaced with three h g  or six h g  glycine residues in the fourth variant yy two native tyrosine residues tyr  and tyr  were re introduced into h g to examine their role in determining the properties of the intermediate ensemble all four variants show variable peak intensities and broad peak widths consistent with these proteins being conformationally dynamic chemical shift analyses demonstrated that l ai a and yy contain native like secondary structure in helices i and iv while helix ii is partly formed and helix iii is absent lack of noes and rapid nh exchange for l ai a combined with detailed analysis of the backbone dynamics indicated that the hydrophobic core of this variant is not uniquely structured but fluctuates on the nmr timescale the results demonstrate that though much of the native like secondary structure of im is present in the variants their hydrophobic cores remain relatively fluid the comparison of h g h g and l ai a yy suggests that tyr  and or tyr  interact with the three helix core leading other residues in this region of the protein to dock with the core as folding progresses in this respect the three helix bundle acts as a template for formation of helix iii and the creation of the native fold
