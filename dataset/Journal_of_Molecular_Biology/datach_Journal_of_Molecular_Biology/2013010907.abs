the regulatory domain stabilizes the p  tetramer by intersubunit contacts with the dna binding domain
the tumor suppressor protein p  is often referred to as the guardian of the genome in the past controversial findings have been presented for the role of the c terminal regulatory domain rd of p  as both a negative regulator and a positive regulator of p  activity however the underlying mechanism remained enigmatic to understand the function of the rd and of a dominant phosphorylation site within the rd we analyzed p  variants in vivo and in vitro our experiments revealed surprisingly that the p  rd of one subunit interacts with the dna binding domain of an adjacent subunit in the tetramer this leads to the formation of intersubunit contacts that stabilize the tetrameric state of p  and enhance its transcriptional activity in a cooperative manner these effects are further modulated by phosphorylation of a conserved serine within the rd
