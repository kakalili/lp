crystal structure of the galnac gal specific agglutinin from the phytopathogenic ascomycete sclerotinia sclerotiorum reveals novel adaptation of a  trefoil domain
a lectin from the phytopathogenic ascomycete sclerotinia sclerotiorum that shares only weak sequence similarity with characterized fungal lectins has recently been identified s sclerotiorum agglutinin ssa is a homodimeric protein consisting of two identical subunits of    kda and displays specificity primarily towards gal galnac glycan array screening indicates that ssa readily interacts with gal galnac bearing glycan chains the crystal structures of ssa in the ligand free form and in complex with the gal    galnac t antigen disaccharide have been determined at   and     resolution respectively ssa adopts a  trefoil domain as previously identified for other carbohydrate binding proteins of the ricin b like lectin superfamily and accommodates terminal non reducing galactosyl and n acetylgalactosaminyl glycans unlike other structurally related lectins ssa contains a single carbohydrate binding site at site   ssa reveals a novel dimeric assembly markedly dissimilar to those described earlier for ricin type lectins the present structure exemplifies the adaptability of the  trefoil domain in the evolution of fungal lectins
