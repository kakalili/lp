biogenesis of the dicarboxylate carrier dic  translocation across the mitochondrial outer membrane and subsequent release from the tom channel are membrane potential independent edited by m yaniv
the mitochondrial inner membrane of saccharomyces cerevisiae contains a group of homologous carrier proteins that mediate the exchange of several metabolites the members of this protein family are synthesized in the cytosol and reach their final topology after translocation across the mitochondrial outer membrane using the adp atp carrier aac as a model protein previous studies have established four distinct steps of the import pathway stages i iv  in the absence of the mitochondrial membrane potential     the aac accumulates at the inner surface of the outer membrane stage iiia and remains bound to the outer membrane import channel only in the presence of the membrane potential can a complex of small tim proteins mediate transfer of the aac to the inner membrane in this study we characterized the import pathway of the dicarboxylate carrier dic  different from the aac the dic showed complete   independent translocation across the outer membrane release from the import pore and mainly accumulated in a soluble state in the intermembrane space thus defining a new translocation intermediate stage iii   the dic should be a suitable model protein for the characterization of   independent functions of the intermembrane space tim proteins
