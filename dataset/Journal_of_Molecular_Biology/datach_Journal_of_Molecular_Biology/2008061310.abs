extreme temperature tolerance of a hyperthermophilic protein coupled to residual structure in the unfolded state
understanding the mechanisms that dictate protein stability is of large relevance for instance to enable design of temperature tolerant enzymes with high enzymatic activity over a broad temperature interval in an effort to identify such mechanisms we have performed a detailed comparative study of the folding thermodynamics and kinetics of the ribosomal protein s  isolated from a mesophilic s meso and hyperthermophilic s thermo bacterium by using a variety of biophysical methods as basis for the study the     x ray structure of s thermo was solved using single wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing thermal unfolding experiments yielded midpoints of  and    c with associated changes in heat capacity upon unfolding  cp  of   and   kj mol   k   respectively a strong linear correlation between  cp and melting temperature tm was observed for the wild type proteins and mutated variants suggesting that these variables are intimately connected stopped flow fluorescence spectroscopy shows that s meso folds through an apparent two state model whereas s thermo folds through a more complex mechanism with a marked curvature in the refolding limb indicating the presence of a folding intermediate time resolved energy transfer between trp and n   difluoro   dimethyl  bora a a diaza s indacene  yl methyl iodoacetamide of proteins mutated at selected positions shows that the denatured state ensemble of s thermo is more compact relative to s meso taken together our results suggest the presence of residual structure in the denatured state ensemble of s thermo that appears to account for the large difference in quantified  cp values and in turn parts of the observed extreme thermal stability of s thermo these observations may be of general importance in the design of robust enzymes that are highly active over a wide temperature span
