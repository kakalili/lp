the structural basis for exopolygalacturonase activity in a family  glycoside hydrolase
family  glycoside hydrolases polygalacturonases are found in organisms across the plant fungal and bacterial kingdoms where they are central to diverse biological functions such as fruit ripening biomass recycling and plant pathogenesis the structures of several polygalacturonases have been reported however all of these enzymes utilize an endo mode of digestion which generates a spectrum of oligosaccharide products with varying degrees of polymerization the structure of a complementary exo acting polygalacturonase and an accompanying explanation of the molecular determinants for its specialized activity have been noticeably lacking we present the structure of an exopolygalacturonase from yersinia enterocolitica yegh  in a native form solved to     resolution and a digalacturonic acid product complex solved to     resolution  the activity of yegh  is due to inserted stretches of amino acid residues that transform the active site from the open ended channel observed in the endopolygalacturonases to a closed pocket that restricts the enzyme to the exclusive attack of the non reducing end of oligogalacturonide substrates in addition yegh  possesses a fused fn domain with unknown function the first such structure described in pectin active enzymes
