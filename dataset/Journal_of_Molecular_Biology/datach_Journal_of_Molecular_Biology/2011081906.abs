structural basis for the function of tim  in the mitochondrial presequence translocase
many mitochondrial proteins are synthesized as preproteins carrying amino terminal presequences in the cytosol the preproteins are imported by the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane and the presequence translocase of the inner membrane tim  and tim  transfer preproteins through the intermembrane space to the inner membrane we report the crystal structure of the intermembrane space domain of yeast tim  to     resolution a protruding  hairpin of tim  is crucial for interaction with tim  providing a molecular basis for the cooperation of tim  and tim  in preprotein translocation to the protein conducting channel of the mitochondrial inner membrane
