We have detected by nucleotide analog interference mapping (NAIM) AMPαS and IMPαS modifications in Bacillus subtilis RNase P RNA that interfere with binding of the homologous protein subunit. Interference as well as some enhancement effects were clustered in two main areas, in P10.1a/L10.1 and P12 of the specificity domain (cluster 1, domain I) and in P2, P3, P15.1, J18/2 and J19/4 of the catalytic domain (cluster 2a, domain II). Minor interferences in P1 and P19 and a strong and weak enhancement effect in P19 represent a third area located in domain II (cluster 2b). Our results suggest that P3, P2-J18/2 and J19/4 are key elements for anchoring of the protein to the catalytic domain close to the scissile phosphodiester in enzyme-substrate complexes. Sites of interference or enhancement in clusters 1 and 2a are located at distances between 65 and 130 Å from each other in the current 3D model of a full-length RNase P RNA-substrate complex. Taking into account that the RNase P protein monomer can bridge a maximum distance of about 40 Å, simultaneous direct contacts to the two aforementioned potential RNA-binding areas would be incompatible with our current understanding of bacterial RNase P RNA architecture. Our findings suggest that the current 3D model has to be rearranged in order to reduce the distance between clusters 1 and 2a. Alternatively, based on the recent finding that B. subtilis RNase P forms a tetramer consisting of two protein and two RNA subunits, cluster 1 may reflect one protein contact site in domain I, and cluster 2a a separate one in domain II.
