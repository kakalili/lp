single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays reveal heterogeneous folding ensembles in a simple rna stem  loop
we have examined the folding ensembles present in solution for a series of rna oligonucleotides that encompass the replicase translational operator stem  loop of the rna bacteriophage ms  single molecule sm fluorescence assays suggest that these rnas exist in solution as ensembles of differentially base paired base stacked states at equilibrium there are two distinct ensembles for the wild type sequence implying the existence of a significant free energy barrier between  folded  and  unfolded  ensembles experiments with sequence variants are consistent with an unfolding mechanism in which interruptions to base paired duplexes in this example by the single stranded loop and a single base bulge in the base paired stem as well as the free ends act as nucleation points for unfolding the switch between folded and unfolded ensembles is consistent with a transition that occurs when all base pairing and or base stacking interactions that would orientate the legs of the rna stem are broken strikingly a u to c replacement of a residue in the loop which creates a high affinity form of the operator for coat protein binding results in dramatically different un folding behaviour revealing distinct subpopulations that are either stabilised or destabilised with respect to the wild type sequence this result suggests additional reasons for selection against the c variant stem  loop in vivo and provides an explanation for the increased affinity
