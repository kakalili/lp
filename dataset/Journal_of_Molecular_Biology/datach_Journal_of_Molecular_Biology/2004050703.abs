a mutant kcsa k channel with altered conduction properties and selectivity filter ion distribution
the selectivity filter of k channels is comprised of a linear queue of four equal spaced ion binding sites spanning a distance of    each site is formed of eight oxygen atoms from the protein the first three sites numbered    from the extracellular side are made of exclusively main chain carbonyl oxygen atoms the fourth site closest to the intracellular side is made of four main chain carbonyl oxygen atoms and four threonine side chain hydroxyl oxygen atoms here we characterize the effects of mutating the threonine to cysteine on the distribution of ions in the selectivity filter and on the conduction of ions through the filter the mutation influences the occupancy of k at sites  and  and it reduces the maximum rate of conduction in the limit of high k concentration the mutation does not affect the conduction of rb  these results can be understood in the context of a conduction mechanism in which a pair of k ions switch between energetically balanced   and   configurations
