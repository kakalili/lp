understanding the sequence specificity of trna binding to elongation factor tu using trna mutagenesis
measuring the binding affinities of  single base pair mutants in the acceptor and t c stems of saccharomyces cerevisiae trnaphe to thermus thermophilus elongation factor tu ef tu revealed that much of the specificity for trna occurs at the          and     base pairs introducing the same mutations at the three positions into escherichia coli trnacagleu resulted in similar changes in binding affinity swapping the three pairs from several e coli trnas into yeast trnaphe resulted in chimeras with ef tu binding affinities similar to those for the donor trna finally analysis of double and triple base pair mutants of trnaphe showed that the thermodynamic contributions at the three sites are additive permitting reasonably accurate prediction of the ef tu binding affinity for all e coli trnas thus it appears that the thermodynamic contributions of three base pairs in the t c stem primarily account for trna binding specificity to ef tu
