origins of pressure induced protein transitions
the molecular mechanisms underlying pressure induced protein denaturation can be analyzed based on the pressure dependent differences in the apparent volume occupied by amino acids inside the protein and when they are exposed to water in an unfolded conformation we present here an analysis for the peptide group and the  naturally occurring amino acid side chains based on volumetric parameters for the amino acids in the interior of the native state the micelle like interior of the pressure induced denatured state and the unfolded conformation modeled by n acetyl amino acid amides the transfer of peptide groups from the protein interior to water becomes increasingly favorable as pressure increases thus solvation of peptide groups represents a major driving force in pressure induced protein denaturation polar side chains do not appear to exhibit significant pressure dependent changes in their preference for the protein interior or solvent the transfer of nonpolar side chains from the protein interior to water becomes more unfavorable as pressure increases we conclude that a sizeable population of nonpolar side chains remains buried inside a solvent inaccessible core of the pressure induced denatured state at elevated pressures this core may become packed almost as tightly as the interior of the native state the presence and partial disappearance of large intraglobular voids is another driving force facilitating pressure induced denaturation of individual proteins our data also have implications for the kinetics of protein folding and shed light on the nature of the folding transition state ensemble
