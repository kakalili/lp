solution structure of gfi  zinc domain bound to consensus dna
gfi  is a crucial transcriptional repressor for the precise regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation in hematopoiesis recently this protein has also been demonstrated to be capable of restricting the proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells a process that appears to be vital for the long term competency of hematopoietic stem cells these two seemingly opposite outcomes of regulation are likely to arise from its interactions with a variety of cellular partners such interactions can directly affect the genes that gfi  recognizes through its dna binding zinc finger domain in this work we report the determination of the solution structure of gfi  zinc fingers    in complex with a  mer consensus dna using multidimensional nmr method unlike a proposed minor groove binding model based on methylation interference experiments our structure clearly shows that gfi  zinc fingers    bind into the major groove of the target dna reminiscent of canonical c h zinc finger domains the fourth and fifth zinc fingers recognize the aatc core sequence by forming base specific hydrogen bonds between the side chains of asn   gln   and asp  and the bases of the invariant adenines and cytosine overall the current work provides valuable insight into the structural determinants for dna binding specificity in particular for the tca triplet that has not been observed in any other structures of zinc finger  dna complexes as well as molecular rationales for a naturally occurring mutation that causes acute myeloid leukemia
