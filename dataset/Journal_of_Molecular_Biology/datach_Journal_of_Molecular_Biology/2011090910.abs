invivo and in vitro analyses of toxic mutants of het s ftir antiparallel signature correlates with amyloid toxicity
the folding and interactions of amyloid proteins are at the heart of the debate as to how these proteins may or may not become toxic to their host although little is known about this issue the structure seems to be clearly involved with effects on molecular events to understand how an amyloid may be toxic we previously generated a yeast toxic amyloid mutant  from the nontoxic het s      prion domain of podospora anserina here we performed a comprehensive structure  toxicity study by mutating individually each of the  mutations found in mutant  the study of the library of new mutants generated allowed us to establish a clear link between fourier transform infrared antiparallel signature and amyloid toxicity all of the mutants that form parallel  sheets are not toxic double mutations may be sufficient to shift a parallel structure to antiparallel amyloids which are toxic to yeast our findings also suggest that the toxicity of antiparallel structured mutants may be linked to interaction with membranes
