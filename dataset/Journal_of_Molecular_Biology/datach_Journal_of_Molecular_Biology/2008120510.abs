a new member of the alkaline phosphatase superfamily with a formylglycine nucleophile structural and kinetic characterisation of a phosphonate monoester hydrolase phosphodiesterase from rhizobium leguminosarum
the alkaline phosphatase superfamily comprises a large number of hydrolytic metalloenzymes such as phosphatases and sulfatases we have characterised a new member of this superfamily a phosphonate monoester hydrolase phosphodiesterase from rhizobium leguminosarum rlpmh both structurally and kinetically the     crystal structure shows structural homology to arylsulfatases with conservation of the core    fold the mononuclear active site and most of the active site residues sulfatases use a unique formylglycine nucleophile formed by posttranslational modification of a cysteine serine embedded in a signature sequence c s xpxr we provide mass spectrometric and mutational evidence that rlpmh is the first non sulfatase enzyme shown to use a formylglycine as the catalytic nucleophile rlpmh hydrolyses phosphonate monoesters and phosphate diesters with similar efficiency burst kinetics suggest that substrate hydrolysis proceeds via a double displacement mechanism kinetic characterisation of active site mutations establishes the catalytic contributions of individual residues a mechanism for substrate hydrolysis is proposed on the basis of the kinetic data and structural comparisons with e coli alkaline phosphatase and pseudomonas aeruginosa arylsulfatase rlpmh represents a further example of conservation of the overall structure and mechanism within the alkaline phosphatase superfamily
