dynamic elements at both cytoplasmically and extracellularly facing sides of the uapa transporter selectively control the accessibility of substrates to their translocation pathway
in the uapa uric acid  xanthine permease of aspergillus nidulans subtle interactions between key residues of the putative substrate binding pocket located in the tms  tms loop where tms is transmembrane segment  and a specificity filter implicating residues in tms  and the tms  tms loop are critical for function and specificity by using a strain lacking all transporters involved in adenine uptake  azga  fcyb  uapc and carrying a mutation that partially inactivates the uapa specificity filter f  s  we obtained  mutants capable of uapa mediated growth on adenine seventy two percent of mutants concern replacements of a single residue r   in the putative cytoplasmic loop tms   tms  five missense mutations are located in tms  in tms  or in loops tms  tms and tms  tms  mutations in the latter loops concern residues previously shown to enlarge uapa specificity q  l or to be part of a motif involved in substrate binding f  y  in all mutants the ability of uapa to transport its physiological substrates remains intact whereas the increased capacity for transport of adenine and other purines seems to be due to the elimination of elements that hinder the translocation of non physiological substrates through uapa rather than to an increase in relevant binding affinities the additive effects of most novel mutations with f  s and allele specific interactions of mutation r  g tms   tms  loop with q  l tms  tms loop or t  m tms  establish specific interdomain synergy as a critical determinant for substrate selection our results strongly suggest that distinct domains at both sides of uapa act as selective dynamic gates controlling substrate access to their translocation pathway
