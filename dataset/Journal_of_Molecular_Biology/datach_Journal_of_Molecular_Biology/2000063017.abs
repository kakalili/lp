a compact monomeric intermediate identified by nmr in the denaturation of dimeric triose phosphate isomerase edited by c r matthes
the denaturation of triose phosphate isomerase tim from saccharomyces cerevisiae by guanidine hydrochlorids at ph   has been monitored by nmr spectroscopy in conjunction with optical spectroscopy in the absence of denaturant the hydrodynamic radius of         and the substantial chemical shift dispersion evident in the nmr spectrum are consistent with the highly structured dimeric native state of the protein on the addition of   m guanidine hydrochloride the effective hydrodynamic radius increases to         consistent with that anticipated for the polypeptide chain in a highly unstructured random coil state in   m guanidine hydrochloride however the effective hydrodynamic radius is         a value substantially decreased relative to that of the native dimeric state but very close to that anticipated for a monomeric species with native like compaction      the lack of chemical shift dispersion indicates however that few tertiary interactions persist within this species far uv cd and intrinsic fluorescence measurements show that this compact intermediate retains significant secondary structure and that on average the fluorophores are partially excluded from solvent such a species could be important in the formation of dimeric tim from its unfolded state
