structures of two kinetic intermediates reveal species specificity of penicillin binding proteins
penicillin binding proteins pbps  the target enzymes of  lactam antibiotics such as penicillins and cephalosporins catalyze the final peptidoglycan cross linking step of bacterial cell wall biosynthesis   lactams inhibit this reaction because they mimic the d alanyl d alanine peptide precursors of cell wall structure prior crystallographic studies have described the site of  lactam binding and inhibition but they have failed to show the binding of d ala d ala substrates we present here the first high resolution crystallographic structures of a pbp d ala d ala peptidase of streptomyces sp strain r  non covalently complexed with a highly specific fragment glycyl l  amino  pimelyl d ala d ala of the cell wall precursor in both enzyme  substrate and enzyme  product forms the    resolution structure of the enzyme  substrate henri  michaelis complex was achieved by using inactivated enzyme which was formed by cross linking two catalytically important residues tyr  and lys  the second structure at    resolution of the uncross linked active form of the dd peptidase shows the non covalent binding of the two products of the carboxypeptidase reaction the well defined substrate binding site in the two crystallographic structures shows a subsite that is complementary to a portion of the natural cell wall substrate that varies among bacterial species in addition the structures show the displacement of  water molecules from the active site the location of residues responsible for substrate binding and clearly demonstrate the necessity of lys  and or tyr  for the acylation step with the donor peptide comparison of the complexed structures described here with the structures of other known pbps suggests the design of species targeted antibiotics as a counter strategy towards  lactamase elicited bacterial resistance
