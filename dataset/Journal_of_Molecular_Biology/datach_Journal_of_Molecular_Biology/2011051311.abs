zinc binding to the tyr  and his  allotypes of complement factor h possible implications for age related macular degeneration
the tyr  his polymorphism of complement factor h fh with  short complement regulator scr domains is associated with age related macular degeneration amd  how fh contributes to disease pathology is not clear both fh and high concentrations of zinc are found in drusen deposits the key feature of amd heterozygous fh is inhibited by zinc which causes fh to aggregate here zinc binding to homozygous fh was studied by analytical ultracentrifugation large amounts of oligomers were observed with both the native tyr  and the amd risk his  homozygous allotypes of fh and both the recombinant scr   allotypes with tyr his   x ray scattering also showed that both fh and scr   allotypes strongly aggregated at gt    m zinc the scr   and scr    fragments were less likely to bind zinc these observations were supported by bioinformatics predictions starting from known zinc binding sites in crystal structures we predicted   putative partial surface zinc binding sites in fh most of which were in scr  metal site prediction web servers also suggested that scr  and other domains bind zinc predicted scr   dimer structures showed that zinc binding sites could be formed at the protein  protein interface that would lead to daisy chained oligomers it was concluded that zinc binds weakly to fh at multiple surface locations most probably within the functionally important scr   domains and this explains why zinc inhibits fh activity given the high pathophysiological levels of bioavailable zinc present in subretinal deposits we discuss how zinc binding to fh may contribute to deposit formation and inflammation associated with amd
