H1 histones are progressively phosphorylated during the cell cycle. The number of phosphorylated sites is zero to three in late S phase and increases to five or six in late G2 phase and M phase. It is assumed that this phosphorylation modulates chromatin condensation and decondensation, but its specific role remains unclear. Recently, it was shown that the somatic H1 histone subtype H1.5 becomes pentaphosphorylated during mitosis, with phosphorylated threonine 10 being the last site to be phosphorylated. We have generated an antiserum specific for human H1.5 phosphorylated at threonine 10. Immunofluorescence labeling of HeLa cells with this antiserum revealed that the phosphorylation at this site appears in prometaphase and disappears in telophase, and that this hyperphosphorylated form of H1.5 is mainly chromatin-bound in metaphase when chromatin condensation is maximal. In search of the kinase responsible for the phosphorylation at this site, we found that threonine 10 of H1.5 can be phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase-3 in vitro, but not by cyclin-dependent kinase 1/cyclin B and cyclin-dependent kinase 5/p35, respectively. Furthermore, addition of specific glycogen synthase kinase-3 inhibitors led to a reduction in phosphorylation at this site both in vivo and in vitro.
