thermodynamics of loop formation in the denatured state of rhodopseudomonas palustris cytochrome c   scaling exponents and the reconciliation problem
the observation that denatured proteins yield scaling exponents   consistent with random coil behavior and yet can also have pockets of residual or nonrandom structure has been termed the  reconciliation problem   to provide greater insight into the denatured state of a foldable sequence we have measured histidine  heme loop formation equilibria in the denatured state of a class ii c type cytochrome cytochrome c  from rhodopseudomonas palustris we have prepared a series of variants that provide his  heme loop stabilities pkloop his  for loop sizes ranging from  to   residues at intervals of  to  residues along the sequence of the protein we observe a scaling exponent for loop formation    of      theoretical values for   range from   to   thus the observed   is consistent with random coil behavior however in contrast to data for loop formation as a function of loop size obtained with peptides of homogeneous sequence we observe considerable scatter about the linear dependence of loop stability on loop size thus foldable sequences behave very differently from homogeneous peptide sequences the observed scatter suggests that there is considerable variation in the conformational properties along the backbone of a foldable sequence consistent with alternating compact and extended regions with regard to the reconciliation problem it is evident that a scaling exponent consistent with a random coil is necessary but not sufficient to demonstrate random coil behavior
