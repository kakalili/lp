solution structures of uba domains reveal a conserved hydrophobic surface for protein  protein interactions
uba domains are a commonly occurring sequence motif of    amino acid residues that are found in diverse proteins involved in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway dna excision repair and cell signaling via protein kinases the human homologue of yeast rad a hhr a is one example of a nucleotide excision repair protein that contains both an internal and a c terminal uba domain the solution structure of hhr a uba  showed that the domain forms a compact three helix bundle we report the structure of the internal uba  domain of hhr a comparison of the structures of uba  and uba  reveals that both form very similar folds and have a conserved large hydrophobic surface patch the structural similarity between uba  and uba   in spite of their low level of sequence conservation leads us to conclude that the structural variability of uba domains in general is likely to be rather small on the basis of the structural similarities as well as analysis of sequence conservation we predict that this hydrophobic surface patch is a common protein interacting surface present in diverse uba domains furthermore accumulating evidence that ubiquitin binds to uba domains leads us to the prediction that the hydrophobic surface patch of uba domains interacts with the hydrophobic surface on the five stranded  sheet of ubiquitin detailed comparison of the structures of the two uba domains combined with previous mutagenesis studies indicates that the binding site of hiv  vpr on uba  does not completely overlap the ubiquitin binding site
