structure of human complement c  a precursor to membrane attack
complement component c plays a pivotal role in the formation of the membrane attack complex mac  an important antibacterial immune effector c initiates membrane penetration and coordinates mac pore formation high resolution structures of c subunits have provided some insight into the function of the c heterotrimer however there is no structural information describing how the intersubunit organization facilitates mac assembly we have determined the structure of c by electron microscopy and fitted the c  macpf membrane attack complex perforin c  co crystal structure and a homology model for c  macpf into the density here we demonstrate that both the c  protrusion and the c  macpf region that inserts into the membrane upon activation are accessible
