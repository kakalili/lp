physical and functional interactions between the prostate suppressor homeoprotein nkx  and serum response factor
the nkx  transcription factor is an nk family homeodomain protein and a tumor suppressor gene that is haploinsufficient and down regulated in the early phases of prostate cancer like its cardiac homolog nkx   nkx  acts synergistically with serum response factor srf to activate expression from the smooth muscle  actin smga gene promoter using nmr spectroscopy three conserved motifs in a construct containing the n terminal region and homeodomain of nkx  were observed to interact with the mads box domain of srf these motifs interacted both in the absence of dna and when both proteins were bound to a smga promoter dna sequence no significant interaction was seen between the homeodomain and srf mads box one of the srf interacting regions was the tinman tn or engrailed homology  motif eh   residues     fliqdil  which for other nk proteins is the site of interaction with the repressor protein groucho a second hydrophobic interacting region was designated the srf interacting si motif and included residues      lgsylld  a third interacting motif was the acidic region adjacent to the si motif including residues     etlaetepe  the acidic domain ad motif signals also showed strengthening upon the nkx  homeodomain binding to dna in the absence of srf consistent with the acidic region weakly interacting with the homeodomain in the unbound state the importance of these linear motifs in the transcriptional interaction of nkx  and srf was demonstrated by targeted mutagenesis of an nkx  expression vector in a smga reporter assay the results implicate the nkx  n terminal region in regulation of transcriptional activity of this tumor suppressor
