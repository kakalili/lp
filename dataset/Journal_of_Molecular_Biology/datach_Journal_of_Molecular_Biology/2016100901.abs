an extended loop of the pup ligase pafa mediates interaction with protein targets
pupylation the bacterial equivalent of ubiquitylation involves the conjugation of a prokaryotic ubiquitin like protein pup to protein targets in contrast to the ubiquitin system where many ubiquitin ligases exist a single bacterial ligase pafa catalyzes the conjugation of pup to a wide array of protein targets as mediators of target recognition by pafa have not been identified it would appear that pafa alone determines pupylation target selection previous studies indicated that broad specificity and promiscuity are indeed inherent pafa characteristics that probably dictate which proteins are selected for degradation by the pup proteasome system nonetheless despite the canonical role played by pafa in the pup proteasome system the molecular mechanism that dictates target binding by pafa remains uncharacterized since the discovery of this enzyme about a decade ago in this study we report the identification of pafa residues involved in the binding of protein targets initially docking analysis predicted the residues on pafa with high potential for target binding mutational and biochemical approaches subsequently confirmed these predictions and identified a series of additional residues located on an extended loop at the edge of the pafa active site mutating residues in this loop rendered pafa defective in the pupylation of a wide variety of protein targets but not in its catalytic mechanism suggesting an important role for this extended loop in the binding of protein targets as such these findings pave the way toward an understanding of the molecular determinants that dictate the broad substrate specificity of pafa
