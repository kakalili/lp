structural and functional characterisation of a conserved archaeal rada paralog with antirecombinase activity
dna recombinases reca in bacteria rad  in eukarya and rada in archaea catalyse strand exchange between homologous dna molecules the central reaction of homologous recombination and are among the most conserved dna repair proteins known reca is the sole protein responsible for this reaction in bacteria whereas there are several rad  paralogs that cooperate to catalyse strand exchange in eukaryotes all archaea have at least one and as many as four rada paralog but their function remains unclear herein we show that the three rada paralogs encoded by the sulfolobus solfataricus genome are expressed under normal growth conditions and are not uv inducible we demonstrate that one of these proteins sso   which is representative of the large archaeal radc subfamily of archaeal rada paralogs functions as an atpase that binds tightly to single stranded dna however sso   is not an active recombinase in vitro and inhibits d loop formation by rada we present the high resolution crystal structure of sso   which reveals key structural differences from the canonical reca family recombinases that may explain its functional properties the possible roles of the archaeal rada paralogs in vivo are discussed
