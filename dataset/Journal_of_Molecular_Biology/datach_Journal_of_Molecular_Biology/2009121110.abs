segmented helical structure of the neck region of the glycan binding receptor dc signr
carbohydrate recognition domains crds in the glycan binding receptors dc sign dendritic cell specific intercellular adhesion molecule  grabbing nonintegrin cd   and dc signr dc sign related receptor also known as l sign and variously designated cd  l and cd   are projected from the membrane surface by extended neck domains containing multiple repeats of a largely conserved  amino acid sequence motif crystals of a fragment of the neck domain of dc signr containing multiple repeats in which each molecule extends through multiple unit cells such that the observed crystallographic asymmetric unit represents one repeat averaged over six repeats of the protein have been obtained the repeats are largely  helical based on the structure and arrangement of the repeats in the crystal the neck region can be described as a series of four helix bundles connected by short non helical linkers combining the structure of the isolated neck domain with a previously determined overlapping structure of the distal end of the neck region with the crds attached provides a model of the almost complete extracellular portion of the receptor the results are consistent with previous characterization of the extended structure for the isolated neck region and the extracellular domain the organization of the neck suggests how crds may be disposed differently in dc sign compared with dc signr and in variant forms of dc signr assembled from polypeptides with different numbers of repeats in the neck domain
