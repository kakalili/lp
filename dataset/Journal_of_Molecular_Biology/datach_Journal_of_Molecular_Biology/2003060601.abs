analysis of ncp dependent activation of hiv  cdna integration and its conservation among retroviral nucleocapsid proteins
hiv  nucleocapsid protein ncp is a small basic protein with two zinc fingers found in the virion core where several hundred molecules coat the genomic rna ncp has nucleic acid chaperone properties that guide reverse transcriptase rt to synthesize the proviral dna flanked by the long terminal repeats ltr  in vitro ncp can strongly activate magnesium dependent ltr dna strand transfer by integrase in  here we show that in activation relies on both the basic residues and the zinc fingers of ncp  ncp lacking the zinc fingers binds dna but moderately stimulates strand transfer by in the ncp zinc finger domain binds dna poorly and does not efficiently stimulate in activity however the nc zinc finger domain can complement dna binding to restore full activation of strand transfer by in we propose that the basic residues and the zinc fingers function together to stabilize in at the ltr ends and promote the formation of a nucleoprotein complex competent for integration we also show that these properties of hiv  ncp are remarkably conserved among nucleocapsid proteins of retrotransposon and retrovirus origins
