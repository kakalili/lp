the roles of actin binding domains  and  in the calcium dependent regulation of actin filament bundling by human plastins
the actin cytoskeleton is a complex network controlled by a vast array of intricately regulated actin binding proteins human plastins pls  pls  and pls  are evolutionary conserved proteins that non covalently crosslink actin filaments into tight bundles through stabilization of such bundles plastins contribute in an isoform specific manner to the formation of kidney and intestinal microvilli inner ear stereocilia immune synapses endocytic patches adhesion contacts and invadosomes of immune and cancer cells all plastins comprise an n terminal ca  binding regulatory headpiece domain followed by two actin binding domains abd and abd  actin bundling occurs due to simultaneous binding of both abds to separate actin filaments bundling is negatively regulated by ca  but the mechanism of this inhibition remains unknown in this study we found that the bundling abilities of pls and pls were similarly sensitive to ca  pca     whereas pls was less sensitive pca     at the same time all three isoforms bound to f actin in a ca  independent manner suggesting that binding of only one of the abds is inhibited by ca  using limited proteolysis and mass spectrometry we found that in the presence of ca  the ef hands of human plastins bound to an immediately adjacent sequence homologous to canonical calmodulin binding peptides furthermore our data from differential centrifugation f rster resonance energy transfer native electrophoresis and chemical crosslinking suggest that ca  does not affect abd but inhibits the ability of abd to interact with actin a structural mechanism of signal transmission from ca  to abd through ef hands remains to be established
