distinct determinants of trna recognition by the trmd and trm methyl transferases
trmd and trm are respectively the bacterial and eukarya archaea methyl transferases that catalyze transfer of the methyl group from s adenosyl methionine adomet to the n position of g  in trna to synthesize m g  trna the m g  modification prevents trna frameshifts on the ribosome by assuring correct codon  anticodon pairings and thus is essential for the fidelity of protein synthesis although trmd and trm are derived from unrelated adomet families and recognize the cofactor using distinct motifs the question of whether they select g  on trna by the same or different mechanism has not been answered here we address this question by kinetic analysis of trna truncation mutants that lack domains typically present in the canonical l shaped structure and by evaluation of the site of modification on trna variants with an expanded or contracted anticodon loop with both experimental approaches we show that trmd and trm exhibit separate and distinct mode of trna recognition suggesting that they evolved by independent and non overlapping pathways from their unrelated adomet families our results also shed new light onto the significance of the m g  modification in the controversial quadruplet pairing model of trna frameshift suppressors
