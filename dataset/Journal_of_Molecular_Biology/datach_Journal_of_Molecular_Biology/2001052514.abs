foki requires two specific dna sites for cleavage edited by t richmond
foki is a bipartite restriction endonuclease that recognizes a non palindromic dna sequence and then makes double stranded cuts outside of that sequence to leave a   overhang earlier kinetic and crystallographic studies suggested that foki might function as a dimer here we show using dynamic light scattering gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation that foki dimerizes only in the presence of divalent metal ions furthermore analysis of the dna bound complex reveals that two copies of the recognition sequence are incorporated into the dimeric complex and that formation of this complex is essential for full activation of cleavage these results have broad implications for the mechanism by which monomeric type ii endonucleases achieve high fidelity
