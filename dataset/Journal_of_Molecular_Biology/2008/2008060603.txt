Overall structural changes of enzymes in response to ligand binding were investigated by database analysis of 62 non-redundant enzymes whose ligand-unbound and ligand-bound forms were available in the Protein Data Bank. The results of analysis indicate that transferases often undergo large rigid-body domain motions upon ligand binding, while other enzymes, most typically, hydrolases, change their structures to a small extent. It was also found that the solvent accessibility of the substrate molecule was low in transferases but high in hydrolases. These differences are explained by the enzymatic reaction mechanisms. The transferase reaction requires the catalytic groups to be insulated from the water environment, and thus transferases bury the ligand molecule inside the protein by closing the cleft. On the other hand, the hydrolase reaction involves the surrounding water molecules and occurs at the protein surface, requiring only a small structural change.
