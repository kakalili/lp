structural insights into the protease like antigen plasmodium falciparum sera and its noncanonical active site serine
the sera genes of the malaria causing parasite plasmodium encode a family of unique proteins that are maximally expressed at the time of egress of parasites from infected red blood cells these multi domain proteins are unique containing a central papain like cysteine protease fragment enclosed between the disulfide linked n and c terminal domains however the central fragment of several members of this family including serine repeat antigen  sera  contains a serine s   in place of the active site cysteine here we report the crystal structure of the central protease like domain of plasmodium falciparum sera  revealing a number of anomalies in addition to the putative nucleophilic serine   the structure of the putative active site is not conducive to binding substrate in the canonical cysteine protease manner   the side chain of d  restricts access of substrate to the putative active site and   the s specificity pocket is occupied by the side chain of y   reducing this site to a small depression on the protein surface attempts to determine the structure in complex with known inhibitors were not successful thus despite having revealed its structure the function of the catalytic domain of sera remains an enigma
