crystal structures of cystathionine  synthase inhibitor complexes rationalize the increased affinity of a novel inhibitor edited by j thornton
cystathionine  synthase catalyzes the committed step of methionine biosynthesis this pathway is unique to microorganisms and plants rendering the enzyme an attractive target for the development of antimicrobials and herbicides we solved the crystal structures of complexes of cystathionine  synthase cgs from nicotiana tabacum with inhibitors of different compound classes the complex with the substrate analog dl e  amino  phosphono  pentenoic acid verifies the carboxylate binding function of arg  and identifies the phosphate binding pocket of the active site the structure shows the function of lys  in specificity determination and suggests a role for the flexible side chain of tyr  in catalysis the importance of hydrophobic interactions for binding to the active site center is highlighted by the complex with  phosphonomethyl pyridine  carboxylic acid the low affinity of this compound is due to the non optimal arrangement of the functional groups binding to the phosphate and carboxylate recognition site respectively the newly identified inhibitor  carboxymethylthio     chlorophenyl    oxadiazol in contrast shows the highest affinity to cgs reported so far this affinity is due to binding to an additional active site pocket not used by the physiological substrates the inhibitor binds to the carboxylate recognition site and its tightly bent conformation enables it to occupy the novel binding pocket between arg  and ser   the described structures suggest improvements for known inhibitors and give guidelines for the development of new lead compounds
