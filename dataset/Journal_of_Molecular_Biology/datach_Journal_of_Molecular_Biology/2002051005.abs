the x ray crystallographic structure of the angiogenesis inhibitor angiostatin
angiogenesis inhibitors have gained much public attention recently as anti cancer agents and several are currently in clinical trials including angiostatin phase i thomas jefferson university hospital philadelphia pa  we report here the bowl shaped structure of angiostatin kringles    the first multi kringle structure to be determined all three kringle lysine binding sites contain a bound bicine molecule of crystallization while the former of kringle  and kringle  are cofacial moreover the separation of the kringle  and kringle  lysiner binding sites is sufficient to accommodate the  helix of the  residue peptide vek  found in the kringle  vek  complex together the three kringles produce a central cavity suggestive of a unique domain where they may function in concert
