repeated bottleneck transfers can lead to non cytocidal forms of a cytopathic virus implications for viral extinction
several biological subclones of a biological clone of foot and mouth disease virus fmdv have been subjected to many plaque to plaque serial bottleneck transfers in cell culture at transfer   to   clones underwent a transition towards a non cytolytic nc phenotype in which the virus was unable to produce plaques representing at least a   fold reduction in specific infectivity relative to the parental biological clone nc clones however were competent in rna replication and established a persistent infection in cell culture without an intervening cytolytic phase in one clone the transition to the nc phenotype was associated with the elongation of an internal oligodenylate tract that precedes the second functional aug translation initiation codon the pattern of mutations and their distribution along the fmdv genome of the clones subjected to serial bottleneck transfers were compared with the pattern of mutations in fmdv clones subjected to large population passages both the corrected ratios of non synonymous to synonymous mutations and some specific mutations in coding and non coding regions suggest participation of positive selection during large population passages and not during bottleneck transfers some mutations in the clones that attained the nc phenotype were located in genomic regions affecting the capacity of fmdv to kill bhk  cells the resistance to extinction of clones subjected to plaque to plaque transfers marks a striking contrast with regard to the ease of extinction mediated by lethal mutagenesis the results document a major phenotypic transition of a virus as a result of serial bottleneck events
