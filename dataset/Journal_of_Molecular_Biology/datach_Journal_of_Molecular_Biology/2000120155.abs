induction of lpl gene expression by sterols is mediated by a sterol regulatory element and is independent of the presence of multiple e boxes edited by m yaniv
overexpression of the adipocyte differentiation and determination factor  add  or sterol regulatory element binding protein  srebp  induces the expression of numerous genes involved in lipid metabolism including lipoprotein lipase lpl  therefore we investigated whether lpl gene expression is controlled by changes in cellular cholesterol concentration and determined the molecular pathways involved cholesterol depletion of culture medium resulted in a significant induction of lpl mrna in the t l preadipocyte cell line whereas addition of cholesterol reduced lpl mrna expression to basal levels similar to the expression of the endogenous lpl gene the activity of the human lpl gene promoter was enhanced by cholesterol depletion in transient transfection assays whereas addition of cholesterol caused a reversal of its induction the effect of cholesterol depletion upon the human lpl gene promoter was mimicked by cotransfection of expression constructs encoding the nuclear form of srebp a  c also called add  and srebp  bioinformatic analysis demonstrated the presence of  potential sterol regulatory elements sre and  add  binding sequences abs  also known as e box motifs using a combination of in vitro protein dna binding assays and transient transfection assays of reporter constructs containing mutations in each individual site a sequence element termed lpl sre  sre  was shown to be the principal site conferring sterol responsiveness upon the lpl promoter these data furthermore underscore the importance of sre sites relative to e boxes in the regulation of lpl gene expression by sterols and demonstrate that sterols contribute to the control of triglyceride metabolism via binding of srebp to the lpl regulatory sequences
