recognition of non  amino substrates by pyrrolysyl trna synthetase
pyrrolysyl trna synthetase pylrs  an aminoacyl trna synthetase aars recently found in some methanogenic archaea and bacteria recognizes an unusually large lysine derivative l pyrrolysine as the substrate and attaches it to the cognate trna trnapyl  the pylrs  trnapyl pair interacts with none of the endogenous aars  trna pairs in escherichia coli and thus can be used as a novel aars  trna pair for genetic code expansion the crystal structures of the methanosarcina mazei pylrs revealed that it has a unique large pocket for amino acid binding and the wild type m mazei pylrs recognizes the natural lysine derivative as well as many lysine analogs including n  tert butoxycarbonyl l lysine boc lysine  with diverse side chain sizes and structures moreover the pylrs only loosely recognizes the  amino group of the substrate whereas most aarss including the structurally and genetically related phenylalanyl trna synthetase phers  strictly recognize the main chain groups of the substrate we report here that wild type pylrs can recognize substrates with a variety of main chain  groups   hydroxyacid non  amino carboxylic acid n  methyl amino acid and d amino acid each with the same side chain as that of boc lysine in contrast phers recognizes none of these amino acid analogs by expressing the wild type pylrs and its cognate trnapyl in e coli in the presence of the  hydroxyacid analog of boc lysine boc lysoh  the amber codon uag was recoded successfully as boc lysoh and thus an ester bond was site specifically incorporated into a protein molecule this pylrs  trnapyl pair is expected to expand the backbone diversity of protein molecules produced by both in vivo and in vitro ribosomal translation
