transition states in protein folding kinetics the structural interpretation of  values
values are experimental measures of the effects of mutations on the folding kinetics of a protein a central question is what structural information  values give about the transition state of folding traditionally a  value is interpreted as representing the  nativeness  of a mutated residue in the transition state however this interpretation is often problematic we present here a better structural interpretation of  values for mutations within a given helix our interpretation is based on a simple physical model that distinguishes between secondary and tertiary free energy contributions of helical residues from a linear fit of the model to experimental data we obtain two structural parameters the extent of helix formation in the transition state and the nativeness of tertiary interactions in the transition state we apply the model to all proteins with well characterized helices for which more than    values are available protein a ci  and protein l the model is simple to apply to experimental data captures nonclassical  values lt  or gt  in these helices and explains how different mutations at a given site can lead to different  values
