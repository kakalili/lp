a hierarchic approach to the design of hexameric helical barrels
the design of large macromolecular assemblies is an endeavor with implications for protein engineering as well as nanotechnology a hierarchic approach was used to design an antiparallel hexameric tubular assembly of helices in previous studies a domain swapped dimeric three helix bundle was designed from first principles in the crystal lattice three dimers associate around a  fold rotational axis to form a hexameric assembly although this hexameric assembly was not observed in solution it was possible to stabilize its formation by changing three polar residues per monomer to hydrophobic two phe and one trp residues molecular models based on the crystallographic coordinates of dsd pdb accession code g u show that these side chains pack in the central cavity the  supercore   of the hexameric bundle analytical ultracentrifugation fluorescence spectroscopy cd spectroscopy and guanidine  hcl denaturation were used to determine the assembly of the hexamer to probe the requirements for stabilizing the hexamer we systematically varied the polarity and steric bulk of one of the phe residues in the supercore of the hexamer depending on the nature of this side chain it is possible to modulate the stability of the hexamer in a predictable manner this family of hexameric proteins may provide a useful framework for the construction of proteins that change their oligomeric states in response to binding of small molecules
