visualizing the assembly of human rad  filaments on double stranded dna
rad  is the core component of the eukaryotic homologous recombination machinery and assembles into extended nucleoprotein filaments on dna to study the dynamic behavior of rad  we have developed a single molecule assay that relies on a combination of hydrodynamic force and microscale diffusion barriers to align individual dna molecules on the surface of a microfluidic sample chamber that is coated with a lipid bilayer when visualized with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy tirfm  these  molecular curtains  allow for the direct visualization of hundreds of individual dna molecules using this approach we have analyzed the binding of human rad  to single molecules of double stranded dna under a variety of different reaction conditions by monitoring the extension of the fluorescently labeled dna which coincides with assembly of the nucleoprotein filament we have also generated several mutants in conserved regions of rad  implicated in dna binding and tested them for their ability to assemble into extended filaments we show that proteins with mutations within the dna binding surface located on the n terminal domain still retain the ability to form extended nucleoprotein filaments mutations in the l loop which projects towards the central axis of the filament completely abolish assembly of extended filaments in contrast most mutations within or near the l dna binding loop which is also located near the central axis of the filament do not affect the ability of the protein to assemble into extended filaments on double stranded ds dna taken together these results demonstrate that the l loop plays a crucial role in the assembly of extended nucleoprotein filaments on dsdna but the n terminal domain and the l dna binding loop have significantly less impact on this process the results presented here also provide an important initial framework for beginning to study the biochemical behaviors of rad  nucleoprotein filaments using our novel experimental system
