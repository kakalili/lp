the knotted protein uch l exhibits partially unfolded forms under native conditions that share common structural features with its kinetic folding intermediates
the human ubiquitin c terminal hydrolase uch l  is an abundant neuronal deubiquitinase that is associated with parkinson  s disease it contains a complex gordian knot topology formed by the polypeptide chain alone using a combination of fluorescence based kinetic measurements we show that uch l has two distinct kinetic folding intermediates that are transiently populated on parallel pathways between the denatured and native states nmr hydrogen deuterium exchange hdx experiments indicate the presence of partially unfolded forms pufs of uch l under native conditions hdx measurements as a function of urea concentration were used to establish the structure of the pufs and pulse labelled hdx nmr was used to show that the pufs and the folding intermediates are likely the same species in both cases a similar stable core encompassing most of the central  sheet is highly structured and  helix  which is partially formed packs against it in contrast to the stable  sheet core the peripheral  helices display significant local fluctuations leading to rapid exchange the results also suggest that the main difference between the two kinetic intermediates is structure and packing of  helices  and  and the degree of structure in  strand  together the fluorescence and nmr results establish that uch l neither folds through a continuum of pathways nor by a single discrete pathway its folding is complex the  sheet core forms early and is present in both intermediate states and the rate limiting step which is likely to involve the threading of the chain to form the  knot occurs late on the folding pathway
