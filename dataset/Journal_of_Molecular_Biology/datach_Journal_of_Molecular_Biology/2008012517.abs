characterization of a novel prokaryotic gdp dissociation inhibitor domain from the g protein coupled membrane protein feob
the feob family of membrane embedded g proteins are involved with high affinity fe ii uptake in prokaryotes here we report that feob harbors a novel gdp dissociation inhibitor like domain that specifically stabilizes gdp binding through an interaction with the switch i region of the g protein we show that the stabilization of gdp binding is conserved between species despite a high degree of sequence variability in their guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor gdi like domains and demonstrate that the presence of the membrane embedded domain increases gdp binding affinity roughly   fold over the level accomplished by action of the gdi like domain alone to our knowledge this is the first example for a prokaryotic gdi targeting a bacterial g protein coupled membrane process our findings suggest that fe ii uptake in bacteria involves a g protein regulatory pathway reminiscent of signaling mechanisms found in higher order organisms
