the positive transcription elongation factor b is an essential cofactor for the activation of transcription by myocyte enhancer factor
the positive transcription elongation factor b p tefb  composed of cyclin dependent kinase  and cyclin t  stimulates the elongation of transcription by hyperphosphorylating the c terminal region of rna polymerase ii aberrant activation of p tefb results in manifestations of cardiac hypertrophy in mice suggesting that p tefb is an essential factor for cardiac myocyte function and development here we present evidence that p tefb selectively activates transcription mediated by the myocyte enhancer factor  mef  family of transcription factors key regulatory factors for myocyte development knockdown of endogenous cyclin t in murine c c  cells abolishes mef dependent reporter gene expression as well as transcription of endogenous mef target genes whereas overexpression of p tefb enhances mef dependent transcription p tefb interacts with mef both in vitro and in vivo activation of mef dependent transcription induced by serum starvation is mediated by a rapid dissociation of p tefb from its inhibitory subunit hexim  and a subsequent recruitment of p tefb to mef binding sites in the promoter region of mef target genes these results indicate that recruitment of p tefb is a critical step for stimulation of mef dependent transcription therefore providing a fundamentally important regulatory mechanism underlying the transcriptional program in muscle cells
