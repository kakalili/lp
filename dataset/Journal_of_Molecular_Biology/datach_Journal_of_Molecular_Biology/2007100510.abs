structures of mart       peptide hla a complexes reveal a remarkable disconnect between antigen structural homology and t cell recognition
small structural changes in peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex mhc molecules often result in large changes in immunogenicity supporting the notion that t cell receptors are exquisitely sensitive to antigen structure yet there are striking examples of tcr recognition of structurally dissimilar ligands the resulting unpredictability of how t cells will respond to different or modified antigens impacts both our understanding of the physical bases for tcr specificity as well as efforts to engineer peptides for immunomodulation in cancer immunotherapy epitopes and variants derived from the mart  melan a protein are widely used as clinical vaccines two overlapping epitopes spanning amino acid residues  through  are of particular interest numerous clinical studies have been performed using variants of the mart      decamer although only the     nonamer has been found on the surface of targeted melanoma cells here we show that the     and     peptides adopt strikingly different conformations when bound to hla a  nevertheless clonally distinct mart       reactive t cells show broad cross reactivity towards these ligands simultaneously however many of the cross reactive t cells remain unable to recognize anchor modified variants with very subtle structural differences these dichotomous observations challenge our thinking about how structural information on unligated peptide mhc complexes should be best used when addressing questions of tcr specificity our findings also indicate that caution is warranted in the design of immunotherapeutics based on the mart       epitopes as neither cross reactivity nor selectivity is predictable based on the analysis of the structures alone
