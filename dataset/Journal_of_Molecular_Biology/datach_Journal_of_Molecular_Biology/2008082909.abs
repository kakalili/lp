structure of a second brct domain identified in the nijmegen breakage syndrome protein nbs and its function in an mdc dependent localization of nbs to dna damage sites
the nijmegen breakage syndrome protein nbs is a component of the mrn mre   rad   nbs  complex central to the dna damage response while nbs is generally believed to encompass a forkhead associated domain linked to a breast cancer c terminal brct domain to date there is no experimental information on its three dimensional structure through nuclear magnetic resonance nmr three dimensional structure determination we demonstrate that there is a second brct domain brct  in nbs  the domain has the characteristic brct topology but with a long insertion shown to be flexible by nmr relaxation measurements in the absence of sequence similarity to other proteins a search for structural analogs of brct returned the second brct domain of the tandem brct repeats of cell cycle checkpoint proteins mdc  mediator of dna damage checkpoint protein  and brca  breast cancer protein   suggesting that like mdc and brca  nbs also possesses tandem brct domains with phosphoprotein binding ability structure based single point mutations in human nbs were evaluated in vivo and revealed that brct is essential for an mdc dependent relocalization of nbs to dna damage sites most likely through a direct interaction of nbs tandem brct domains with phosphorylated mdc
