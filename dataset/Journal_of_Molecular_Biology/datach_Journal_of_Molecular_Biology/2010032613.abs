molecular determinants of pam recognition by the mlle domain of poly a binding protein
mlle previously known as pabc is a peptide binding domain that is found in poly a binding protein pabp and edd e isolated by differential display  a hect e ubiquitin ligase also known as hyd hyperplastic discs tumor suppressor or ubr  the mlle domain from pabp recruits various regulatory proteins and translation factors to poly a mrnas through binding of a conserved  amino acid peptide motif called pam  for pabp interacting motif   here we determined crystal structures of the mlle domain from pabp alone and in complex with pam peptides from pabp interacting protein  the structures provide a detailed view of hydrophobic determinants of the mlle binding coded by pam positions       and  and reveal novel intermolecular polar contacts in particular the side chain of the invariant mlle residue k  forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone of pam residues  and  the structures also show that peptide residues outside of the conserved pam motif contribute to binding altogether the structures provide a significant advance in understanding the molecular basis for the binding of pabp by pam containing proteins involved in translational control mrna deadenylation and other cellular processes
