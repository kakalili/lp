the alzheimer  s peptides a   and  adopt distinct conformations in water a combined md  nmr study
the role of peptides a   and a   in the early pathogenesis of alzheimer s disease ad is frequently emphasized in the literature it is known that a   is more prone to aggregation than a   even though they differ in only two ia amino acid residues at the c terminal end a direct comparison of the ensembles of conformations adopted by the monomers in solution has been limited by the inherent flexibility of the unfolded peptides here we characterize the conformations of a   and a   in water by using a combination of molecular dynamics md and measured scalar jhnh  data from nmr experiments we perform replica exchange md remd simulations and find that classical forcefields reproduce the nmr data quantitatively when the sampling is extended to the microseconds time scale using the quantitative agreement of the nmr data as a validation of the model we proceed to compare the conformational ensembles of the a   and a   peptide monomers our analysis confirms the existence of structured regions within the otherwise flexible a  peptides we find that the c terminus of a   is more structured than that of a   the formation of a  hairpin in the sequence  iiglmvggvvia involving short strands at residues     and     in bold reduces the c terminal flexibility of the a   peptide and may be responsible for the higher propensity of this peptide to form amyloids
