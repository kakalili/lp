comprehensive mutational analysis of the m  major coat protein improved scaffolds for c terminal phage display
a peptide was fused to the c terminus of the m  bacteriophage major coat protein p  and libraries of p mutants were screened to select for variants that displayed the peptide with high efficiency over   variants were sequenced to compile a comprehensive database of p sequence diversity compatible with assembly into the wild type phage coat the database reveals that while the  helical p molecule was highly tolerant to mutations certain functional epitopes were required for efficient incorporation three hydrophobic epitopes were located approximately equidistantly along the length of the  helix in addition a positively charged epitope was required directly opposite the most c terminal hydrophobic epitope and on the same side as the other two epitopes both ends of the protein were highly tolerant to mutations consistent with the use of p as a scaffold for both n and c terminal phage display further rounds of selection were used to enrich for p variants that supported higher levels of c terminal peptide display the largest improvements in display resulted from mutations around the junction between p and the c terminal linker and additional mutations in the n terminal region were selected for further improvements in display the best p variants improved c terminal display more than   fold relative to the wild type and these variants could support the simultaneous display of n and c terminal fusions these finding provide information on the requirements for filamentous phage coat assembly and provide improved scaffolds for phage display technology
