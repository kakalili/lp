synonymous codon usage affects the expression of wild type and f  del cftr
the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator cftr is an anion channel composed of   amino acids the major mutation responsible for cystic fibrosis results in loss of amino acid residue f   f  del  loss of f  in cftr alters the folding pathway resulting in endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation this study investigates the role of synonymous codon in the expression of cftr and cftr f  del in human hek  cells dna encoding the open reading frame orf for cftr containing synonymous codon replacements was expressed using a heterologous vector integrated into the genome the results indicate that the codon usage greatly affects the expression of cftr while the promoter strength driving expression of the orfs was largely unchanged and the mrna half lives were unchanged the steady state levels of the mrna varied by as much as  fold experiments support that this apparent inconsistency is attributed to nonsense mediated decay independent of exon junction complex the ratio of cftr mrna indicates that mrna containing native codons was more efficient in expressing mature cftr as compared to mrna containing synonymous high expression codons however when f  del cftr was expressed after codon optimization a greater percentage of the protein escaped endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation resulting in considerable levels of mature f  del cftr on the plasma membrane which showed channel activity these results indicate that codon usage has an effect on mrna levels and protein expression for cftr and likely on chaperone assisted folding pathway for f  del cftr
