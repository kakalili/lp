structural analysis and optimization of the covalent association between spycatcher and a peptide tag
peptide tagging is a key strategy for observing and isolating proteins however the interactions of proteins with peptides are nearly all rapidly reversible proteins tagged with the peptide spytag form an irreversible covalent bond to the spycatcher protein via a spontaneous isopeptide linkage thereby offering a genetically encoded way to create peptide interactions that resist force and harsh conditions here we determined the crystal structure of the reconstituted covalent complex of spytag and spycatcher at    resolution the structure showed the expected reformation of the  sandwich domain seen in the parental streptococcal adhesin but flanking sequences at both n and c termini of spycatcher were disordered in addition only  out of  amino acids of the spytag peptide were observed to interact with spycatcher pointing to specific contacts important for rapid split protein reconstitution based on these structural insights we expressed a range of spycatcher variants and identified a minimized spycatcher   residues shorter that maintained rapid reaction with spytag together these results give insight into split protein  strand complementation and enhance a distinct approach to ultrastable molecular interaction
