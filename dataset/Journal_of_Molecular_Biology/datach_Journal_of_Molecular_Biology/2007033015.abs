the grb pld interaction is essential for lipase activity intracellular localization and signaling in response to egf
the adaptor protein grb associates with phospholipase d  pld  but it is not known if this interaction is necessary for the functionality of the lipase in vivo we demonstrate that stable short hairpin rna shrna based silencing of grb  a critical signal transducer of the epidermal growth factor receptor egfr and linker to the ras erk pathway resulted in the reduction of pld activity in cos cells transfection of a grb construct refractory to shgrb silencing xgrb sil into the grb knockdown cells cos shgrb  resulted in the nearly full rescue of pld activity however grb r k an sh deficient mutant of grb that is incapable of binding to pld  failed to induce an enhancement of the impaired pld activity in cos shgrb cells grb and pld are directly associated and grb is brought down with anti myc antibodies irrespective of the presence or absence of egfr activation immunofluorescence microscopy showed that co transfected pld and grb re localize to golgi like structures after egf stimulation since this was not observed in cotransfection experiments with grb and pld y    f a lipase mutant that does not bind to grb  we inferred that grb serves to hijack pld to the perinuclear golgi region through its sh domain supporting this is the finding that the primary cell line huvec expresses pld diffusely in the cytoplasm and in the perinuclear golgi region where pld and grb colocalize such colocalization in primary cells increased after stimulation with egf these results demonstrate for the first time that the presence of grb and its interaction with localized intracellular structures is essential for pld activity and signaling in vivo
