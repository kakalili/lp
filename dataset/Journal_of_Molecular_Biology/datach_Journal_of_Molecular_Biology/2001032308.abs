an interfacial mechanism and a class of inhibitors inferred from two crystal structures of the mycobacterium tuberculosis  kda major secretory protein antigen  b  a mycolyl transferase edited by i a wilson
the mycobacterium tuberculosis  kda major secretory protein antigen  b is the most abundant protein exported by m tuberculosis as well as a potent immunoprotective antigen and a leading drug target a mycolyl transferase of   residues it is closely related to two other mycolyl transferases each of molecular mass  kda antigen  a and antigen  c all three catalyze transfer of the fatty acid mycolate from one trehalose monomycolate to another resulting in trehalose dimycolate and free trehalose thus helping to build the bacterial cell wall we have determined two crystal structures of m tuberculosis antigen  b ag b  initially by molecular replacement using antigen  c as a probe the apo ag b model is refined against    data to an r factor of    rfree is     and includes all residues except the n terminal phe the active site immobilizes a molecule of the cryoprotectant  methyl   pentanediol crystal growth with addition of trehalose resulted in a second ag b crystal structure     resolution r factor is    rfree is     trehalose binds in two sites at opposite ends of the active site cleft in our proposed mechanism model the trehalose at the active site ser  represents the trehalose liberated by temporary esterification of ser   while the other trehalose represents the incoming trehalose monomycolate just prior to swinging over to the first trehalose site to displace the mycolate from its serine ester our proposed interfacial mechanism minimizes aqueous exposure of the apolar mycolates based on the trehalose bound structure we suggest a new class of antituberculous drugs made by connecting two trehalose molecules by an amphipathic linker
