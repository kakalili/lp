equilibrium and kinetic folding of rabbit muscle triosephosphate isomerase by hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry
unfolding and refolding of rabbit muscle triosephosphate isomerase tim  a model for     barrel proteins has been studied by amide hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry unfolding was studied by destabilizing the protein in guanidine hydrochloride gdhcl or urea pulse labeling with h o and analyzing the intact protein by hplc electrospray ionization mass spectrometry bimodal isotope patterns were found in the mass spectra of the labeled protein indicating two state unfolding behavior refolding experiments were performed by diluting solutions of tim unfolded in gdhcl or urea and pulse labeling with h o at different times mass spectra of the intact protein labeled after one to two minutes had three envelopes of isotope peaks indicating population of an intermediate kinetic modeling indicates that the stability of the folding intermediate in water is only  kcal mol failure to detect the intermediate in the unfolding experiments was attributed to its low stability and the high concentrations of denaturant required for unfolding experiments the folding status of each segment of the polypeptide backbone was determined from the deuterium levels found in peptic fragments of the labeled protein analysis of these spectra showed that the c terminal half folds to form the intermediate which then forms native tim with folding of the n terminal half these results show that tim folding fits the    model for folding of     barrel proteins results of a double jump experiment indicate that proline isomerization does not contribute to the rate limiting step in the folding of tim
