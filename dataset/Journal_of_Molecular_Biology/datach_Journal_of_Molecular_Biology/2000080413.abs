a two stranded template based approach to g  c a triad formation designing novel structural elements into an existing dna framework edited by m summers
we have designed a dna sequence d g g g t t c a g g  which dimerizes to form a  fold symmetric g quadruplex in which g syn  g anti  g syn  g anti tetrads are sandwiched between all trans g  c a triads the nmr based solution structural analysis was greatly aided by monitoring hydrogen bond alignments across nh   n and nh   oc hydrogen bonds within the triad and tetrad in a uniformly  c  n labeled sample of the d g g g t t c a g g sequence the solution structure establishes that the guanine base pairs with the cytosine through watson crick g c pair formation and with adenine through sheared g a mismatch formation within the g  c a triad a model of triad dna was constructed that contains the experimentally determined g  c a triad alignment as the repeating stacked unit
