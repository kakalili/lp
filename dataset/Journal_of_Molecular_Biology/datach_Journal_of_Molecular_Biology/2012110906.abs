kinetics and thermodynamics of phenotype unwinding and rewinding the nucleosome
chromatin  remodeling  is widely accepted as the mechanism that permits access to dna by the transcription machinery to date however there has been no experimental measurement of the changes in the kinetics and thermodynamics of the dna  histone octamer association that are required to remodel chromatin so that transcription may occur here we present the results of optical tweezer measurements that compare the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of nucleosomes composed of unmodified histones with those of nucleosomes that contain a mutant histone h  h r h  which has been shown to allow swi snf remodeling factor independent transcription from the yeast ho promoter in vivo our measurements carried out in a force clamp mode determine the force dependent unwinding and rewinding rates of the nucleosome inner turn at each force studied nucleosomes containing h r h unwind more rapidly and rewind more slowly than nucleosomes containing unmodified h  indicating that the latter are the more stable extrapolation to forces at which the winding and unwinding rates are equal determines the absolute free energy of the nucleosome inner turn to be   kbt for nucleosomes containing unmodified h and   kbt for nucleosomes containing h r h thus the  loosening  or  remodeling  caused by this point mutation which is demonstrated to be sufficient to allow transcriptional machinery access to the ho promoter in the absence of other remodeling factors  is kbt the correlation between the free energy of the nucleosome inner turn and the sin swi snf independent transcription suggests that beyond partial unwinding complete histone unwinding may play a role in transcriptional activation
