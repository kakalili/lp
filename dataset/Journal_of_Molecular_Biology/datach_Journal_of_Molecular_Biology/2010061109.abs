monomeric rhodopsin is the minimal functional unit required for arrestin binding
we have tested whether arrestin binding requires the g protein coupled receptor be a dimer or a multimer to do this we encapsulated single rhodopsin molecules into nanoscale phospholipid particles so called nanodiscs and measured their ability to bind arrestin our data clearly show that both visual arrestin and  arrestin  can bind to monomeric rhodopsin and stabilize the active metarhodopsin ii form interestingly we find that the monomeric rhodopsin in nanodiscs has a higher affinity for wild type arrestin binding than does oligomeric rhodopsin in liposomes or nanodiscs as assessed by stabilization of metarhodopsin ii together these results establish that rhodopsin self association is not required to enable arrestin binding
