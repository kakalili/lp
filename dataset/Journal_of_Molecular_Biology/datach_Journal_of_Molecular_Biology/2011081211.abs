nascent peptide side chains induce rearrangements in distinct locations of the ribosomal tunnel
although we have numerous structures of ribosomes none disclose side chain rearrangements of the nascent peptide during chain elongation this study reports for the first time that rearrangement of the peptide and or tunnel occurs in distinct regions of the tunnel and is directed by the unique primary sequence of each nascent peptide in the tunnel mid region the accessibility of an introduced cysteine to a series of novel hydrophilic maleimide reagents increases with increasing volume of the adjacent chain residue a sensitivity not manifest at the constriction and exit port this surprising result reveals molecular movements not yet resolvable from structural studies these findings map solvent accessible volumes along the tunnel and provide novel insights critical to our understanding of allosteric communication within the ribosomal tunnel translational arrest chaperone interaction folding and rates of elongation
