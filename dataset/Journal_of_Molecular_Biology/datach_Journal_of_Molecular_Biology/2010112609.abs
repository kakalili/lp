evolutionary origin of a secondary structure   helices as cryptic but widespread insertional variations of  helices that enhance protein functionality
formally annotated  helices are rare in protein structures but have been correlated with functional sites here we analyze protein structures to show that  helices are the same as structures known as  bulges   aneurisms   bulges and looping outs and are evolutionarily derived by the insertion of a single residue into an  helix this newly discovered evolutionary origin explains both why  helices are cryptic being rarely annotated despite occurring in   of known proteins and why they tend to be associated with function an analysis of  helices in the diverse ferritin like superfamily illustrates their tendency to be conserved in protein families and identifies a putative  helix containing primordial precursor a  missing link  intermediary form of the ribonucleotide reductase family vestigial  helices and a novel function for  helices that we term a  peristaltic like shift   this new understanding of  helices paves the way for this generally overlooked motif to become a noteworthy feature that will aid in tracing the evolution of many protein families guide investigations of protein and  helix functionality and contribute additional tools to the protein engineering toolkit
