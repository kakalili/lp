molecular structure and interaction of recombinant human type xvi collagen
collagen xvi is a minor component of at least two different extracellular fibrillar networks of specialized regions of skin and cartilage in skin collagen xvi is integrated into particular fibrillin rich microfibrils lacking an amorphous elastin core in cartilage collagen xvi is a component of small heterotypic d banded fibrils mainly occurring in the territorial matrix of chondrocytes here we present the first direct evidence for the molecular structure and functional properties of these fibril associated collagens with interrupted triple helices facit  we have expressed recombinantly the full length   chain of human collagen xvi in hek   ebna cells in large quantities using an episomal expression system secreted full length recombinant collagen xvi forms stable disulfide bonded homotrimers and is rapidly proteolytically processed to distinct fragments at specific protease sequence motifs one resembling an aggrecanase recognition site limited trypsin digestion assays and thermal transition curves imply sequential thermal denaturation of individual triple helical domains of this recombinant collagen similar to authentic collagen xvi molecular images of collagen xvi reveal rod like molecules which harbor multiple sharp kinks attributing a highly flexible structure presumably introduced by non collagenous nc regions terminally located cloverleaf shaped nodules correspond to the large nc nc  domain of trimeric collagen xvi the total length of individual trimeric recombinant collagen xvi molecules constitutes about   nm as calculated by atomic force and negative staining electron microscopy recombinant collagen xvi interacts with fibrillin  and with fibronectin indicating multiple molecular interactions in which this ubiquitously expressed and versatile facit collagen can participate in vitro generated collagen xvi provides an indispensable tool for future determination of its function during supramolecular assembly of matrix aggregates and its role in maintenance organization and interaction of fibrillar structures
