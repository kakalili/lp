x ray radiation induced changes in bacteriorhodopsin structure
bacteriorhodopsin br provides light driven vectorial proton transport across a cell membrane creation of electrochemical potential at the membrane is a universal step in energy transformation in a cell published atomic crystallographic models of early intermediate states of br show a significant difference between them and conclusions about pumping mechanisms have been contradictory here we present a quantitative high resolution crystallographic study of conformational changes in br induced by x ray absorption it is shown that x ray doses that are usually accumulated during data collection for intermediate state studies are sufficient to significantly alter the structure of the protein x ray induced changes occur primarily in the active site of br structural modeling showed that x ray absorption triggers retinal isomerization accompanied by the disappearance of electron densities corresponding to the water molecule w  bound to the schiff base it is demonstrated that these and other x ray induced changes may mimic functional conformational changes of br leading to misinterpretation of the earlier obtained x ray crystallographic structures of photointermediates
