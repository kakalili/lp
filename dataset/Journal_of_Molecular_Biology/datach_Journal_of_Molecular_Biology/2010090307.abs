crystal structure of glyceraldehyde  phosphate dehydrogenase  from methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa  provides novel insights into substrate binding and catalytic mechanism
the dreaded pathogen staphylococcus aureus is one of the causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide glyceraldehyde  phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh  one of the key glycolytic enzymes is irreversibly oxidized under oxidative stress and is responsible for sustenance of the pathogen inside the host with an aim to elucidate the catalytic mechanism and identification of intermediates involved we describe in this study different crystal structures of gapdh from methicillin resistant s aureus mrsa   sagapdh  in apo and holo forms of wild type thioacyl intermediate and ternary complexes of active site mutants with physiological substrate d glyceraldehyde  phosphate g p and coenzyme nad  a new phosphate recognition site   new pi  site similar to that observed in gapdh from thermotoga maritima is reported here which is     away from the  classical pi  site ternary complexes discussed are representatives of noncovalent michaelis complexes in the ground state d g p is bound to all the four subunits of c  s nad and c  g nad in more reactive hydrate gem di ol form however in c  s h  n nad the substrate is bound to two chains in aldehyde form and in gem di ol form to the other two this work reports binding of d g p to the c  g mutant in an inverted manner for the very first time the structure of the thiaocyl complex presented here is formed after the hydride transfer the c phosphate of d g p is positioned at the  ps  site in the ternary complexes but at the  new pi  site in the thioacyl complex and c  o bond points opposite to his  disrupting the alignment between itself and ne of his   a new conformation conformation i of the      loop has also been identified where the interaction between phosphate ion at the  new pi  site and conserved gly  is lost altogether inferences drawn from the kinetic analyses and crystal structures suggest the  flip flop  model proposed for the enzyme mechanism
