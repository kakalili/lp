The basis for the choice of translational position of a histone octamer on DNA is poorly understood. To gain further insights into this question we have studied the translational and rotational settings of core particles assembled on a simple repeating 20 bp positioning sequence. We show that the translational positions of the core particles assembled on this sequence are invariant with respect to the DNA sequence and occur at 20 bp intervals. Certain modifications of the original sequence reduce the spacing of possible dyads to 10 bp. At least one of these alters both the translational and rotational settings. We conclude that the translational position of a core particle is specified by sequence determinants additional to those specifying rotational positioning. The rotational settings on either side of the dyads of core particles assembled on the wild-type and a mutant sequence differ by +2 bp, corresponding to an overall helical periodicity of ∼10.15 bp. The average helical periodicity of the central two to four turns is 10.5–11 bp whilst that of the flanking DNA is closer to 10 bp. The DNA immediately flanking the dyad is also characterised by a more extensive susceptibility to cleavage by hydroxyl radical.
