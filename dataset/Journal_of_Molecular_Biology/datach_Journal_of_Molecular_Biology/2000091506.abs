analysis of yeast msh msh suggests that the initiation of mismatch repair can be separated into discrete steps edited by m gottesman
the yeast msh msh complex is required to repair both base pair and single base insertion deletion mismatches msh msh binds to mismatch substrates and displays an atpase activity that is modulated by mispairs that are repaired in vivo to understand early steps in mismatch repair we analyzed mismatch repair mmr defective msh msh f  a and msh msh   complexes that contained amino acid substitutions in the msh mismatch recognition domain while both heterodimers were defective in forming stable complexes with mismatch substrates only msh msh   bound to homoduplex dna with an affinity that was similar to that observed for msh msh  additional analyses suggested that stable binding to a mispair is not sufficient to initiate recruitment of downstream repair factors previously we observed that msh msh forms a stable complex with a palindromic insertion mismatch that escapes correction by mmr in vivo here we show that this binding is not accompanied by either a modulation in msh msh atpase activity or an atp dependent recruitment of the mlh pms complex together these observations suggest that early stages in mmr can be divided into distinct recognition stable binding and downstream factor recruitment steps
