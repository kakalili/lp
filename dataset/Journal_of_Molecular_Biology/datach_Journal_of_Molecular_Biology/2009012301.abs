structural stabilities of different regions of the titin i  domain contribute differently to unfolding upon mitochondrial protein import
protein import into mitochondria requires unfolding of the folded mature domain of precursor proteins here we compared the effects of amino acid replacement between the core region and the n terminal region of the titin i  domain the  th ig domain of human titin on its import into isolated mitochondria when attached to a short presequence pb    we found that several mutations in the core region around trp  of the i  domain enhanced the import rates of the fusion proteins while the n terminal k p mutation which increases mechanical stability around the n terminal region decreases the import rate when the k p mutation is combined with core destabilizing mutations the import rates of the fusion proteins still decrease unless a long segment is deleted these results suggest that mutations in the core region could destabilize the transition state for unfolding from the intermediate with the detached n terminal segment during import leading to enhanced unfolding rates although stabilization of the n terminal region masks these effects in other words the rate limiting step of the global unfolding upon import into mitochondria switches depending on the balance between the stability of the n terminal structure and the stability of the core region of the i  domain
