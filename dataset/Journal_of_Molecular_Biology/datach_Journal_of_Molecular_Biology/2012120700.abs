how to distinguish methyl cytosine from cytosine with high fidelity
methylation of cytosines in the dna is central to the epigenetic code the patterns along the dna formed by these chemical marks instruct the cell which proteins to express and their faithful maintenance after replication are vital to the organism s life although dnmt is the enzyme catalyzing the methylation reaction it was found that uhrf  ubiquitin like containing phd and ring finger domain  is the protein that actually recognizes hemi methylated cpg sites nevertheless the physical mechanism driving the strikingly robust distinction between hemi methylated and unmethylated sites is not known in this paper we show that the large difference in the binding affinities of uhrf to these sites is possible not due to the presence of the methyl group itself but is a result of the accompanying changes in the distribution of the electrons around the cytosine ring in particular methylation reduces the dipole moment of cytosine and as a consequence unmethylated dna in its unbound state in water is more stable than hemi methylated dna furthermore the interaction energy of hemi methylated dna bound to uhrf with its surrounding is stronger than that of unmethylated dna thus the change in the electronic structure of cytosine upon methylation destabilizes the unbound state and stabilizes the bound state rendering discrimination with high fidelity possible
