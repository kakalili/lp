modulation of transcription reveals a new mechanism of triplet repeat instability in escherichia coli edited by m yaniv
many human hereditary disease genes are associated with the expansion of triplet repeat sequences in escherichia coli ctg cag triplet repeat sequences are unstable and we have developed a plasmid based assay enabling us to observe and quantify both expansions and deletions in this work we have investigated the role of transcription on the instability of a ctg cag insert containing  repeats using this assay we show that induction of transcription results in a significant increase in the frequency of long deletions and a reduction in the frequency of long expansions on the other hand overproduction of transcription repressor molecules leads to an increase in both expansions and deletions in this latter case we propose that the increased instability is due to the arrest of replication progression by the interaction of the repressor molecule with its cognate operator and subsequent generations of dna strand breaks
