folding topology of a bimolecular dna quadruplex containing a stable mini hairpin motif within the diagonal loop
we describe the nmr structural characterisation of a bimolecular anti parallel dna quadruplex d g acgtagtg  containing an autonomously stable mini hairpin motif inserted within the diagonal loop a folding topology is identified that is different from that observed for the analogous d g t g  dimer with the two structures differing in the relative orientation of the diagonal loops this appears to reflect specific base stacking interactions at the quadruplex  duplex interface that are not present in the structure with the t loop sequence a truncated version of the bimolecular quadruplex d g acgtagtg   with only two core g tetrads is less stable and forms a heterogeneous mixture of three  fold symmetric quadruplexes with different loop arrangements we demonstrate that the nature of the loop sequence its ability to form autonomously stable structure the relative stabilities of the hairpin loop and core quadruplex and the ability to form favourable stacking interactions between these two motifs are important factors in controlling dna g quadruplex topology
