identification of a novel human islet amyloid polypeptide  sheet domain and factors influencing fibrillogenesis edited by f e cohen
human islet amyloid polypeptide hiapp accumulates as pancreatic amyloid in type  diabetes and readily forms fibrils in vitro investigations into the mechanism of hiapp fibril formation have focused largely on residues  to   which are considered to comprise a primary amyloidogenic domain in rodents proline substitutions within this region and the subsequent  sheet disruption prevents fibril formation an additional amyloidogenic fragment within the c terminal sequence residues  to   has been identified recently we have extended these observations by examining a series of overlapping peptide fragments from the human and rodent sequences using protein spectroscopy cd ftir  electron microscopy and x ray diffraction a previously unrecognised amyloidogenic domain was localised within residues  to   synthetic peptides corresponding to this region exhibited a transition from random coil to  sheet conformation and assembled into fibrils having a typical amyloid like morphology the comparable rat   sequence which contains a single his arg substitution was also capable of assembling into amyloid like fibrils examination of peptide fragments corresponding to residues  to  revealed that the immediate n terminal region is likely to have only a modulating influence on fibril formation or conformational conversion the contributions of charged residues as they relate to the amyloid forming   sequence were also investigated using iapp fragments and by assessing the effects of ph and counterions the identification of these principal amyloidogenic sequences and the effects of associated factors provide details on the iapp aggregation pathway and structure of the peptide in its fibrillar state
