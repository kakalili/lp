e coli gyrase fails to negatively supercoil diaminopurine substituted dna
type ii topoisomerases modify dna supercoiling and crystal structures suggest that they sharply bend dna in the process bacterial gyrases are a class of type ii topoisomerases that can introduce negative supercoiling by creating a wrap of dna before strand passage isoforms of these essential enzymes were compared to reveal whether they can bend or wrap artificially stiffened dna escherichia coli gyrase and human topoisomerase ii  were challenged with normal dna or stiffer dna produced by polymerase chain reaction reactions in which diaminopurine dap replaced adenine deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates on single dna molecules twisted with magnetic tweezers to create plectonemes the rates or pauses during relaxation of positive supercoils in dap substituted versus normal dna were distinct for both enzymes gyrase struggled to bend or perhaps open a gap in dap substituted dna and segments of wider dap dna may have fit poorly into the n gate of the human topoisomerase ii  pauses during processive activity on both types of dna exhibited atp dependence consistent with two pathways leading to the strand passage competent state with a bent gate segment and a transfer segment trapped by an atp loaded and latched n gate however e coli dna gyrase essentially failed to negatively supercoil   stiffer dap dna
