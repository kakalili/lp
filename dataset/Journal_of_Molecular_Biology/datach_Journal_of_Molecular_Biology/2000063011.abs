characterization of loose and tight dimer forms of avian leukosis virus rna edited by j karn
retroviral genomes consist of two identical rna molecules joined non covalently near their   ends recently we showed that an imperfect autocomplementary sequence located in the l domain plays an essential role in avian sarcoma leukosis virus aslv rna dimerization in vitro this sequence can adopt a stem loop structure and is involved in aslv replication here we found that in the absence of nucleocapsid protein rna transcripts of avian leukosis virus alv were able to form two types of dimers in vitro that differ in their stability a loose dimer formed at a physiological temperature and a tight dimer formed at a high temperature a mutational analysis was performed to define the features of these dimers the results of this analysis unambiguously confirm that the two l stem loops interact directly in both types of dimers a loop loop interaction is the main linkage in the loose dimer in contrast in the tight dimer the stem and the loop of the l hairpin form an extended duplex surprisingly we also found that the dimerization properties defined for our alv strain type sr a differ from those found in other aslv strains
