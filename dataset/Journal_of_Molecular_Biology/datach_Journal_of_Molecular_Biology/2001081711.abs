xafs study of the high affinity copper binding site of human prp     and its low resolution structure in solution edited by i a wilson
here we describe the structure of a c terminal high affinity copper binding site within a truncated recombinant human prp containing residues      which lacks the octapeptide repeat region we show that at least two extra co ordinating groups are involved in binding this copper ii ion in conjunction with histidine residues  and   in a region of the molecule known to be critical in conferring strain type in addition using x ray solution scattering a low resolution shape of prp     is provided the restored molecular envelope is consistent with the picture where the n terminal segment residues      extends out from the previously known globular domain containing residues
