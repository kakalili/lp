macrophages secrete matrix metalloproteinase  covalently linked to the core protein of chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans
matrix metalloproteinases mmps secreted from the leukemic macrophage cell line thp  have been investigated under serum free conditions this cell line synthesizes and secretes prommp  which was detected in the culture medium as a monomer of  kda and in dimeric forms including a homodimer of approximately  kda in addition a new heterodimer complex is described in which prommp  is covalently linked to the core protein of chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan cspg through one or more disulphide bridges after sds page electrophoresis at least two forms of this complex were detected a large form in the stacking gel and a smaller form with an estimated size of  kda when the cs chains were removed by chondroitin abc lyase treatment heterodimers of prommp  cspg core protein of approximately     and  kda were found based on zymography and western blots since as much as    of the total prommp  secreted from thp  cells was covalently linked to cspg this association may have important implications for transport targetting and regulation of the enzyme activity
