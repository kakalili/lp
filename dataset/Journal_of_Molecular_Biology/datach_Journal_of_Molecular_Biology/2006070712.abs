a novel mechanism of interaction between  synuclein and biological membranes
conformational abnormalities and aggregation of  synuclein   syn have been linked to the pathogenesis of parkinson  s pd and related diseases it has been shown that  syn can stably bind artificial phospholipid vesicles through  helix formation in its n terminal repeat region however little is known about the membrane interaction in cells in the current study we determined the membrane binding properties of  syn to biological membranes by using bi functional chemical crosslinkers which allow the detection of transient but specific interactions by utilizing various point mutations and deletions within  syn we demonstrated that the membrane interaction of  syn in cells is also mediated by  helix formation in the n terminal repeat region moreover the pd linked a p mutation causes reduced membrane binding which is concordant with the artificial membrane studies however contrary to the interaction with artificial membranes the interaction with biological membranes is rapidly reversible and is not driven by electrostatic attraction furthermore the interaction of  syn with cellular membranes occurs only in the presence of non protein and non lipid cytosolic components which distinguishes it from the spontaneity of the interaction with artificial membranes more interestingly addition of the cytosolic preparation to artificial membranes resulted in the transient charge independent binding of  syn similar to the interaction with biological membranes these results suggest that in cells   syn is engaged in a fundamentally different mode of membrane interaction than the charge dependent artificial membrane binding and the mode of interaction is determined by the intrinsic properties of  syn itself and by the cytoplasmic context
