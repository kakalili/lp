oligomeric states of bacteriophage t gene  primase helicase
electron microscopic and crystallographic data have shown that the gene  primase helicase encoded by bacteriophage t can form both hexamers and heptamers after cross linking with glutaraldehyde to stabilize the oligomeric protein hexamers and heptamers can be distinguished either by negative stain electron microscopy or electrophoretic analysis using polyacrylamide gels we find that hexamers predominate in the presence of either dttp or    methylene dttp whereas the ratio between hexamers and heptamers is nearly the converse in the presence of dtdp when formed heptamers are unable to efficiently bind either single stranded dna or double stranded dna we postulate that a switch between heptamer to hexamer may provide a ring opening mechanism for the single stranded dna binding pathway accordingly we observe that in the presence of both nucleoside di and triphosphates the gene  protein exists as a hexamer when bound to single stranded dna and as a mixture of heptamer and hexamer when not bound to single stranded dna furthermore altering regions of the gene  protein postulated to be conformational switches for dttp dependent helicase activity leads to modulation of the heptamer to hexamer ratio
