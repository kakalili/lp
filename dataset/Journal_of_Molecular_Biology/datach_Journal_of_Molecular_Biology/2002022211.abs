crystallographic studies on human bst  cd  with adp ribosyl cyclase and nad glycohydrolase activities edited by r huber
cadpr is the novel second messenger that elicits calcium release from intracellular calcium stores and works independently of ip  in mammals the adp ribosyl cyclase function is found in two membrane proteins cd  and bst  cd   these enzymes exposed extracellularly bear cadpr hydrolase and nad glycohydrolase activities in spite of its functional importance the structural basis of these enzymatic reactions remains elusive we determined the crystal structures of the extracellular region of human bst  at atomic resolution in the free form and in complexes with five substrate analogues nicotinamide nmn atp s ethenonadp and ethenonad the three dimensional structural views of the reaction centre with these ligands revealed the mode of substrate binding and the catalytic mechanism of the multifunctional enzymatic reactions in each catalytic cleft of the dimeric enzyme substrates are recognized predominantly through van der waals interactions with two tryptophan residues and thereby the n glycosidic bond of nad is correctly exposed near a catalytic glutamate residue its carboxyl side chain stabilizes the catalytic intermediate of the sn  type reaction this conformation of the catalytic cleft also implies the mechanism of cyclization between the adenine base and the ribose the three key residues are invariant among the sequences of bst  cd  and aplysia cyclase and hence this substrate recognition mode and catalytic scheme appear to be common in the cyclase family
