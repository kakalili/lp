four genes encode acetylcholinesterases in the nematodes caenorhabditis elegans and caenorhabditis briggsae cdna sequences genomic structures mutations and in vivo expression
we report the full coding sequences and the genomic organization of the four genes encoding acetylcholinesterase ache in caenorhabditis elegans and caenorhabditis briggsae in relation to the properties of the encoded enzymes ace  and ace  located on chromosome x and i respectively encode two aches ace  and ace  that present   identity the c terminal end of ace  is homologous to the c terminus of t subunits of vertebrate aches ace  oligomerizes into amphiphilic tetramers ace  has a hydrophobic c terminus of h type it associates into glycolipid anchored dimers in c elegans and c briggsae ace  and ace  are organized in tandem on chromosome ii with only   nt and   nt respectively between the stop codon of ace  upstream gene and the atg of ace  ace  produces only  of the total ache activity it encodes an h subunit that associates into dimers of glycolipid anchored catalytic subunits which are highly resistant to the usual ache inhibitors and which hydrolyze butyrylthiocholine faster than acetylthiocholine ace  is closer to ace    identity than to ace  or ace  the usual sequence fgesag surrounding the active serine residue in cholinesterases is changed to fgqsag in ace  ace  was not detected by our current biochemical methods although the gene is transcribed in vivo however the level of ace  mrnas is far lower than those of ace  ace  and ace  the ace  ace  and ace  transcripts were found to be trans spliced by both sl and sl  although these genes are not included in typical operons the molecular bases of null mutations g  ace   p   and dc  ace  have been identified
