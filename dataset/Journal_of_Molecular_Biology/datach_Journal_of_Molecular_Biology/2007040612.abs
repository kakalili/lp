nmr dynamics distinguish between hard and soft hydrophobic cores in the dna binding domain of phob and demonstrate different roles of the cores in binding to dna
the transcription factor phob contains an n terminal regulatory domain and a c terminal dna binding transactivation domain the dna binding transactivation domain alone can bind specifically to dna and consequently activate transcription it consists of an n terminal four stranded  sheet and a winged helix domain containing a three helix bundle and a c terminal  hairpin the second and third helices together with the  hairpin contact dna and the loop between the second and third helices is responsible for the transactivation here we have examined the backbone and side chain dynamics of the dna binding domain in its dna free and bound forms by nmr the side chain dynamics identified two apparent hydrophobic cores one a soft hydrophobic core shows inherently flexible dynamics on the pico to nanosecond timescale and maintains the dna binding and transactivation surfaces the other is a hard hydrophobic core formed between the n terminal  sheet and the three helix bundle which maintains the other non functional surface upon binding to dna the flexibility of the soft core decreases but remains more flexible than the hard core the winged helix domain itself has inherent flexibility in the dna binding and transactivation functions however the back surface of both functional surfaces seems to be covered by the n terminal  sheet in order to mask a possible function arising from the inherent flexibility of the winged helix domain
