The complete 83,042 bp sequence of the circular naphthalene degradation plasmid pDTG1 from Pseudomonas putida strain NCIB 9816-4 was determined in order to examine the process by which the nah and sal operons may have been compiled and distributed in nature. Eighty-nine open reading frames were predicted using computer analyses, comprising 80.0% of the pDTG1 DNA sequence. The most distinctive feature of the plasmid is the upper and lower naphthalene degradation operons, which occupy 9.5 kb and 13.4 kb regions, respectively, bordered by numerous defective mobile genetic element fragments. Identified on this plasmid were homologues of genes required for large plasmid replication, maintenance, and conjugation, as well as transposases, resolvases, and integrases, suggesting an evolution that involved the lateral transfer of DNA between bacterial species. Also found were genes that contain a high degree of sequence similarity to other known degradation genes, as well as genes involved in chemotaxis. Although the incompatibility group designation of pDTG1 remains unresolved, striking sequence organization and homology exists between the plasmid backbones of pDTG1 and the IncP-9 toluene-degradation plasmid pWW0, which suggests a divergent evolution from a progenitor plasmid prior to degradative gene incorporation.
