dynamic allostery in the ring protein trap
we have discovered distinct characteristic differences in the thermodynamic signatures of tryptophan binding by trp rna binding attenuation protein trap from two different bacterial species the trap  mer ring binds  molecules of tryptophan at symmetry related sites tryptophan binding to bacillus stearothermophilus trap is not cooperative but isothermal titration calorimetry shows that filling the first tryptophan binding sites of bacillus subtilis trap has a marked effect on the thermodynamics of subsequent ligand binding we have identified a single conservative amino acid replacement ile to leu in b subtilis trap that abolishes this effect and suggest the initial ligand binding causes a change throughout the wild type protein ring
