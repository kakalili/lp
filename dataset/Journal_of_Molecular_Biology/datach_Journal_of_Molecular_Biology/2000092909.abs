modeling protein small molecule interactions structure and thermodynamics of noble gases binding in a cavity in mutant phage t lysozyme l a edited by b honig
the complexes of phage t lysozyme l a with noble gases have been studied by molecular dynamics simulation in a long simulation of the complex with one xe atom the structure was found to undergo global conformation change involving a reversible opening and closing of the entrance to the substrate binding site during which the conformations of the n and c terminal domains varied little the distributions of xe positions sampled in dynamics simulations were refined in terms of anisotropic gaussian distributions via least squares minimization of the difference between fourier transforms in addition molecular transformation simulations have been applied in order to calculate the binding free energies of xe kr and ar relative to a standard state at a pressure of  bar a single bound xe is found to assume an equilibrium distribution over three adjacent preferred sites while in a two xe complex the two xe atoms preferentially occupy two of these the positions of the three sites agree closely with the positions of bound xe determined in the refined crystal structure of a complex formed at a pressure of  bar xe and the calculated affinities agree well with the observed partial occupancies at a pressure of  bar a mixture of one xe and two xe complexes is present and similarly for complexes with kr and ar with single occupancy relatively more prevalent with kr and ar  binding of a third xe atom is found to be quite unfavorable  a comparison with simulation results for the binding of benzene to the same site leads to the conclusion that binding of xe within cavities in proteins is common because of several favorable factors   xe has a large atomic polarizability   xe can be applied at a relatively high pressure i e high chemical potential   an unfavorable entropic term related to the need to orient the ligand in the binding site is absent finally it is found that the model  s binding energy of a water molecule in the cavity is insufficient to overcome the unfavorable binding entropy
