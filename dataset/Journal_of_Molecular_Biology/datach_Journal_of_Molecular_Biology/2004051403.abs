a kinetic analysis of the nucleotide induced allosteric transitions in a single ring mutant of groel
the function of groe requires a complex system of allosteric communication driven by protein  nucleotide interactions these rearrangements couple the binding and hydrolysis of atp to an overall reaction cycle in which substrate proteins are bound encapsulated and released positive cooperativity with respect to atp binding occurs within one heptameric ring of groel while negative cooperativity between the two rings generates an inherent asymmetry between the two rings a previously engineered mutant of groel in which the ring  ring contacts are broken gives rise to a single ring version of the wild type chaperonin sr  we have studied the kinetics of the nucleotide induced conformational changes in a single tryptophan variant of sr  y  w sr  and compared the resulting data with those we reported previously for the double ring single tryptophan variant of wild type groel y  w groel  remarkably the parting of the rings does not have a major effect on the conformational changes occurring within the heptameric ring and a kinetic model is presented to describe the sequence of structural rearrangements that occur upon atp binding to the sr molecule the observation that both the atp induced and adp induced conformational rearrangements occur more rapidly in the sr than they do in wild type groel indicates that intra ring conformational changes in the double ring structure must overcome conformational constraints provided by the presence of the second ring lastly the data presented here imply a role for inter ring allostery in controlling the dissociation  association behaviour of the groes co protein in the overall reaction cycle
