cystoviral polymerase complex protein p uses its acidic c terminal tail to regulate the rna directed rna polymerase p
in bacteriophages of the cystovirus family the polymerase complex px encodes a  kda rna directed rna polymerase p  that transcribes the double stranded rna genome also a constituent of the px is the essential protein p that in addition to accelerating px assembly and facilitating genome packaging plays a regulatory role in transcription deletion of p from the px leads to aberrant plus strand synthesis suggesting its influence on the transcriptase activity of p  here using solution nmr techniques and the p and p proteins from cystovirus    we demonstrate their largely electrostatic interaction in vitro chemical shift perturbations on p in the presence of p suggest that this interaction involves the dynamic c terminal tail of p  more specifically an acidic cluster therein patterns of chemical shift changes induced on p by the p c terminus resemble those seen in the presence of single stranded rna suggesting similarities in binding this association between p and p reduces the affinity of the former toward template rna and results in its decreased activity both in de novo rna synthesis and in extending a short primer given the presence of c terminal acidic tracts on all cystoviral p proteins the electrostatic nature of the p p interaction is likely conserved within the family and could constitute a mechanism through which p regulates transcription in cystoviruses
