the amino terminal helix modulates light activated conformational changes in aslov
the mechanism of light triggered conformational change and signaling in light oxygen voltage lov domains remains elusive in spite of extensive investigation and their use in optogenetic studies the lov domain of avena sativa phototropin  aslov  a member of the per arnt sim pas family contains a flavin mononucleotide chromophore that forms a covalent bond with a cysteine upon illumination this event leads to the release of the carboxy terminal j  helix the biological output signal using mutational analysis circular dichroism and nmr we find that the largely ignored amino terminal helix is a control element in aslov s light activated conformational change we further identify a direct amino to carboxy terminal  input  output  signaling pathway these findings provide a framework to rationalize the lov domain architecture as well as the signaling mechanisms in both isolated and tandem arrangements of pas domains this knowledge can be applied in engineering lov based photoswitches opening up new design strategies and improving existing ones
