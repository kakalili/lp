structural investigations of calcium binding and its role in activity and activation of outer membrane phospholipase a from escherichia coli edited by i b holland
outer membrane phospholipase a ompla is an integral membrane enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of phospholipids enzymatic activity is regulated by reversible dimerisation and calcium binding we have investigated the role of calcium by x ray crystallography in monomeric ompla one calcium ion binds between two external loops l l site at    from the active site after dimerisation a new calcium binding site catalytic site is formed at the dimer interface in the active site of each molecule at   from the l l calcium site the close spacing and the difference in calcium affinity of both sites suggests that the l l site may function as a storage site for a calcium ion which relocates to the catalytic site upon dimerisation a sequence alignment demonstrates conservation of the catalytic calcium site but evolutionary variation of the l l site the residues in the dimer interface are conserved as well suggesting that all outer membrane phospholipases require dimerisation and calcium in the catalytic site for activity for this family of phospholipases we have characterised a consensus sequence motif ytq xn g x h x sng that contains conserved residues involved in dimerisation and catalysis
