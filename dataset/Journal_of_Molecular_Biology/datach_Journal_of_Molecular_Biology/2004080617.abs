localized nature of the transition state structure in goat  lactalbumin folding
to investigate whether the structure partially formed in the molten globule folding intermediate of goat  lactalbumin is further organized in the transition state of folding we constructed a number of mutant proteins and performed  value analysis on them for this purpose we measured the equilibrium unfolding transitions and kinetic refolding and unfolding reactions of the mutants using equilibrium and stopped flow kinetic circular dichroism techniques the results show that the mutants with mutations located in the a helix v a l a  the b helix v a  the  domain l a w a  the c helix k a l a  the c  d loop y  f  the d helix l  a l  a  and the c terminal   helix w  f  have low  values less than   on the other hand d n which is located on the ca  binding site has a high  value    indicating that tight packing of the side chain around asp  occurs in the transition state one  domain mutant i v and three c helix mutants i v v a and i v demonstrated intermediate  values between   and   these results indicate that the folding nucleus in the transition state of goat  la is not extensively distributed over the  domain of the protein but very localized in a region that contains the ca  binding site and the interface between the c helix and the  domain this is apparently in contrast with the fact that the molten globule state of  lactalbumin has a partially formed structure inside the  domain it is concluded that the specific docking of the  and  domains at a domain interface is necessary for this protein to organize its native structure from the molten globule intermediate
