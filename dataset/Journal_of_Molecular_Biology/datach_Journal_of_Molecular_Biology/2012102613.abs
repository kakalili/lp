the structure of myristoylated mason pfizer monkey virus matrix protein and the role of phosphatidylinositol    bisphosphate in its membrane binding
we determined the solution structure of myristoylated mason pfizer monkey virus matrix protein by nmr spectroscopy the myristoyl group is buried inside the protein and causes a slight reorientation of the helices this reorientation leads to the creation of a binding site for phosphatidylinositols the interaction between the matrix protein and phosphatidylinositols carrying c fatty acid chains was monitored by observation of concentration  dependent chemical shift changes of the affected amino acid residues a saturation transfer difference experiment and changes in  p chemical shifts no differences in the binding mode or affinity were observed with differently phosphorylated phosphatidylinositols the structure of the matrix protein  phosphatidylinositol    bisphosphate pi   p  complex was then calculated with haddock software based on the intermolecular nuclear overhauser enhancement contacts between the ligand and the matrix protein obtained from a  c filtered  c edited nuclear overhauser enhancement spectroscopy experiment pi   p binding was not strong enough for triggering of the myristoyl  switch the structural changes of the myristoylated matrix protein were also found to result in a drop in the oligomerization capacity of the protein
