competitive lrp and dam assembly at the pap regulatory region implications for mechanisms of epigenetic regulation
escherichia coli dna adenine methyltransferase dam and leucine responsive regulatory protein lrp are key regulators of the pap operon which codes for the pilus proteins necessary for uropathogenic e coli cellular adhesion the pap operon is regulated by a phase variation mechanism in which the methylation states of two gatc sites in the pap regulatory region and the binding position of lrp determine whether the pilus genes are expressed the post replicative reassembly of dam lrp and the local regulator papi onto a hemimethylated pap intermediate is a critical step of the phase variation switching mechanism and is not well understood we show that lrp in the presence and in the absence of papi and nonspecific dna specifically protects pap regulatory gatc sites from dam methylation when allowed to compete with dam for assembly on unmethylated and hemimethylated pap dna the methylation protection is dependent upon the concentration of lrp and does not occur with non regulatory gatc sites our data suggest that only at low lrp concentrations will dam compete effectively for binding and methylation of the proximal gatc site leading to a phase switch resulting in the expression of pili
