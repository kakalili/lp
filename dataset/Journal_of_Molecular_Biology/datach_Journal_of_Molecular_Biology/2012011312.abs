phosphorylated smooth muscle heavy meromyosin shows an open conformation linked to activation
smooth muscle myosin and smooth muscle heavy meromyosin smhmm are activated by regulatory light chain phosphorylation but the mechanism remains unclear dephosphorylated inactive smhmm assumes a closed conformation with asymmetric intramolecular head  head interactions between motor domains the  free head  can bind to actin but the actin binding interface of the  blocked head  is involved in interactions with the free head we report here a three dimensional structure for phosphorylated active smhmm obtained using electron crystallography of two dimensional arrays head  head interactions of phosphorylated smhmm resemble those found in the dephosphorylated state but occur between different molecules not within the same molecule the light chain binding domain structure of phosphorylated smhmm differs markedly from that of the  blocked  head of dephosphorylated smhmm we hypothesize that regulatory light chain phosphorylation opens the inhibited conformation primarily by its effect on the blocked head singly phosphorylated smhmm is not compatible with the closed conformation if the blocked head is phosphorylated this concept has implications for the extent of myosin activation at low levels of phosphorylation in smooth muscle
