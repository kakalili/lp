two divalent metal ions in the active site of a new crystal form of human apurinic apyrimidinic endonuclease ape  implications for the catalytic mechanism edited by i a wilson
the major human abasic endonuclease ape  is an essential dna repair enzyme that initiates the removal of apurinic apyrimidinic sites from dna excises   replication blocking moieties and modulates the dna binding activity of several transcriptional regulators we have determined the x ray structure of the full length human ape enzyme in two new crystal forms one at neutral and one at acidic ph the new structures are generally similar to the previously determined structure of a truncated ape protein but differ in the conformation of several loop regions and in spans of residues with weak electron density while only one active site metal ion is present in the structure determined at low ph the structure determined from a crystal grown at the ph optimum of ape nuclease activity ph   has two metal ions bound   apart in the active site enzyme kinetic data indicate that at least two metal binding sites are functionally important since ca  exhibits complex stimulatory and inhibitory effects on the mg  dependent catalysis of ape  even though ca  itself does not serve as a cofactor in conjunction the structural and kinetic data suggest that ape catalyzes hydrolysis of the dna backbone through a two metal ion mediated mechanism
