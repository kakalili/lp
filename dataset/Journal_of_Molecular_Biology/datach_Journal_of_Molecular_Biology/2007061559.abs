structural basis of dna recognition by the alternative sigma factor
the  subunit of bacterial rna polymerase rnap regulates gene expression by directing rnap to specific promoters unlike   type proteins the alternative  factor    requires interaction with an atpase to open dna we present the solution structure of the c terminal domain of   bound to the    promoter element in which the conserved rpon box motif inserts into the major groove of the dna this structure elucidates the basis for sequence specific recognition of the    element orients   on the promoter and suggests how the c terminal domain of   interacts with rnap
