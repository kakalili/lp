functional analysis of yeast bcs mutants highlights the role of bcs p specific amino acids in the aaa domain
the mitochondrial protein bcs p is conserved from saccharomyces cerevisiae to humans and its c terminal region exhibits an aaa atpases associated with diverse cellular activities domain the absence of the yeast bcs p leads to an assembly defect of the iron  sulfur protein isp subunit within the mitochondrial respiratory complex iii whereas human point mutations located all along the protein cause various pathologies we have performed a structure  function analysis of the yeast bcs p by randomly generating a collection of respiratory deficient point mutants we showed that most mutations are in the c terminal region of bcs p and have localized them on a theoretical three dimensional model based on the structure of several aaa proteins the mutations can be grouped into classes according to their respiratory competence and their location on the three dimensional model we have further characterized five mutants each substituting an amino acid conserved in yeast and mammalian bcs proteins but not in other aaa proteins the effects on respiratory complex assembly and bcs p accumulation were analyzed intragenic and extragenic compensatory mutations able to restore complex iii assembly to the mutants affecting the aaa domain were isolated our results bring new insights into the role of specific residues in critical regions that are also conserved in the human bcs p we show that   residues located at the junction between the bcs p specific and the aaa domains are important for the activity and stability of the protein and   the residue f  is important for interactions with other partners or substrate proteins
