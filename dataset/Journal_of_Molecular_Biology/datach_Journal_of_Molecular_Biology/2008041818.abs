molecular mechanism of p  mediated regulation of hepatitis b virus core promoter enhancer ii implications for hepatocarcinogenesis
hepatitis b virus hbv is a causative agent of chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma recent findings demonstrating p  and specifically n terminally truncated p   tap  accumulation in hepatocellular carcinoma suggest that p  plays a role in the malignant phenotype here we investigated the mechanism of hbv pregenomic core promoter enhancer ii cp eii regulation by full length tap  and its oncogenic counterpart  tap  ectopic and endogenous expression of tap  leads to a significant downregulation of cp eii activity in p  deficient hepatoma cell lines in contrast overexpression of  tap  results in significant cp eii activation and increased hbv core hbc expression tap  mediated repression of hbv transcription was substantially abolished by  tap  we show that both tap  and  tap  proteins directly bind to the sp transcription factor a key stimulator of hbv gene expression however only tap  abolishes sp binding to cp eii whereas the  tap   sp complex further persists on the dna the inhibitory effect of p  p  on hbc expression is associated with the inhibition of viral replication while  tap  is not these data strongly support the fact that the p  isoform related interaction with sp is the underlying mechanism of the diverse outcome on hbc expression suggesting a new mechanism by which oncogenic  tap  could enhance the carcinogenic process in liver cells
