alternative design of a trna core for aminoacylation edited by d draper
the core of escherichia coli trnacys is important for aminoacylation of the trna by cysteine trna synthetase this core differs from the common trna core by having a g  g  rather than a g  c  base pair substitution of g  g  with g  c  decreases the catalytic efficiency of aminoacylation by two orders of magnitude this indicates that the design of the core is not compatible with g  c  however the core of e coli trnagln which contains g  c  is functional for cysteine trna synthetase here guided by the core of e coli trnagln we sought to test and identify alternative functional design of the trnacys core that contains g  c  although analysis of the crystal structure of trnacys and trnagln implicated long range tertiary base pairs above and below g  g  as important for a functional core we showed that this was not the case the replacement of tertiary interactions involving    and  in trnacys with those in trnagln did not construct a functional core that contained g  c  in contrast substitution of nucleotides in the variable loop adjacent to  of the    base pair created functional cores modeling studies of a functional core suggests that the re constructed core arose from enhanced stacking interactions that compensated for the disruption caused by the g  c  base pair the repacked trna core displayed features that were distinct from those of the wild type and provided evidence that stacking interactions are alternative means than long range tertiary base pairs to a functional core for aminoacylation
