inverting enantioselectivity of burkholderia cepacia kwi  lipase by combinatorial mutation and high throughput screening using single molecule pcr and in vitro expression
the enantioselectivity of lipase from burkhorderia cepacia kwi  has been inverted using a novel in vitro technique for construction and screening of a protein library by single molecule dna amplification by pcr followed by in vitro coupled transcription translation system termed single molecule pcr linked in vitro expression simplex  four amino acid residues l  f   l   and l   in the hydrophobic substrate binding pocket of the lipase were selected for mutation based on a structural model of a substrate  enzyme complex and a combinatorial mutation library was constructed by simplex and screened for r and s configurations of p nitrophenyl  phenylbutyrate some combinations of amino acid substitutions in the four positions of the lipase were found as effective for changing the enantiopreference from the s form substrate to the r form two variants were expressed in the original host cells and purified to homogeneity showing completely reversed enantioselectivity for the r form of ethyl  phenylbutyrate selectivity factor er  or   whereas the wild type lipase was s selective selectivity factor es   thus the semi rational and semi random combinatorial design of a mutant library followed by a high throughput screening based on their enzymatic activity should be a powerful tool to engineer the enantioselectivity of enzymes
