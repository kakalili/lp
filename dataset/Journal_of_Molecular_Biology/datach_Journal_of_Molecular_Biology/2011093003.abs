the staphylococcus aureus pathogenicity island  protein gp functions as an internal scaffold during capsid size determination
staphylococcus aureus pathogenicity island  sapi  is a mobile genetic element that carries genes for several superantigen toxins sapi is normally stably integrated into the host genome but can become mobilized by  helper  bacteriophage    leading to the packaging of sapi genomes into phage like transducing particles that are composed of structural proteins supplied by the helper phage but having smaller capsids we show that the sapi encoded protein gp is necessary for efficient formation of small capsids the nmr structure of gp reveals a dimeric protein with a helix  loop  helix motif similar to that of bacteriophage scaffolding proteins the gp dimer matches internal densities that bridge capsid subunits in cryo electron microscopy reconstructions of sapi procapsids suggesting that gp acts as an internal scaffolding protein in capsid size determination
