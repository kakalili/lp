mechanisms for ligand binding to glur ion channels crystal structures of the glutamate and serine complexes and a closed apo state edited by d rees
high resolution structures of the ligand binding core of glur  a glutamate receptor ion channel from synechocystis pcc    have been solved by x ray diffraction the glur structures reveal homology with bacterial periplasmic binding proteins and the rat glur ampa subtype neurotransmitter receptor the ligand binding site is formed by a cleft between two globular    domains l glutamate binds in an extended conformation similar to that observed for glutamine binding protein glnbp  however the l glutamate  carboxyl group interacts exclusively with asn  in domain  different from the interactions of ligand with domain  residues observed for glur and glnbp to address how neutral amino acids activate glur gating we solved the structure of the binding site complex with l serine this revealed solvent molecules acting as surrogate ligand atoms such that the serine oh group makes solvent mediated hydrogen bonds with asn  the structure of a ligand free closed cleft conformation revealed an extensive hydrogen bond network mediated by solvent molecules equilibrium centrifugation analysis revealed dimerization of the glur ligand binding core with a dissociation constant of    m in the crystal a symmetrical dimer involving residues in domain  occurs along a crystallographic  fold axis and suggests that tetrameric glutamate receptor ion channels are assembled from dimers of dimers we propose that ligand induced conformational changes cause the ion channel to open as a result of an increase in domain  separation relative to the dimer interface
