regulation of saccharomyces cerevisiae fet by oxygen and iron
saccharomyces cerevisiae expresses two distinct iron transport systems under aerobic and anaerobic conditions the high affinity transporters ftr p and fet p are primarily expressed in oxygenated cultures whereas anaerobic conditions induce the low affinity iron transporter fet p the oxygen regulation of fet was found to involve the rox p transcriptional repressor the physiological significance of this control by rox p is twofold first fet repression by rox p under oxygenated conditions helps minimize metal toxicity sensitivity towards cadmium was high in either anaerobically grown wild type yeast or in oxygenated rox  strains and in both cases cadmium toxicity was reversed by fet mutations secondly the loss of rox p repression under anaerobic conditions serves to induce fet and facilitate continual accumulation of iron we noted that fet mutants accumulate lower levels of iron under anaerobic conditions regulation of fet was examined using fet lacz reporters we found that fet contains a complex promoter regulated both by oxygen and iron status the region surrounding      to    contains two consensus rox p binding sites and mediates rox p but not iron control of fet  sequences downstream of    harbor a consensus binding site for the iron regulatory factor aft p that is essential for iron regulation in wild type strains in addition a secondary mode of iron regulation becomes evident in strains lacking aft  the induction by iron limitation in conjunction with low oxygen is more than additive suggesting that these activities are synergistic fet p is not the only metal transporter that is negatively regulated by oxygen we find that rox p also represses s cerevisiae smf  proposed to function in vacuolar iron transport this oxygen control of iron transporter gene expression is part of an adaptation response to changes in the redox state of transition metals
