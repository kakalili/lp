inhibition of hhai dna cytosine c  methyltransferase by oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing  aza   deoxycytidine examination of the intertwined roles of co factor target transition state structure and enzyme conformation
the presence of  azacytosine zcyt residues in dna leads to potent inhibition of dna cytosine c  methyltranferases c mtases in vivo and in vitro enzymatic methylation of cytosine in mammalian dna is an epigenetic modification that can alter gene activity and chromosomal stability influencing both differentiation and tumorigenesis thus it is important to understand the critical mechanistic determinants of zcyt s inhibitory action although several dna c mtases have been reported to undergo essentially irreversible binding to zcyt in dna there is little agreement as to the role of adomet and or methyl transfer in stabilizing enzyme interactions with zcyt our results demonstrate that formation of stable complexes between hhai methyltransferase m hhai and oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing zcyt at the target position for methylation zcyt odns occurs in both the absence and presence of co factors adomet and adohcy both binary and ternary complexes survive sds page under reducing conditions and take on a compact conformation that increases their electrophoretic mobility in comparison to free m hhai since methyl transfer can occur only in the presence of adomet these results suggest   that the inhibitory capacity of zcyt in dna is based on its ability to induce a stable tightly closed conformation of m hhai that prevents dna and co factor release and   that methylation of zcyt in dna is not required for inhibition of m hhai
