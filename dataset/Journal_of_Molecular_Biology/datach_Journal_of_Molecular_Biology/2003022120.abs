solvation effects and driving forces for protein thermodynamic and kinetic cooperativity how adequate is native centric topological modeling
what energetic and solvation effects underlie the remarkable two state thermodynamics and folding unfolding kinetics of small single domain proteins to address this question we investigate the folding and unfolding of a hierarchy of continuum langevin dynamics models of chymotrypsin inhibitor  we find that residue based additive g  like contact energies although native centric are by themselves insufficient for protein like calorimetric two state cooperativity further native biases by local conformational preferences are necessary for protein like thermodynamics kinetically however even models with both contact and local native centric energies do not produce simple two state chevron plots thus a model protein s thermodynamic cooperativity is not sufficient for simple two state kinetics the models tested appear to have increasing internal friction with increasing native stability leading to chevron rollovers that typify kinetics that are commonly referred to as non two state the free energy profiles of these models are found to be sensitive to the choice of native contacts and the presumed spatial ranges of the contact interactions motivated by explicit water considerations we explore recent treatments of solvent granularity that incorporate desolvation free energy barriers into effective implicit solvent intraprotein interactions this additional feature reduces both folding and unfolding rates vis  vis that of the corresponding models without desolvation barriers but the kinetics remain non two state taken together our observations suggest that interaction mechanisms more intricate than simple g  like constructs and pairwise additive solvation like contributions are needed to rationalize some of the most basic generic protein properties therefore as experimental constraints on protein chain models requiring a consistent account of protein like thermodynamic and kinetic cooperativity can be more stringent and productive for some applications than simply requiring a model heteropolymer to fold to a target structure
