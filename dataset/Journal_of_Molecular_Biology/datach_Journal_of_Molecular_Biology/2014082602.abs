functional evolution of ribonuclease inhibitor insights from birds and reptiles
ribonuclease inhibitor ri is a conserved protein of the mammalian cytosol ri binds with high affinity to diverse secretory ribonucleases rnases and inhibits their enzymatic activity although secretory rnases are found in all vertebrates the existence of a non mammalian ri has been uncertain here we report on the identification and characterization of ri homologs from chicken and anole lizard these proteins bind to rnases from multiple species but exhibit much greater affinity for their cognate rnases than for mammalian rnases to reveal the basis for this differential affinity we determined the crystal structure of mouse bovine and chicken ri rnase complexes to a resolution of       and     respectively a combination of structural computational and bioinformatic analyses enabled the identification of two residues that appear to contribute to the differential affinity for rnases we also found marked differences in oxidative instability between mammalian and non mammalian ris indicating evolution toward greater oxygen sensitivity in ris from mammalian species taken together our results illuminate the structural and functional evolution of ri along with its dynamic role in vertebrate biology
