characterization and mapping of dna damage induced by reactive metabolites of  methylnitrosamino    pyridyl  butanone nnk at nucleotide resolution in human genomic dna edited by i tinoco
the nitrosamine  methylnitrosamino    pyridyl  butanone nnk is an important tobacco specific carcinogen associated with lung cancer its complex enzymatic activation leading to methyl and pyridyloxobutyl pob modified dna makes dna damage difficult to characterize and quantify therefore we use the nnk analogue   acetoxymethyl nitrosamino    pyridyl  butanone nnkoac to induce damage in genomic dna and to map the sites and frequency of adducts at nucleotide resolution using ligation mediated polymerase chain reaction and terminal transferase dependent polymerase chain reactions lmpcr and tdpcr  nnkoac induced single strand breaks in a concentration dependent manner post alkylation treatments including hot piperidine or digestion with the enzymes escherichia coli  methyladenine dna glycosylase ii formamidopyrimidine dna glycosylase escherichia coli endonuclease iii or phage t uv endonuclease v did not increase the level of dna breaks in nnkoac treated dna detection of dna damage using lmpcr was possible only when pob dna was   phosphorylated prior to the lmpcr procedure nnkoac generated damage at all four bases with the decreasing order guanine gt adenine gt cytosine gt thymine in contrast to nnkoac damage distribution patterns those induced by n nitroso acetoxymethyl methylamine a methylating nnk analog induced damage principally at g positions detectable by enzymatic means that did not require phosphorylation analysis of damage distribution patterns reveals a high frequency of damage in the p  gene in codons   and   and a lower frequency of damage in codon   we analyzed the   termini of the nnkoac induced single strand breaks using a  p post labeling assay or a nucleotide exchange reaction at the   termini catalyzed by t dna polymerase combined with endonuclease iv treatment both methods indicate that the   termini of the single strand breaks are not hydroxyl groups and are blocked by an unknown chemical structure that is not recognized by endonuclease iv these data are consistent with pob phosphotriester hydrolysis leading to strand breaks in dna the pob damage could be mutagenic because nnkoac produces single strand breaks with the products being a   hydroxyl group and a   blocking group and strand breaks these results represent the first step in determining if nnk pyridyloxobutylates dna with sequence specificity similar to those observed with other model compounds
