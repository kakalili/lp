crystallographic analysis of the primary photochemical reaction of squid rhodopsin
visual signal transduction is initiated by the photoisomerization of  cis retinal upon rhodopsin ligation unlike vertebrate rhodopsin which interacts with gt type g protein to stimulate the cyclic gmp signaling pathway invertebrate rhodopsin interacts with gq type g protein to stimulate a signaling pathway that is based on inositol    triphosphate since the inositol    triphosphate signaling pathway is utilized by mammalian nonvisual pigments and a large number of g protein coupled receptors it is important to elucidate how the activation mechanism of invertebrate rhodopsin differs from that of vertebrate rhodopsin previous crystallographic studies of squid and bovine rhodopsins have shown that there is a profound difference in the structures of the retinal binding pockets of these photoreceptors here we report the crystal structures of all trans bathorhodopsin batho the first photoreaction intermediate and the artificial  cis isorhodopsin iso of squid rhodopsin upon the formation of batho the central moiety of the retinal was observed to move largely towards the cytoplasmic side while the schiff base and the ionone ring underwent limited movements i e  the all trans retinal in batho took on a right handed screwed configuration  conversely the  cis retinal in iso took on a planar configuration our results suggest that the light energy absorbed by squid rhodopsin is mostly converted into the distortion energy of the retinal polyene chain and surrounding residues
