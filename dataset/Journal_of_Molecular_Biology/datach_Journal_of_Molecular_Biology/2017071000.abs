a survey of ddx  activity during rev rre complex formation
hiv  requires a specialized nuclear export pathway to transport unspliced and partially spliced viral transcripts to the cytoplasm central to this pathway is the viral protein rev which binds to the rev response element in stem iib located on unspliced viral transcripts and subsequently oligomerizes in a cooperative manner previous work identified a number of cellular dead box helicases as in vivo binding partners of rev and sirna experiments indicated a functional role for many in the hiv replication cycle two dead box proteins ddx and ddx  had previously been shown to play a role in hiv pathogenesis in this study another protein identified in that screen ddx  is tested for protein and rna binding and subsequent enzymatic activities in the context of the rev rre pathway we found that ddx  can bind to the rre with high affinity and this binding stimulates atpase activity with an enzymatic efficiency similar to ddx  furthermore ddx  is both an atp dependent and atp independent helicase and both atpase and atp dependent helicase activities are inhibited by rev in a dose dependent manner although atp independent helicase activity is not a conserved binding interaction between ddx protein s dead domain and rev was identified with rev s nuclear diffusion inhibitory signal motif playing a significant role in binding finally ddx  was shown to enhance rev binding to the rre in a manner similar to that previously described for ddx  although ddx does not these data indicate that ddx and ddx  have similar biochemical activities with regard to the rev rre system while ddx differs
