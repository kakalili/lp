recognition elements in rrna for the tylosin resistance methyltransferase rlmaii
the methyltransferase rlmaii formerly tlrb is found in many gram positive bacteria and methylates the n  position of nucleotide g  within the loop of hairpin  in  s rrna methylation of the rrna by rlmaii confers resistance to tylosin and other mycinosylated  membered ring macrolide antibiotics we have previously solved the solution structure of hairpin  in the conformation that is recognized by the rlmaii methyltransferase from streptococcus pneumoniae it was shown that while essential recognition elements are located in hairpin   the interactions between rlmaii and hairpin  are insufficient on their own to support the methylation reaction here we use biochemical techniques in conjunction with heteronuclear homonuclear nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to define the rna structures that are required for efficient methylation by rlmaii progressive truncation of the rrna substrate indicated that multiple contacts occur between rlmaii and nucleotides in stem  loops    and   rlmaii appears to recognize its rrna target through specific surface shape complementarity at the junction formed by these three helices this means of recognition is highly similar to that of the orthologous gram negative methyltransferase rlmai formerly rrma  which also interacts with hairpin   but methylates at the adjacent nucleotide g
