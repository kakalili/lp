the crystal structure of d glyceraldehyde  phosphate dehydrogenase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon methanothermus fervidus in the presence of nadp at    resolution edited by r huber
the crystal structure of the glyceraldehyde  phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh from the archaeon methanothermus fervidus has been solved in the holo form at    resolution by molecular replacement unlike bacterial and eukaryotic homologous enzymes which are strictly nad dependent gapdh from this organism exhibits a dual cofactor specificity with a marked preference for nadp over nad  the present structure is the first archaeal gapdh crystallized with nadp  gapdh from m fervidus adopts a homotetrameric quaternary structure which is topologically similar to that observed for its bacterial and eukaryotic counterparts within the cofactor binding site the positively charged side chain of lys  decisively contributes to nadp recognition through a tight electrostatic interaction with the adenosine   phosphate group like other gapdhs gapdh from archaeal sources binds the nicotinamide moiety of nadp in a syn conformation with respect to the adjacent ribose and so belongs to the b stereospecific class of oxidoreductases stabilization of the syn conformation is principally achieved through hydrogen bonding of the carboxamide group with the side chain of asp   a structural feature clearly different from what is observed in all presently known gapdhs from bacteria and eukaryotes within the catalytic site the reported crystal structure definitively confirms the essential role previously assigned to cys  by site directed mutagenesis studies in conjunction with new mutation results reported in this paper inspection of the crystal structure gives reliable evidence for the direct implication of the side chain of his  in the catalytic mechanism m fervidus grows optimally at   c with a maximal growth temperature of   c the paper includes a detailed comparison of the present structure with four other homologous enzymes extracted from mesophilic as well as thermophilic organisms among the various phenomena related to protein thermostabilization reinforcement of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions as well as a more efficient molecular packing appear to be essentially promoted by the occurrence of two additional  helices in the archaeal gapdhs the first one named   is located in the catalytic domain and participates in the enzyme architecture at the quaternary structural level the second one named  j occurs at the c terminus and contributes to the molecular packing within each monomer by filling a peripherical pocket in the tetrameric assembly
