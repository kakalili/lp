crystal structure of bacillus subtilis signal peptide peptidase a
signal peptide peptidase a sppa is a membrane bound self compartmentalized serine protease that functions to cleave the remnant signal peptides left behind after protein secretion and cleavage by signal peptidases sppa is found in plants archaea and bacteria here we report the first crystal structure of a gram positive bacterial sppa the    resolution structure of bacillus subtilis sppa sppabs catalytic domain reveals eight sppabs molecules in the asymmetric unit forming a dome shaped octameric complex the octameric state of sppabs is supported by analytical size exclusion chromatography and multi angle light scattering analysis our sequence analysis mutagenesis and activity assays are consistent with ser  serving as the nucleophile and lys  serving as the general base however they are located in different region of the protein more than    apart only upon assembling the octamer do the serine and lysine come within close proximity with neighboring protomers each providing one half of the catalytic dyad thus producing eight separate active sites within the complex twice the number seen within escherichia coli sppa sppaec  the sppabs s substrate specificity pocket is deep narrow and hydrophobic but with a polar bottom the s pocket which is constructed from two neighboring proteins is shallower wider and more polar than the s pocket a comparison of these pockets to those seen in sppaec reveals a significant difference in the size and shape of the s pocket which we show is reflected in the repertoire of peptides the enzymes are capable of cleaving
