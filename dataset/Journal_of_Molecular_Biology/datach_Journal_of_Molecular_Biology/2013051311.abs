allosteric effects in the regulation of  s proteasome activities
the  s proteasome is the executive arm of the ubiquitin proteasome system this   mda complex comprising the  s core particle cp and the  s regulatory particle rp is able to effectively execute its function due to a tightly regulated network of allosteric interactions from this perspective we summarize the current state of knowledge on these regulatory interdependencies we classify them into the three functional layers  within the cp within the rp and at the cp  rp interface in the cp allosteric effects are thought to couple the gate opening and substrate proteolysis gate opening depends on events occurring in the rp  atp hydrolysis and substrate binding finally a number of processes occurring solely in the rp like atp hydrolysis or substrate deubiquitylation are also proposed to be allosterically regulated recent advances in structural studies of  s proteasome open up new avenues for dissecting and rationalizing the molecular basis of these regulatory networks
