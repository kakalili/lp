ca  causes release of myosin heads from the thick filament surface on the milliseconds time scale
we have used electron microscopy to study the structural changes induced when myosin filaments are activated by ca  negative staining reveals that when ca  binds to the heads of relaxed ca  regulated myosin filaments the helically ordered myosin heads become disordered and project further from the filament surface cryo electron microscopy of unstained frozen hydrated specimens supports this finding and shows that disordering is reversible on removal of ca  the structural change is thus a result of ca  binding alone and not an artifact of staining comparison of the two techniques suggests that negative staining preserves the structure induced by ca  binding we therefore used a time resolved negative staining technique to determine the time scale of the structural change full disordering was observed within  ms of ca  addition and had started to occur within  ms showing that the change occurs on the physiological time scale comparison with studies of single heavy meromyosin molecules suggests that an increased mobility of myosin heads induced by ca  binding underlies the changes in filament structure that we observe we conclude that the loosening of the array of myosin heads that occurs on activation is real and physiological it may function to make activated myosin heads freer to contact actin filaments during muscle contraction
