diffusional barrier in the unfolding of a small protein
to determine how the dynamics of the polypeptide chain in a protein molecule are coupled to the bulk solvent viscosity the unfolding by urea of the small protein barstar was studied in the presence of two viscogens xylose and glycerol thermodynamic studies of unfolding show that both viscogens stabilize barstar by a preferential hydration mechanism and that viscogen and urea act independently on protein stability kinetic studies of unfolding show that while the rate limiting conformational change during unfolding is dependent on the bulk solvent viscosity   its rate does not show an inverse dependence on   as expected by kramers theory instead the rate is found to be inversely proportional to an effective viscosity      where  is an adjustable parameter which needs to be included in the rate equation   is found to have a value of    cp in xylose and    cp in glycerol in the case of unfolding at constant urea concentration as well as under isostability conditions hence the unfolding protein chain does not experience the bulk solvent viscosity but instead an effective solvent viscosity which is lower than the bulk solvent viscosity by either   cp or   cp a second important result is the validation of the isostability assumption commonly used in protein folding studies but hitherto untested according to which if a certain concentration of urea can nullify the effect of a certain concentration of viscogen on stability then the same concentrations of urea and viscogen will also not perturb the free energy of activation of the unfolding of the protein
