from dusk till dawn one plasmid systems for light regulated gene expression
signaling photoreceptors mediate diverse organismal adaptations in response to light as light gated protein switches signaling photoreceptors provide the basis for optogenetics a term that refers to the control of organismal physiology and behavior by light we establish as novel optogenetic tools the plasmids pdusk and pdawn which employ blue light photoreceptors to confer light repressed or light induced gene expression in escherichia coli with up to   fold induction upon illumination key features of these systems are low background activity high dynamic range spatial control on the   m scale independence from exogenous factors and ease of use in optogenetic experiments pdusk and pdawn can be used to specifically perturb individual nodes of signaling networks and interrogate their role on the preparative scale pdawn can induce by light the production of recombinant proteins and thus represents a cost effective and readily automated alternative to conventional induction systems
