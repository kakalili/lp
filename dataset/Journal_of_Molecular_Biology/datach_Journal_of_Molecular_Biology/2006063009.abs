x ray crystal structures of rabbit n acetylglucosaminyltransferase i gnt i in complex with donor substrate analogues
the golgi resident glycosyltransferase udp n acetyl d glucosamine   d mannoside    n acetylglucosaminyltransferase i gnt i  initiates the conversion of high mannose oligosaccharides to complex and hybrid structures in the biosynthesis of n linked glycans reported here are the x ray crystal structures of gnt i in complex with udp ch glcnac a non hydrolyzable c glycosidic phosphonate  udp  deoxy  fluoro glucose udp glucose and udp collectively these structures provide evidence for the importance of the glcnac moiety and its n acetyl group in donor substrate binding as well as insight into the role played by the flexible     loop in substrate binding and product release in addition the udp ch glcnac complex reveals a well defined glycerol molecule poised for nucleophilic attack on the c atom of the donor substrate analogue the position and orientation of this glycerol molecule have allowed us to model the binding of the man   man  moiety of the acceptor substrate and based on the model to suggest a rationalization for the main determinants of gnt i acceptor specificity
