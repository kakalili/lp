engineering and structural characterization of a linear polyubiquitin specific antibody
polyubiquitination is an essential posttranslational modification that plays critical roles in cellular signaling polyub polyubiquitin chains are formed by linking the carboxyl terminus of one ub ubiquitin subunit to either a lysine residue or the amino terminus of an adjacent ub linkage through the amino terminus results in linear polyubiquitination that has recently been demonstrated to be a key step in nuclear factor  b activation however tools to study linear chains have been lacking we therefore engineered a linear linkage specific antibody that is functional in western blot immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence applications a crystal structure of the linear linkage specific antibody fab fragment in complex with linear diubiquitin provides molecular insight into the nature of linear chain specificity we use the antibody to demonstrate that linear polyub is up regulated upon tumor necrosis factor  stimulation of cells consistent with a critical role in nuclear factor  b signaling this antibody provides an essential tool for further investigation of the function of linear chains
