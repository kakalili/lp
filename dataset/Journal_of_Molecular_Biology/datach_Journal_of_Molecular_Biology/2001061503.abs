folding of  sheets in membranes specificity and promiscuity in peptide model systems edited by g von heijne
the interactions that drive the folding of  barrel membrane proteins have not been well studied because there have been few available model systems for membrane  sheets in this work we expand on a recently described model system to explore the contributions of interstrand hydrogen bonds side chain side chain interactions and side chain membrane interactions to  sheet formation in membranes these experiments are based on the observation that the hydrophobic hexapeptide acetyl trp leu leu leu leu leu oh acwlllll folds cooperatively and reversibly into oligomeric antiparallel  sheets in phosphatidylcholine membranes to systematically characterize the important interactions that drive  sheet formation in membranes we have used circular dichroism spectroscopy to determine the membrane secondary structure of each member of a complete host guest family of related peptides of the form acwll x ll where x is one of the natural amino acids peptides with hydrophobic x residues of any size or character x  ala val ile leu cys met phe and trp form similar  sheets in membranes while peptides with any polar x residue or gly or pro at the x position are random coils even when bound to membranes at high concentrations the observed membrane sheet preferences correlate poorly with intrinsic sheet propensity scales measured in soluble proteins but they correlate well with several membrane hydrophobicity scales these results support the idea that the predominant interactions of the side chains in membrane bound  sheets are with the membrane lipids and that backbone hydrogen bonding is the major driving force for the stabilization of  sheets in membranes
