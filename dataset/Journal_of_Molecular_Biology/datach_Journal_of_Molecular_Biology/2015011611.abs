tmem  proteins unknown structure and confusing functions
the tmem  family of membrane proteins also known as anoctamins plays key roles in a variety of physiological functions that range from ion transport to phospholipid scrambling and to regulating other ion channels the first two family members to be functionally characterized tmem a ano  and tmem b ano  form ca  activated cl  channels and are important for transepithelial ion transport olfaction phototransduction smooth muscle contraction nociception cell proliferation and control of neuronal excitability the roles of other family members such as tmem c ano  tmem d ano  tmem f ano  tmem g ano  and tmem j ano  remain poorly understood and controversial these homologues were reported to be phospholipid scramblases ion channels to have both functions or to be regulatory subunits of other channels mutations in tmem f cause scott syndrome a bleeding disorder caused by impaired ca  dependent externalization of phosphatidylserine in activated platelets suggesting that this homologue might be a scramblase however overexpression of tmem f has also been associated with a remarkable number of different ion channel types raising the possibility that this protein might be involved in both ion and lipid transports the recent identification of an ancestral tmem  homologue with intrinsic channel and scramblase activities supports this hypothesis thus the tmem  family might have diverged in two or three different subclasses channels scramblases and dual function channel scramblases the structural bases and functional implication of such a functional diversity within a single protein family remain to be elucidated and the links between tmem  functions and human physiology and pathologies need to be investigated
