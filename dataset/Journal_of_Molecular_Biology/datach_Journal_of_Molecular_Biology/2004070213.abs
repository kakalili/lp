physical evidence for the induced release of the bacillus subtilis transcription factor  f from its inhibitory complex
the release of the transcription factor  f from its inhibitory complex with spoiiab is a key regulatory step in the control of sporulation in bacillus subtilis as it initiates a pattern of differential gene expression in the mother cell and prespore compartments the  f spoiiab complex is dissociated by the unphosphorylated form of the protein spoiiaa the alternative binding partner of spoiiab here we employ fluorescence spectroscopy to examine the mechanism by which spoiiaa acts on the  f spoiiab complex we constructed a mutant of  f  f w l which displayed a reproducible fluorescence response on binding to spoiiab using this mutant we were able to quantify the amount of  f bound to spoiiab in real time the results provide physical evidence for the  induced release  mechanism of  f activation we demonstrate that spoiiaa interacts directly with the  f spoiiab complex greatly decreasing the affinity of spoiiab for  f and thus causing the release of the latter we also demonstrate that  f is released before spoiiaa is phosphorylated and that release occurs on a similar time scale to the binding of spoiiaa to spoiiab
