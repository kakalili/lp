The folding of cytochrome c551 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was previously thought to follow a simple sequential mechanism, consistent with the lack of histidine residues, other than the native His16 heme ligand, that can give rise to mis-coordinated species. However, further kinetic analysis reveals complexities indicative of a folding mechanism involving parallel pathways. Double-jump interrupted refolding experiments at low pH indicate that ∼50% of the unfolded cytochrome c551 population can reach the native state via a fast (10 ms) folding track, while the rest follows a slower folding path with populated intermediates. Stopped-flow experiments using absorbance at 695 nm to monitor refolding confirm the presence of a rapidly folding species containing the native methionine-iron bond while measurements on carboxymethylated cytochrome c551 (which lacks the Met–Fe coordination bond) indicate that methionine ligation occurs late during folding along the fast folding track, which appears to be dominant at physiological pH. Continuous-flow measurements of tryptophan-heme energy transfer, using a capillary mixer with a dead time of about 60 μs, show evidence for a rapid chain collapse within 100 μs preceding the rate-limiting folding phase on the milliseconds time scale. A third process with a time constant in the 10–50 ms time range is consistent with a minor population of molecules folding along a parallel channel, as confirmed by quantitative kinetic modeling. These findings indicate the presence of two or more slowly inter-converting ensembles of denatured states that give rise to pH-dependent partitioning among fast and slow-folding pathways.
