molecular interactions between a plant virus movement protein and rna force spectroscopy investigation
rna  protein interactions are fundamental for different aspects of molecular biology such as gene expression assembly of biomolecular complexes or macromolecular transport the a movement protein mp of a plant virus cucumber mosaic virus cmv  forms ribonucleoprotein rnp complexes with viral rna capable of trafficking from cell to cell throughout the infected plant only in the presence of the cmv capsid protein cp  however deletion of the c terminal  amino acid residues of the cmv mp in the mutant designated a c  mp resulted in cp independent cell to cell movement the biological differences in the behaviour of cmv wild type wt  a mp and a c  mp could have been a consequence of differences in the rna binding properties of the two mps detected previously using biochemical assays on ensembles of molecules to investigate the physical mechanisms of mp  rna interactions at a single molecule level we applied atomic force microscopy to measure for the first time unbinding forces between these individual binding partners minimal unbinding forces determined for individual interaction of the cmv rna molecule with the cmv wt or truncated mps were estimated to be   pn and   pn respectively suggesting that the distinct differences in the strength of mp  rna interactions for the wt mp and truncated mp are attributable to the molecular binding mechanism we also demonstrated that molecules of both cmv a mp and a c  mp were capable of self interaction with minimal unbinding forces of   pn and   pn respectively providing a physical basis for the cooperative mechanism of the rna binding the significance of intermolecular force measurements for understanding the structural and functional aspects of viral rnp formation and trafficking is discussed
