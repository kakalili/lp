analysis of the thermodynamics of binding of an sh domain to proline rich peptides using a chimeric fusion protein
a complete understanding of the thermodynamic determinants of binding between sh domains and proline rich peptides is crucial to the development of rational strategies for designing ligands for these important domains recently we engineered a single chain chimeric protein by fusing the  spectrin src homology region  sh  domain to the decapeptide apsysppppp p   this chimera mimics the structural and energetic features of the interaction between sh domains and proline rich peptides here we show that analysing the unfolding thermodynamics of single point mutants of this chimeric fusion protein constitutes a very useful approach to deciphering the thermodynamics of sh  ligand interactions to this end we investigated the contribution of each proline residue of the ligand sequence to the sh  peptide interaction by producing six single pro ala mutants of the chimeric protein and analysing their unfolding thermodynamics by differential scanning calorimetry dsc  structural analyses of the mutant chimeras by circular dichroism fluorescence and nmr together with nmr relaxation measurements indicate conformational flexibility at the binding interface which is strongly affected by the different pro ala mutations an analysis of the dsc thermograms on the basis of a three state unfolding model has allowed us to distinguish and separate the thermodynamic magnitudes of the interaction at the binding interface the model assumes equilibrium between the  unbound  and  bound  states at the sh  peptide binding interface the resulting thermodynamic magnitudes classify the different proline residues according to their importance in the interaction as p  p  p  gt p  p gt p  which agrees well with lim s model for the interaction between sh domains and proline rich peptides in addition the thermodynamic signature of the interaction is the same as that usually found for this type of binding with a strong enthalpy  entropy compensation for all the mutants this compensation appears to derive from an increase in conformational flexibility concomitant to the weakening of the interactions at the binding interface we conclude that our approach based on dsc and site directed mutagenesis analysis of chimeric fusion proteins may serve as a suitable tool to analyse the energetics of weak biomolecular interactions such as those involving sh domains
