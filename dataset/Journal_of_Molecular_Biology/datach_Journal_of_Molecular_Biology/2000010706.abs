helix tilt of the m transmembrane peptide from influenza a virus an intrinsic property edited by p e wright
solid state nmr has been used to study the influence of lipid bilayer hydrophobic thickness on the tilt of a peptide m tmp representing the transmembrane portion of the m protein from influenza a using anisotropic  n chemical shifts as orientational constraints single site isotopically labeled m tmps were studied in hydrated dioleoylphosphatidylcholine dopc and dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine dmpc lipid bilayers oriented between thin glass plates these chemical shifts provide orientational information for the molecular frame with respect to the magnetic field in the laboratory frame when modeled as a uniform ideal  helix m tmp has a tilt of      in dmpc and      in dopc with respect to the bilayer normal in these lipid environments the difference in helix tilt between the two environments appears to be small this lack of a substantial change in tilt further suggests that significant interactions occur between the helices as in an oligomeric state to prevent a change in tilt in thicker lipid bilayers
