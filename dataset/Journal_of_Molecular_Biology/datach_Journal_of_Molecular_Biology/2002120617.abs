attenuating functions of the c terminus of  integrase
the tyrosine family site specific recombinases in contrast to the related type i topoisomerases which act as monomers on a single dna molecule rely on multi protein complexes to synapse partner dnas and coordinate two sequential strand exchanges involving four nicking  closing reactions here we analyze three mutants of the catalytic domain of  integrase int  a  v i  m and w  ter that are defective for normal recombination but possess increased topoisomerase activity the mutant enzymes can carry out individual dna strand exchanges using truncated substrates or holliday junctions and they show more dna cleavage activity than wild type int on isolated att sites structural modeling predicts that the substituted residues may destabilize interactions between the c terminal  strand    of int and the core of the protein the cleavage competent state of int requires the repositioning of the nucleophile y   located on   and the catalyst k  located on the flexible     loop relative to their positions in a crystal structure of the inactive conformation we propose that the anchoring of   against the protein core restrains the movement of tyr  and or lys   causing an attenuation of cleavage activity in most contexts within a bona fide recombination complex the release of strand   would allow tyr  and lys  to assume catalytically active conformations in coordination with other int protomers in the complex the loss of   packing by misalignment or truncation in the mutant proteins described here causes a loss of regulated activity thereby favoring dna cleavage activity in monomeric complexes and forfeiting the coordination of strand exchange necessary for efficient recombination
