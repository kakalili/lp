id  induces proteasome dependent degradation of the hbx protein
id  is a member of the hlh protein family that regulates a wide range of cellular processes such as cell proliferation apoptosis senescence and overexpression of id  was recently suggested to play roles in the development and progression of different cancers previously id  was shown to physically interact with the viral protein e a meanwhile id  expression was found to be regulated by several of the virus encoded proteins suggesting that id  may be a common cellular target of the viral proteins here we report that id  interacts with the hepatitis b virus hbv encoded protein hbx and regulates its stability in hepatocellular carcinoma hcc cells we found that in hcc cells ectopic id  expression significantly decreased the half life of the hbx protein indicating that hbx is destabilized by id  meanwhile the id  induced hbx degradation was found to be inhibited by treatment with proteasome inhibitor suggesting that this process is mediated through the proteasome pathway interestingly while id  did not induce hbx ubiquitination we found that removal of all the lysine residues of the hbx protein protects it from the effect of id  indicating that ubiquitination is still required for the id  mediated hbx degradation meanwhile we found that id  binds to the proteasome subunit c and facilitates its interaction with the hbx protein and disruption of this interaction completely abolishes the negative effect of id  on hbx protein stability taken together our results demonstrated a novel function of id  in regulating hbx protein stability through interaction with the proteasome
