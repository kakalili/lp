kinetics of adhesion mediated by extracellular loops of claudin  as revealed by single molecule force spectroscopy
claudins cldns comprise a large family of important transmembrane proteins that localize at tight junctions where they play a central role in regulating paracellular transportation of solutes across epithelia however molecular interactions occurring between the extracellular domains of these proteins are poorly understood here using atomic force microscopy the adhesion strength and kinetic properties of the homophilic interactions between the two extracellular loops of cldn  c e or c e  and full length cldn were characterized at the level of single molecule results show that while the first extracellular loop is sufficient for cldn cldn trans interaction the second extracellular loop does not interact with the full length cldn  with the first extracellular loop or with itself furthermore within the range of loading rates probed       pn s  dissociation of cldn cldn and c e c e complexes follows a two step energy barrier model the difference in activation energy for the inner and outer barriers of cldn cldn and c e c e dissociation was found to be   and   kbt respectively comparison of adhesion kinetics further revealed that cldn cldn dissociates at a much faster rate than c e c e  indicating that the second extracellular loop probably has an antagonistic effect on the kinetic stability of cldn mediated interactions these results provide an insight into the importance of the first extracellular loop in trans interaction of cldn mediated adhesion
