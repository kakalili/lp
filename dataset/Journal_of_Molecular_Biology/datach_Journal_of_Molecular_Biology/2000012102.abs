hdea a periplasmic protein that supports acid resistance in pathogenic enteric bacteria edited by p e wright
the x ray crystal structure of the escherichia coli stress response protein hdea has been determined at    resolution the single domain  helical protein is found in the periplasmic space where it supports an acid resistance phenotype essential for infectivity of enteric bacterial pathogens such as shigella and e coli functional studies demonstrate that hdea is activated by a dimer to monomer transition at acidic ph leading to suppression of aggregation by acid denatured proteins we suggest that hdea may support chaperone like functions during the extremely acidic conditions
