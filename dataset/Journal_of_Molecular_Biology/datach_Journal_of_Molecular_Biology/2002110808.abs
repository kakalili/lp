identifying unfolding intermediates of fn iii  by steered molecular dynamics
experimental studies have indicated that fn iii modules undergo reversible unfolding as a mechanism of elasticity the unfolding of fn iii modules including the cell binding fn iii  module has further been suggested to be functionally relevant by exposing buried cryptic sites or modulating cell binding while steered molecular dynamics smd simulations have provided one tool to investigate this process computational requirements so far have limited detailed analysis to the early stages of unfolding here we use an extended periodic box to probe the unfolding of fn iii  for extensions longer than    up to three plateaus corresponding to three metastable intermediates were observed in the extension time profile from smd stretching of fn iii  the first and second plateaus correspond to a twisted and an aligned state prior to unraveling fn iii   strands the third plateau at an extension of      follows unraveling of fn iii  a and b strands and precedes breaking of inter strand hydrogen bonds between f and g strands the simulations revealed three forced unfolding pathways of fn iii  one of which is preferentially selected under physiological conditions implications for fibronectin fibrillogenesis are discussed
