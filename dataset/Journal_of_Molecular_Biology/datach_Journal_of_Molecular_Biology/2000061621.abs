differential role of the intermolecular base pairs g  c  and g  c  in the reaction catalyzed by escherichia coli rnase p rna edited by a r fersht
we present a systematic investigation of the thermodynamic and kinetic role of the intermolecular g  c  and g  c  watson crick base pairs in the reaction catalyzed by escherichia coli rnase p rna single turnover kinetics were analyzed for wild type rnase p rna and two variants with a single g to c exchange c  or c   either acting on wild type precursor trna ptrna or derivatives carrying a complementary change at the trna   end g ca or cg a  ground state binding of trna was studied using three different methods including a novel fluorescence based assay measuring equilibrium binding we conclude that   the role of the g  c  interaction is essentially confined to watson crick base pairing with no indication for crucial tertiary contacts involving this base pair   the g  c  pair although being as important for ptrna ground state binding as g  c  is much less crucial to catalytic performance than the g  c  pair   disruption of the g  c  base pair results in preferential destabilization of enzyme transition state complexes and   the identity of the g  c  pair as part of the higher order structural context consisting of coplanar g  c  a  and g  g  a  triples contributes to high affinity binding of ptrna and catalytic efficiency
