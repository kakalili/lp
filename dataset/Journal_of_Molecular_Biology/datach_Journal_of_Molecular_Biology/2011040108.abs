the n terminal unstructured domain of yeast odc functions as a transplantable and replaceable ubiquitin independent degron
ornithine decarboxylase odc  a homodimeric enzyme with a rate limiting function in polyamine biosynthesis is subject to a feedback control involving its selective proteolysis targeting of odc monomers to the proteasome is mediated by odc antizyme oaz  the expression of which is induced by high levels of polyamines here we report our analysis of the n terminal degron in saccharomyces cerevisiae odc and the mechanism of its antizyme dependent targeting this    residue domain of odc termed odc degradation signal ods  is essential for degradation of odc extensive mutagenesis indicated that it is not a specific sequence within ods that is important but rather its unstructured nature consistent with this conclusion ods could be functionally replaced by an unrelated unstructured domain we show that increasing the distance of ods to the rest of the odc protein reduced the dependence on oaz for targeting indicating that exposure of ods is critical for its function disruption of odc dimers by introducing interface mutations in contrast was insufficient for targeting binding of oaz to odc monomers is thus required to activate ods fusion of ods to the n terminus of ura was sufficient to convert it into a ubiquitin independent substrate of the proteasome by contrast ods failed to destabilize maltose binding protein or dihydrofolate reductase indicating that this degron only operates in an appropriate structural context that enables rapid unfolding
