ordering of c terminal loop and glutaminase domains of glucosamine  phosphate synthase promotes sugar ring opening and formation of the ammonia channel
glucosamine  phosphate synthase glms channels ammonia from glutamine at the glutaminase site to fructose  phosphate fru p at the synthase site escherichia coli glms is composed of two c terminal synthase domains that form the dimer interface and two n terminal glutaminase domains at its periphery we report the crystal structures of glms alone and in complex with the glucosamine  phosphate product at     and     resolution respectively surprisingly although the whole protein is present in this crystal form no electron density for the glutaminase domain was observed indicating its mobility comparison of the two structures with that of the previously reported glms  fru p complex shows that upon sugar binding the c terminal loop which forms the major part of the channel walls becomes ordered and covers the synthase site the ordering of the glutaminase domains likely follows fru p binding by the anchoring of trp  which acts as the gate of the channel on the closed c terminal loop this is accompanied by a major conformational change of the side chain of lys   of the neighboring synthase domain that strengthens the interactions of the synthase domain with the c terminal loop and completely shields the synthase site the concomitant conformational change of the lys   gly   tripeptide places catalytic his   in the proper position to open the sugar and buries the linear sugar which is now in the vicinity of the catalytic groups involved in the sugar isomerization reaction together with the previously reported structures of glms in complex with fru p or glucose  phosphate and a glutamine analogue the new structures reveal the structural changes occurring during the whole catalytic cycle
