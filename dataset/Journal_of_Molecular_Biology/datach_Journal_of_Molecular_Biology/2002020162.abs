the intercalating  hairpin of t rna polymerase plays a role in promoter dna melting and in stabilizing the melted dna for efficient rna synthesis edited by r ebright
phage t rna polymerase contains within its single polypeptide all the elements for specific recognition and melting of its promoter dna crystallographic studies indicate that a  hairpin       with an intercalating valine residue plays a role in promoter opening we mutated v  to several amino acids deleted five amino acid residues at the tip of the hairpin and mutated e  and d  at the base of the hairpin to define the roles of the tip and base of the hairpin in dna strand separation the affinity of the hairpin mutants for the promoter dna was not significantly affected stopped flow kinetic studies showed that the bimolecular rate of dna binding and the observed rate of pre initiation open complex formation that corresponds to the sum of dna opening and closing steps were within  to   of the wild type polymerase yet most mutants showed a smaller amount of the pre initiation open complex at equilibrium indicating that the individual rates of promoter opening and closing steps were altered in the mutants the base mutants e  a and d  a showed both a lower rate of promoter opening and a higher rate of promoter closing suggesting their role in stabilization of the open complex the v  d and the deletion mutant showed mainly a lower rate of promoter opening suggesting that the tip of the hairpin may nucleate dna opening the defect in pre initiation open complex formation affected downstream steps such as the rate of the first phosphodiester bond formation step but did not affect significantly the apparent kd of initiating gtps we propose that d  and e  anchor the hairpin to the dna and position the tip of the hairpin to allow v  to intercalate and distort the dna during open complex formation the interactions of e  and d  with the upstream junction of the melted dsdna promoter also align the template strand within the active site for efficient rna synthesis
