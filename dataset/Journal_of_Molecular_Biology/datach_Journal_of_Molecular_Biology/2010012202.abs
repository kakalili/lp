inhibition of collagen fibrillogenesis by cells expressing soluble extracellular domains of ddr and ddr
collagen fiber assembly affects many physiological processes and is tightly controlled by collagen binding proteins however to what extent membrane bound versus cell secreted collagen binding proteins affect collagen fibrillogenesis is not well understood in our previous studies we had demonstrated that the membrane anchored extracellular domain ecd of the collagen receptor discoidin domain receptor  ddr  inhibits fibrillogenesis of collagen endogenously secreted by the cells these results led to a novel functional role of the ddr ecd however since soluble forms of ddr and ddr containing its ecd are known to naturally exist in the extracellular matrix in this work we investigated if these soluble ddr ecds may have a functional role in modulating collagen fibrillogenesis for this purpose we created mouse osteoblast cell lines stably secreting ddr or ddr ecd as soluble proteins transmission electron microscopy fluorescence microscopy and hydroxyproline assays were used to demonstrate that ddr ecd expression reduced the rate and quantity of collagen deposition and induced significant changes in fiber morphology and matrix mineralization collectively our studies advance our understanding of ddr receptors as powerful regulators of collagen deposition in the ecm and elucidate their multifaceted role in ecm remodeling
