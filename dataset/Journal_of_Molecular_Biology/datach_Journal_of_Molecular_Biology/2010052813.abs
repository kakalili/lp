growth of collagen fibril seeds from embryonic tendon fractured fibril ends nucleate new tip growth
collagen fibrils are the principal tensile element of vertebrate tissues where they occur in the extracellular matrix as spatially organised arrays a major challenge is to understand how the mechanisms of nucleation growth and remodelling yield fibrils of tissue specific diameter and length here we have developed a seeding system whereby collagen fibrils were isolated from avian embryonic tendon and added to purified collagen solution in order to characterise fibril surface nucleation and growth mechanisms fragmentation of tendon in liquid nitrogen followed by dounce homogenisation generated fibril length fragments most  gt   of the fractured ends of fibrils which show an abrupt square profile were found to act as nucleation sites for further growth by molecular accretion the mechanism of this nucleation and growth process was investigated by transmission electron microscopy atomic force microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy mass mapping typically a single growth spur occurred on the n terminal end of seed fibrils whilst twin spurs frequently formed on the c terminal end before merging into a single tip projection the surface nucleation and growth process generated a smoothly tapered tip that achieved maximum diameter when the axial extension reached     m lateral growth also occurred along the entire length of all seed fibrils that contained tip projections the data support a model of collagen fibril growth in which the broken ends of fibrils are nucleation sites for propagation in opposite axial directions the observed fibril growth behaviour has direct relevance to tendon matrix remodelling and repair processes that might involve rupture of collagen fibrils
