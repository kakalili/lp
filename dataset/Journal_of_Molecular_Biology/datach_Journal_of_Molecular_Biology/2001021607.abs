exploration of partially unfolded states of human  lactalbumin by molecular dynamics simulation edited by b honig
molecular dynamics simulations are used to probe the properties of non native states of the protein human  lactalbumin human  la with a detailed atomistic model in an implicit aqueous solvent environment to sample the conformational space a biasing force is introduced that increases the radius of gyration relative to the native state and generates a large number of low energy conformers that differ in terms of their root mean square deviation for a given radius of gyration the resulting structures are relaxed by unbiased simulations and used as models of the molten globule and partly denatured states of human  la based on measured radii of gyration obtained from nuclear magnetic resonance experiments the ensembles of structures agree in their overall properties with experimental data available for the human  la molten globule and its more denatured states in particular the simulation results show that the native like fold of the  domain is preserved in the molten globule further a considerable proportion of the antiparallel  strand in the  domain are present this indicates that the lack of hydrogen exchange protection found experimentally for the  domain is due to rearrangement of the  sheet involving transient populations of non native  structures the simulations also provide details concerning the ensemble of structures that contribute as the molten globule unfolds and shows in accord with experimental data that unfolding is not cooperative i e the various structural elements do not unfold simultaneously
