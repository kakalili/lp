impact of the terminal bulges of hiv  ctar dna on its stability and the destabilizing activity of the nucleocapsid protein ncp
reverse transcription of hiv  genomic rna to double stranded dna by reverse transcriptase rt is a critical step in hiv  replication this process relies on two viral proteins the rt enzyme and nucleocapsid protein ncp that has well documented nucleic acid chaperone properties at the beginning of the linear dna synthesis the newly made minus strand strong stop dna    ssdna is transferred to the   end of the genomic rna by means of an hybridization reaction between transactivation response element tar rna and ctar dna sequences since both tar sequences exhibit stable hairpin structures ncp needs to destabilize the tar structures in order to chaperone their hybridization to further characterize the relationships between tar stability and nc mediated destabilization the role of the a  and g  bulged residues in ctar dna stability was investigated the stability of ctar and mutants where one or the two terminal bulges were replaced by base pairs as well as the ncp mediated destabilization of these ctar sequences were examined thermodynamic data indicate that the two bulges cooperatively destabilize ctar by reducing the stacking interactions between the bases this causes a free energy change of about  kcal mol and seems to be critical for nc activity time resolved fluorescence data of doubly labelled ctar derivatives suggest that nc mediated melting of ctar ends propagates up to the  c a  mismatch or t  bulge fluorescence correlation spectroscopy using two photon excitation was also used to monitor ctar ends fraying by nc results show that nc causes a very significant increase of ctar ends fraying probably limited to the terminal base pair in the case of ctar mutants since the tar rna and ctar dna bulges or mismatches appear well conserved among all hiv  strains the present data support the notion of a co evolutionary relationship between tar and nc activity
