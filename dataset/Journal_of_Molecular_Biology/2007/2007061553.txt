Polycystin-1 is the gene product of PKD1, the first gene identified to be causative for the condition of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Mutations in PKD1 are responsible for the majority of ADPKD cases worldwide. Polycystin-1 is a protein of the transient receptor potential channels superfamily, with 11 transmembrane spans and an extracellular N-terminal region of ∼3109 amino acid residues, harboring multiple putative ligand binding domains. We demonstrate here that annexin A5 (ANXA5), a Ca2+ and phospholipid binding protein, interacts with the N-terminal leucine-rich repeats of polycystin-1, in vitro and in a cell culture model. This interaction is direct and specific and involves a conserved sequence of the ANXA5 N-terminal domain. Using Madin-Darby canine kidney cells expressing polycystin-1 in an inducible manner we also show that polycystin-1 colocalizes with E-cadherin at cell–cell contacts and accelerates the recruitment of intracellular E-cadherin to reforming junctions. This polycystin-1 stimulated recruitment is significantly delayed by extracellular annexin A5.
