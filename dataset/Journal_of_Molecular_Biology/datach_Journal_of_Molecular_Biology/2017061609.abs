oligomeric structure of anabaena sensory rhodopsin in a lipid bilayer environment by combining solid state nmr and long range deer constraints
oligomerization of membrane proteins is common in nature here we combine spin labeling double electron  electron resonance deer and solid state nmr ssnmr spectroscopy to refine the structure of an oligomeric integral membrane protein anabaena sensory rhodopsin asr  reconstituted in a lipid environment an essential feature of such a combined approach is that it provides structural distance restraints spanning a range of ca     while using the same sample preparation i e  mutations paramagnetic labeling and reconstitution in lipid bilayers for both ssnmr and deer direct modeling of the multispin effects on deer signal allowed for the determination of the oligomeric order and for obtaining long range deer distance restraints between the asr trimer subunits that were used to refine the ssnmr structure of asr the improved structure of the asr trimer revealed a more compact packing of helices and side chains at the intermonomer interface compared to the structure determined using the ssnmr data alone the extent of the refinement is significant when compared with typical helix movements observed for the active states of homologous proteins our combined approach of using complementary deer and nmr measurements for the determination of oligomeric structures would be widely applicable to membrane proteins where paramagnetic tags can be introduced such a method could be used to study the effects of the lipid membrane composition on protein oligomerization and to observe structural changes in protein oligomers upon drug substrate and co factor binding
