characterization of nmr relaxation active motions of a partially folded a state analogue of ubiquitin edited by p e wright
the dominant dynamics of a partially folded a state analogue of ubiquitin that give rise to nmr  n spin relaxation have been investigated using molecular dynamics md computer simulations and reorientational quasiharmonic analysis starting from the x ray structure of native ubiquitin with a protonation state corresponding to a low ph the a state analogue was generated by a md simulation of a total length of  ns in a     methanol water mixture using a variable temperature scheme to control and speed up the structural transformation the n terminal half of the a state analogue consists of loosely coupled native like secondary structural elements while the c terminal half is mostly irregular in structure analysis of dipolar n h backbone correlation functions reveals reorientational amplitudes and time scale distributions that are comparable to those observed experimentally thus the trajectory provides a realistic picture of a partially folded protein that can be used for gaining a better understanding of the various types of reorientational motions that are manifested in spin relaxation parameters of partially folded systems for this purpose a reorientational quasiharmonic reorientational analysis was performed on the final  ns of the trajectory of the a state analogue and for comparison on a  ns trajectory of native ubiquitin the largest amplitude reorientational modes show a markedly distinct behavior for the two states while for native ubiquitin such motions have a more local character involving loops and the c terminal end of the polypeptide chain the a state analogue shows highly collective motions in the nanosecond time scale range corresponding to larger scale movements between different segments changes in reorientational backbone entropy between the a state analogue and the native state of ubiquitin which were computed from the reorientational quasiharmonic analyses are found to depend significantly on motional correlation effects
