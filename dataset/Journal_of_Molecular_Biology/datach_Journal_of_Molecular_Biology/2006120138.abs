dbc is essential for transporting vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein
dbc is a tumor suppressor gene linked to breast and lung cancers although dbc belongs to the rho gtpase family it has a unique structure that contains a broad complex tramtrack bric a brac btb domain at the c terminus instead of a typical caax motif a limited number of functional studies on dbc have indicated its participation in diverse cellular activities such as ubiquitination cell cycle control cytoskeleton organization and protein transport in this study the role of dbc in protein transport was analyzed using vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein vsvg fused with green fluorescent protein we discovered that dbc knockdown hinders the vsvg transport system in   cells previous studies have demonstrated that vsvg is transported via the microtubule motor complex we demonstrate that dbc mobility depends also on an intact microtubule network we conclude that dbc plays an essential role in microtubule mediated vsvg transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the golgi apparatus
