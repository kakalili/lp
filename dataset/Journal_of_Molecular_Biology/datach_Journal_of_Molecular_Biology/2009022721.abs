effect of interdomain linker length on an antagonistic folding  unfolding equilibrium between two protein domains
fusion of one protein domain with another is a common event in both evolution and protein engineering experiments when insertion is at an internal site e g  a surface loop or turn  as opposed to one of the termini conformational strain can be introduced into both domains strain is manifested by an antagonistic folding  unfolding equilibrium between the two domains which we previously showed can be parameterized by a coupling free energy term  gx  the extent of strain is predicted to depend primarily on the ratio of the n to c distance of the guest protein to the distance between ends of the surface loop in the host protein here we test that hypothesis by inserting ubiquitin ub into the bacterial ribonuclease barnase bn  using peptide linkers from zero to  amino acids each  gx values are determined by measuring the extent to which co  binding to an engineered site on the ub domain destabilizes the bn domain all atom unforced langevin dynamics simulations are employed to gain structural insight into the mechanism of mechanically induced unfolding experimental and computational results find that the two domains are structurally and energetically uncoupled when linkers are long and that  gx increases with decreasing linker length when the linkers are fewer than two amino acids strain is so great that one domain unfolds the other however the protein is able to refold as dimers and higher order oligomers the likely mechanism is a three dimensional domain swap of the bn domain which relieves conformational strain the simulations suggest that an effective route to mechanical unfolding begins with disruption of the hydrophobic core of bn near the ub insertion site
