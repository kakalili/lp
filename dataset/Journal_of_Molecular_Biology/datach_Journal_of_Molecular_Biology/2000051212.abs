reassembly of lumbricus terrestris hemoglobin a study by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry and d reconstruction from frozen hydrated specimens edited by w baumeister
dodecamers and four types of linker chains l l  were purified from dissociated hemoglobin of the earthworm lumbricus terrestris various preparations comprising dodecamer of globin chains and linker chains were allowed to reassemble at neutral ph they produced various oligomers that were purified by gel filtration analyzed in matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry and submitted to d reconstruction from isolated particles observed in cryoelectron microscopy despite the impossibility to completely free the l  l  and l preparations from l  the following conclusions were obtained first hemoglobin molecules indistinguishable from native hemoglobin at    resolution were obtained in the absence of linker chains l  l  or l  second the d reconstruction volumes of reassembled hemoglobins containing dodecamers and l l or dodecamers and l l demonstrate that reassembly of native like structures can be obtained from at most two linker chains and dodecamers third the d reconstruction volumes of native and reassembled hemoglobins containing dodecamers and   l  l  and l    l  l  and l    l and l  and   l and l were highly similar since these structures comprise two types of substructures one involved in the c a c b and c linking units of the hollow globular substructure and the other in the c connection and the toroid  it seems highly probable that the minimal number of linker chains required to reassemble native like hemoglobin is at most two
