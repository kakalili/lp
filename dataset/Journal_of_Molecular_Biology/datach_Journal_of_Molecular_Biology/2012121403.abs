impaired folding of the mitochondrial small tim chaperones induces clearance by the i aaa protease
the intermembrane space of mitochondria contains a dedicated chaperone network  the small translocase of the inner membrane tim family  for the sorting of hydrophobic precursors all small tims are defined by the presence of a twin cx c motif and the monomeric proteins are stabilized by two intramolecular disulfide bonds formed between the cysteines of these motifs the conserved cysteine residues within small tim members have also been shown to participate in early biogenesis events with the most n terminal cysteine residue important for import and retention within the intermembrane space via the receptor and disulfide oxidase mia  in this study we have analyzed the in vivo consequences of improper folding of small tim chaperones by generating site specific cysteine mutants and assessed the fate of the incompletely oxidized proteins within mitochondria we show that no individual cysteine residue is required for the function of tim or tim  in yeast and that defective assembly of the small tims induces their proteolytic clearance from mitochondria we delineate a clearance mechanism for the mutant proteins and their unassembled wild type partner protein by the mitochondrial atp dependent protease yme  yeast mitochondrial escape
