transcription activation by escherichia coli rob at class ii promoters protein  protein interactions between rob s n terminal domain and the   subunit of rna polymerase
bacterial transcription activators regulate transcription by making essential protein  protein interactions with rna polymerase for example with region  of the   subunit    r  rob soxs and mara comprise a closely related subset of members of the arac xyls family of transcription factors that activate transcription of both class i and class ii promoters recently we showed that interactions between soxs and   r occlude the binding of   r to the    promoter element of class ii promoters although rob shares many similarities with soxs it contains a c terminal domain ctd that the other paralogs do not thus a goal of this study was to determine whether rob makes protein  protein interactions with   r at class ii promoters and if so whether the interactions occlude the binding of   r to the    hexamer despite the presence of the ctd we found that although rob makes fewer interactions with   r than soxs the two proteins make the same unusual position dependent interactions importantly we found that rob occludes   r from binding the    hexamer just as does soxs thus the ctd does not substantially alter the way rob interacts with   r at class ii promoters moreover in contrast to inferences drawn from the co crystal structure of rob bound to robbox dna which showed that only one of rob s dual helix  turn  helix hth dna binding motifs binds a recognition element of the promoter s robbox we determined that the two hth motifs each bind a recognition element in vivo
