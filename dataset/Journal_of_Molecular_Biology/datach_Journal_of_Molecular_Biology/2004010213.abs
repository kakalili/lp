dimeric rous sarcoma virus capsid protein structure relevant to immature gag assembly
the structure of the n terminal domain ntd of rous sarcoma virus rsv capsid protein ca  with an upstream  amino acid residue extension corresponding to the c terminal portion of the gag p  protein has been determined by x ray crystallography purified gag proteins of retroviruses can assemble in vitro into virus like particles closely resembling in vivo assembled immature virus particles but without a membrane when the  amino acid residues upstream of ca are deleted gag assembles into tubular particles the same phenotype is observed in vivo thus these residues act as a  shape determinant  promoting spherical assembly when they are present or tubular assembly when they are absent we show that unlike the ntd on its own the extended ntd protein has no  hairpin loop at the n terminus of ca and that the molecule forms a dimer in which the amino terminal extension forms the interface between monomers since dimerization of gag has been inferred to be a critical step in assembly of spherical immature gag particles the dimer interface may represent a structural feature that is essential in retrovirus assembly
