characterization of two novel aldo  keto reductases from arabidopsis expression patterns broad substrate specificity and an open active site structure suggest a role in toxicant metabolism following stress
aldo  keto reductases akrs are widely distributed in nature and play numerous roles in the metabolism of steroids sugars and other carbonyls they have also frequently been implicated in the metabolism of exogenous and endogenous toxicants including those stimulated by stress although the arabidopsis genome includes at least  genes with the akr signature very little is known of their functions in this study we have screened the arabidopsis thaliana genomic sequence for genes with significant homology to members of the mammalian akr family and identified four homologues for further study following alignment of the predicted protein sequences with representatives from the akr superfamily the proteins were ascribed not to the akr family but to the akr c subfamily with the individual designations of akr c  akr c  akr c  and akr c  expression of two of the genes akr c and akr c  has been shown to be coordinately regulated and markedly induced by various forms of stress the genes have been overexpressed in bacteria and recombinant proteins have been purified and crystallized both enzymes display nadph dependent reduction of carbonyl compounds typical of the superfamily but will accept a very wide range of substrates reducing a range of steroids sugars and aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes ketones although there are distinct differences between the two enzymes we have obtained high resolution crystal structures of akr c      and akr c       in ternary complexes with nadp and acetate three extended loops present in all akrs and responsible for defining the cofactor and substrate binding sites are shorter in the c subfamily compared to other akrs consequently the crystal structures reveal open and accommodative substrate binding sites which correlates with their broad substrate specificity it is suggested that the primary role of these enzymes may be to detoxify a range of toxic aldehydes and ketones produced during stress although the precise nature of the principal natural substrates remains to be determined
