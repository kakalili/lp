a variable domain near the atp binding site in drosophila muscle myosin is part of the communication pathway between the nucleotide and actin binding sites
drosophila expresses several muscle myosin isoforms from a single gene by alternatively splicing six of the  exons here we investigate exon  which codes for a region in the upper   kda domain near the nucleotide binding pocket this region is of interest because it is also the place where a large insert is found in myosin vi and where several cardiomyopathy mutations have been identified in human cardiac myosin we expressed and purified chimeric muscle myosins from drosophila each varying at exon  two chimeras exchanged the entire exon  domain between the indirect flight muscle ifi normally containing exon d and embryonic body wall muscle emb normally containing exon a isoforms to create ifi a and emb d the second two chimeras replaced each half of the exon a domain in emb with the corresponding portion of exon d to create emb a d and emb d a transient kinetic studies of the motor domain from these myosin isoforms revealed changes in several kinetic parameters between the ifi or emb isoforms and the chimeras of significance were changes in nucleotide binding which differed in the presence and absence of actin consistent with a model in which the exon  domain is part of the communication pathway between the nucleotide and actin binding sites homology models of the structures suggest how the exon  domain might modulate this pathway
