structure of a single chain fv bound to the  n terminal residues of huntingtin provides insights into pathogenic amyloid formation and suppression
huntington s disease is triggered by misfolding of fragments of mutant forms of the huntingtin protein mhtt with aberrant polyglutamine expansions the c single chain fv antibody scfv binds to the first  residues of huntingtin htt    and generates substantial protection against multiple phenotypic pathologies in situ and in vivo we show in this paper that c scfv inhibits amyloid formation by exon fragments of huntingtin in vitro and elucidate the structural basis for this inhibition and protection by determining the crystal structure of the complex of c scfv and htt    the peptide binds with residues    forming an amphipathic helix that makes contact with the antibody fragment in such a way that the hydrophobic face of this helix is shielded from the solvent residues     of the peptide are in an extended conformation and interact with the same region of another c scfv htt    complex in the asymmetric unit resulting in a  sheet interface within a dimeric c scfv htt    complex the nature of this scfv  peptide complex was further explored in solution by high resolution nmr and physicochemical analysis of species in solution the results provide insights into the manner in which c scfv inhibits the aggregation of htt and hence into its therapeutic potential and suggests a structural basis for the initial interactions that underlie the formation of disease associated amyloid fibrils by htt
