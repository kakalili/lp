functional analysis of bamhi dna cytosine n methyltransferase
we show that the kinetic mechanism of the dna cytosine n  methyltransferase m bamhi which modifies the underlined cytosine ggatcc  differs from cytosine c methyltransferases and is similar to that observed with adenine n methyltransferases this suggests that the obligate order of ternary complex assembly and disassembly depends on the type of methylation reaction in contrast the single turnover rate of catalysis for m bamhi   s   is closer to the dna cytosine c  methyltransferases   s   than the dna adenine n  methyltransferases  gt  s    the nucleotide flipping transition dominates the single turnover constant for adenine n methyltransferases and since the disruption of the guanine cytosine base pair is essential for both types of cytosine dna methyltransferases this transition may be a common rate limiting step for methylation for these two enzyme subclasses the similar overall rate of catalysis by m bamhi and other dna methyltransferases is consistent with a common rate limiting catalytic step of product dissociation our analyses of m bamhi provide functional insights into the relationship between the three different classes of dna methyltransferases that complement both prior structural and evolutionary insights
