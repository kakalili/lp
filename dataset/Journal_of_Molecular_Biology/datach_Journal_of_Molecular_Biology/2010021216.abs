ribosomal interaction of bacillus stearothermophilus translation initiation factor if  characterization of the active sites
infb encoded translation initiation factor if contains a non conserved n terminal domain and two conserved domains g and c constituted by three g  g and g  and two c and c  sub domains here we show that  i bacillus stearothermophilus if complements in vivo an escherichia coli infb null mutation and ii the n domain of b stearothermophilus if  like that of e coli if  provides a strong yet dispensable interaction with   s and   s subunits in spite of the lack of any size sequence or structural homology between the n domains of the two factors furthermore the nature of the b stearothermophilus if sites involved in establishing the functional interactions with the ribosome was investigated by generating deletion random and site directed mutations within sub domains g or g of a molecule carrying an h  y substitution in switch ii of the g module which impairs the ribosome dependent gtpase activity of if  by selecting suppressors of the dominant lethal phenotype caused by the h  y substitution three independent mutants impaired in ribosome binding were identified namely s  p in g  and g  e and e  k in g  the functional properties of these mutants and those of the deletion mutants are compatible with the premise that if interacts with   s and   s subunits via g and g modules respectively however beyond this generalization because the mutation in g resulted in a functional alteration of g and vice versa our results indicate the existence of extensive  cross talking  between these two modules highlighting a harmonic conformational cooperation between g and g required for a functional interaction between if and the two ribosomal subunits it is noteworthy that the e  k mutant which completely lacks gtpase activity displays if wild type capacity in supporting initiation of dipeptide formation
