biochemical and structural characterization of  catenin interactions with nonphosphorylated and ck phosphorylated lef
in the wnt  catenin signaling pathway   catenin activates target genes through its interactions with the t cell factor lymphoid enhancer binding factor tcf lef family of transcription factors the crystal structures of complexes between the  catenin armadillo domain and the lef  n terminal domain show that the overall conformation and many of the interactions are similar to other published structures of tcfs bound to  catenin however a second salt bridge in other tcf   catenin structures is absent in the structure of  catenin  lef  complex indicating that this feature is not obligatory for  catenin binding casein kinase ii ck  has been shown to act as a positive regulator of wnt signaling and lef  is a substrate of ck  in vitro phosphorylation of purified lef  was used to examine the effect of ck on the interaction of lef  with  catenin mass spectrometry data show that ck phosphorylation of lef  n terminal domain results in a single phosphorylation site at ser  isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that  catenin binds to nonphosphorylated or ck phosphorylated lef  with the same affinity which is consistent with the absence of phospho ser  interactions in the crystal structure of phosphorylated lef  n terminal domain bound to  catenin these data indicate that the effect of ck on the wnt  catenin pathway does not appear to be at the level of the lef    catenin interaction
