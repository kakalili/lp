synergy of repression and silencing gradients along the chromosome
the expression of a gene is determined by the transcriptional activators and repressors bound to its regulatory regions it is not clear how these opposing activities are summed to define the degree of silencing of genes within a segment of the eukaryotic chromosome we show that the general repressor ssn and the silencing protein sir generate inhibitory gradients with similar slopes over a transcribed gene even though ssn is considered a promoter specific repressor of single genes while sir is a regional silencer when two repression or silencing gradients flank a gene they have a multiplicative effect on gene expression a significant amplification of the interacting gradients distinguishes silencing from repression when a silencing gradient is enhanced the distance dependence of the amplification changes and long range effects are established preferentially these observations reveal that repression and silencing proteins can attain different tiers in a hierarchy of conserved regulatory modes the quantitative rules associated with these modes will help to explain the co expression pattern of adjacent genes in the genome
