the structure of cmp  keto  deoxy manno octonic acid synthetase and of its complexes with substrates and substrate analogs edited by i a wilson
the enzyme cmp kdo synthetase cks catalyzes the activation of the sugar kdo  keto  deoxy manno octonic acid by forming a monophosphate diester cks is a pharmaceutical target because cmp kdo is used in the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharides that are vital for gram negative bacteria we have refined the structure of the unligated capsule specific cks from escherichia coli at    resolution      nm and we have established the structures of its complexes with the substrate ctp with cdp and cmp as well as with the product analog cmp neuac cmp sialate by x ray diffraction analyses at resolutions between    and     the n terminal domains of the dimeric enzyme bind ctp in a peculiar nucleotide binding fold whereas the c terminal domains form the dimer interface the observed binding geometries together with the amino acid variabilities during evolution and the locations of a putative mg  and of a very strongly bound water molecule suggest a pathway for the catalysis the n terminal domain shows sequence homology with the cmp neuac synthetases moreover the chain fold and the substrate binding position of cks resemble those of other enzymes processing nucleotide sugars
