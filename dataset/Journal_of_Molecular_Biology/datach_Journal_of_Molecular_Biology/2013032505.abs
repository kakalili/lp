catalytic metal ion rearrangements underline promiscuity and evolvability of a metalloenzyme
although largely deemed as structurally conserved catalytic metal ion sites can rearrange thereby contributing to enzyme evolvability here we show that in paraoxonase  a lipo lactonase catalytic promiscuity and divergence into an organophosphate hydrolase are correlated with an alternative mode of the catalytic ca  we describe the crystal structures of active site mutants bearing mutations at position   the histidine at this position acts as a base to activate the lactone hydrolyzing water molecule mutations to trp or gln indeed diminish paraoxonase  s lactonase activity however the promiscuous organophosphate hydrolase activity is enhanced the structures reveal a    upward displacement towards the enzyme s surface of the catalytic ca  in the his  mutants and configurational changes in the ligating side chains and water molecules relative to the wild type enzyme biochemical analysis and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that this alternative upward metal mode mediates the promiscuous hydrolysis of organophosphates the upward ca  mode observed in the his  mutants also appears to mediate the wild type s paraoxonase activity however whereas the upward mode dominates in the trp  mutant it is scarcely populated in wild type thus the plasticity of active site metal ions may permit alternative latent promiscuous activities and also provide the basis for the divergence of new enzymatic functions
