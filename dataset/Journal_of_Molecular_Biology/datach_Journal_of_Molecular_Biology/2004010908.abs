symmetric k and mg  ion binding sites in the s rrna loop e inferred from molecular dynamics simulations
potassium binding to the s rrna loop e motif has been studied by molecular dynamics at high   m and low   m concentration of added kcl in the presence and absence of mg  a clear pattern of seven deep groove k binding sites or regions in all cases connected with guanine n o atoms belonging to gpg gpa and gpu steps was identified indicating that the le deep groove is significantly more ionophilic than the equivalent groove of regular rna duplexes among all two symmetry related sites with respect to the central g a pair were found to accommodate k ions with particularly long residence times in a preceding molecular dynamics study by auffinger et al in the year    these two sites were described as constituting important mg  binding locations altogether the data suggest that these symmetric sites correspond to the loop e main ion binding regions indeed they are located in the deep groove of an important ribosomal protein binding motif associated with a fragile pattern of non watson  crick pairs that has certainly to be stabilized by specific mg  ions in order to be efficiently recognized by the protein besides the other sites accommodate monovalent ions in a more diffuse way pointing out their lesser significance for the structure and function of this motif ion binding to the shallow groove and backbone atoms was generally found to be of minor importance since at the low concentration no well defined binding site could be characterized while high k concentration promoted mostly unspecific potassium binding to the rna backbone in addition several k binding sites were located in positions equivalent to water molecules from the first hydration shell of divalent ions in simulations performed with magnesium indicating that ion binding regions are able to accommodate both mono and divalent ionic species overall the simulations provide a more precise but at the same time a more intricate view of the relations of this motif with its ionic surrounding
