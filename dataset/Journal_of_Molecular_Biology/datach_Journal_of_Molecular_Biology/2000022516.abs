mechanisms ensuring rapid and complete dna replication despite random initiation in xenopus early embryos edited by m yaniv
chromosome replication initiates without sequence specificity at average intervals of    kb during the rapid cell cycles of early xenopus embryos if the distribution of origins were random some inter origin intervals would be too long to be fully replicated before the end of s phase to investigate what ensures rapid completion of dna replication we have examined the replication intermediates of plasmids of various sizes       kbp in xenopus egg extracts by two dimensional gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy we confirm that replication initiates without sequence specificity on all plasmids we demonstrate for the first time that multiple initiation events occur on large plasmids but not on small  lt  kb plasmids at average intervals of    kb origin interference may prevent multiple initiation events on small plasmids multiple initiation events are neither synchronous nor regularly spaced bubble density is higher on later than on earlier replication intermediates showing that initiation frequency increases throughout s phase speeding up replication of late intermediates we suggest that potential origins are abundant and randomly distributed but that the increase of initiation frequency during s phase and possibly origin interference regulate origin activation to ensure rapid completion of replication
