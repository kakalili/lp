domain swapping in the sporulation response regulator spo a edited by a r fersht
adaptive responses of micro organisms such as chemotaxis and sporulation are governed by two component systems consisting of sensor kinases that interpret environmental signals and response regulators which activate the appropriate physiological responses signal transduction via response regulator proteins is mediated through transient phosphorylation of aspartic acid residues in spo a the key regulator of development sporulation in bacillus phosphorylation of the n terminal receiver domain n spo a at aspartate  switches on the transcription activation functions residing in the c terminal effector domain here we report the crystal structure of n spo a from bacillus stearothermophilus at    spacing revealing a dimer formed by an  helix swap comparison of this structure with the recently described structure of phosphorylated n spo a shows that dimer formation results from a cis trans isomerization of the lys  pro  peptide bond the quaternary reorganization is associated with alterations in the active site stereochemistry which may have implications for signalling remarkably this  d domain swapped n spo a dimer has an identical topology to a hypothetical chey like dimer recently proposed as an intermediate in the evolution of the family of periplasmic substrate binding proteins
