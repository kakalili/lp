effects of salts on internal dna pressure and mechanical properties of phage capsids
based on atomic force microscopy nanoindentation measurements of phage   we previously proposed a minimal model describing the effect of water hydrating dna that strengthens viral capsids against external deformation at wild type dna packing density here we report proof of this model by testing the prediction that dna hydration forces can be dramatically decreased by addition of multivalent ions mg  and sp   these results are explained using a dna hydration model without adjustable parameters the model also predicts the stiffness of other dna filled capsids which we confirm using bacteriophage   and herpes simplex virus type  particles
