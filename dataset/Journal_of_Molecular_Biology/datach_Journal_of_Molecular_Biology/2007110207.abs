structural basis of ligand binding and release in insect pheromone binding proteins nmr structure of antheraea polyphemus pbp at ph
the nmr structure of the antheraea polyphemus pheromone binding protein  at ph   apolpbp a was determined at    c the structure consists of six  helices which are arranged in a globular fold that encapsulates a central helix   formed by the c terminal polypeptide segment      the d arrangement of these helices is anchored by the three disulfide bonds          and      which were identified by nmr superposition of the apolpbp a structure with the structure of the homologous pheromone binding protein of bombyx mori at ph   bmorpbpa yielded an rmsd of     calculated for the backbone heavy atoms n c  and c  of residues      in contrast the present apolpbp a structure is different from a recently proposed molecular model for a low ph form of apolpbp that does not contain the central helix   apolpbp exhibits a ph dependent transition between two different globular conformations in slow exchange on the nmr chemical shift timescale similar to bmorpbp suggesting that the two proteins use the same mechanism of ligand binding and ejection the extensive sequence homology observed for pheromone binding proteins from moth species further implies that the previously proposed mechanism of ligand ejection involving the insertion of a c terminal helix into the pheromone binding site is a general feature of pheromone signaling in moths
