rna induces conformational changes in the sf u af  splicing factor complex
spliceosomes assemble on pre mrna splice sites through a series of dynamic ribonucleoprotein complexes yet the nature of the conformational changes remains unclear splicing factor  sf  and u auxiliary factor u af  cooperatively recognize the   splice site during the initial stages of pre mrna splicing here we used small angle x ray scattering to compare the molecular dimensions and ab initio shape restorations of sf and u af  splicing factors as well as the sf u af  complex in the absence and presence of adml adenovirus major late splice site rnas the molecular dimensions of the sf u af  rna complex substantially contracted by    in the maximum dimension relative to the sf u af  complex in the absence of rna ligand in contrast no detectable changes were observed for the isolated sf and u af  splicing factors or their individual complexes with rna although slight differences in the shapes of their molecular envelopes were apparent we propose that the conformational changes that are induced by assembly of the sf u af  rna complex serve to position the pre mrna splice site optimally for subsequent stages of splicing
