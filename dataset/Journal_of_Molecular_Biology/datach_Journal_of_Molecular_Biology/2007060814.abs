crystal structure of the marasmius oreades mushroom lectin in complex with a xenotransplantation epitope
moa a lectin from the mushroom marasmius oreades is one of the few reagents that specifically agglutinate blood group b erythrocytes further it is the only lectin known to have exclusive specificity for gal    gal containing sugar epitopes which are antigens that pose a severe barrier to animal to human organ transplantation we describe here the structure of moa at    resolution in complex with the linear trisaccharide gal    gal    glcnac the structure is dimeric with two distinct domains per protomer the n terminal lectin module adopts a ricinb  trefoil fold and contains three putative carbohydrate binding sites while the c terminal domain serves as a dimerization interface this latter domain which has an unknown function reveals a novel fold with intriguing conservation of an active site cleft a number of indications suggest that moa may have an enzymatic function in addition to the sugar binding properties
