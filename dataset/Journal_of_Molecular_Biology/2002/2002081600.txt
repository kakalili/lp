Chrysanthemum chlorotic mottle viroid (CChMVd) is a small RNA (398â€“401nt) with hammerhead ribozymes in both polarity strands that mediate self-cleavage of the oligomeric RNA intermediates generated in a rolling-circle mechanism of replication. Within the in vivo branched RNA conformation of CChMVd, a tetraloop has been identified as a major determinant of pathogenicity. Here we present a detailed study of this tetraloop by site-directed mutagenesis, bioassay of the CChMV-cDNA clones and analysis of the resulting progenies. None of the changes introduced in the tetraloop, including its substitution by a triloop or a pentaloop, abolished infectivity. In contrast to observations for other RNAs, the thermodynamically stable GAAA tetraloop characteristic of non-symptomatic CChMVd-NS strains was not functionally interchangeable for other stable tetraloops of the UNCG family, suggesting that the sequence, rather than the structure, is the major factor governing conservation of this motif. In most cases, the changes introduced initially led to symptomless infections, which eventually evolved to be symptomatic concurrently with the prevalence in the progeny of the UUUC tetraloop characteristic of symptomatic CChMVd-S strains. Only in one case did the GAAA tetraloop emerge and eventually dominate the progeny in infected plants that were non-symptomatic. These results revealed two major fitness peaks in the tetraloop (UUUC and GAAA), whose adjacent stem was also under strong selection pressure. Co-inoculations with CChMVd-S and -NS variants showed that only when the latter was in a 100- or 1000-fold excess did the infected plants remain symptomless, confirming the higher biological fitness of the S variant and explaining the lack of symptom expression previously observed in cross-protection experiments.
