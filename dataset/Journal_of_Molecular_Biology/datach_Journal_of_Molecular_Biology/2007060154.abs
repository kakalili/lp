mapping putative contact sites between subunits in a bacterial atp binding cassette abc transporter by synthetic peptide libraries
the maltose atp binding cassette transporter of salmonella typhimurium is composed of the soluble periplasmic receptor male and a membrane associated complex comprising one copy each of the pore forming hydrophobic subunits malf and malg and of a homodimer of the atp hydrolyzing subunit malk during the transport process the subunits are thought to undergo conformational changes that might transiently alter molecular contacts between malfg and malk  in order to map sites of subunit  subunit interactions we have used a comprehensive peptide mapping approach comprising large scale microsynthesis of labelled probes and array techniques in particular we screened the binding of i malfg derived soluble biotinylated peptides to immobilized malk and ii radiolabelled malk to malfg derived cellulose membrane bound peptides the first approach identified seven peptides  mers each of malf and malg that specifically bound to malk the peptides were localized to tmds  and  periplasmic loop p and cytoplasmic loops c and c of malf while malg derived peptides localized to the n terminus tmds    periplasmic loop p and cytoplasmic loop c  peptides from c and c  respectively of malf and malg partially encompass the conserved eaa motif known to be crucial for interaction with malk these results were basically confirmed by screening malfg derived peptide arrays consisting of  mers or  mers with radiolabelled malk this approach also allowed us to perform complete substitutional analyses of peptides in question the results led to the construction of malfg variants that were subsequently analyzed for functional consequences in vivo growth experiments revealed that most of the mutations had no phenotype suggesting that the mutated residues themselves are not critical but part of a discontinuous binding site however two novel mutations affecting residues from the eaa motifs of malf ile  glu and malg phe  gln asn  respectively displayed severe growth defects indicating their functional importance together these experimental outcomes identify specific molecular contacts made between malk and malfg that extend beyond the well characterized eaa motif
