Positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) stimulates the transition from transcription initiation to productive elongation by phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. P-TEFb consists of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk9 and a T-type cyclin and is regulated by the small nuclear RNA 7SK and the coupling protein Hexim1 or Hexim2. In this study, we analyzed the tripartite protein–RNA complex formation between Hexim, Cyclin T and 7SK snRNA. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we observed higher affinities for Cyclin T1-Hexim1 and Cyclin T2-Hexim2 complex formations compared with the interactions in reverse. Importin α, which is part of the Ran-mediated nuclear import pathway, bound Hexim1 and Hexim2 with dissociation constants of 2.0 and 0.5 μM, respectively. Furthermore, tripartite complex formations between Cyclin T, Hexim and Importin α showed the suitability of a collaborative nuclear import pathway for Cyclin T. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using radioactively labelled full-length 7SK snRNA revealed a tight association of the RNA to Cyclin T1–Hexim1 with dissociation constants lower than 0.3 μM. Similar binding affinities were recorded for both Hexim orthologues to a 66-mer double-stranded 5′ hairpin loop encompassing nucleotides 23–88 of 7SK, while a 39-mer fragment, resulting from different RNA folding predictions, did not bind as tightly. These results provide the molecular basis for the generation of a core complex for the inhibition of P-TEFb.
