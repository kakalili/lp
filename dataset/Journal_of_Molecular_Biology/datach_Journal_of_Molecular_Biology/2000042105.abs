the solution structure of rhodobacter sphaeroides lh  reveals two helical domains separated by a more flexible region structural consequences for the lh complex edited by k nagai
here the solution structure of the rhodobacter sphaeroides core light harvesting complex  polypeptide solubilised in chloroform methanol is presented the structure determined by homonuclear nmr spectroscopy and distance geometry comprises two alpha helical regions residue    to    and    to   using the numbering system in which the conserved histidine residue is numbered zero joined by a more flexible four amino acid residue linker the c terminal helix forms the membrane spanning region in the intact lh complex whilst the n terminal helix must lie in the lipid head groups or in the cytoplasm and form the basis of interaction with the  polypeptide the structure of a mutant  polypeptide w f was also determined this mutant which is deficient in a hydrogen bond donor to the bacteriochlorophyll showed an identical structure to the wild type implying that observed differences in interaction with other lh polypeptides must arise from cofactor binding using these structures we propose a modification to existing models of the intact lh complex by replacing the continuous helix of the  polypeptide with two helices one of which lies at an acute angle to the membrane plane we suggest that a key difference between lh and lh is that the  subunit is more bent in lh  this modification puts the n terminus of lh  close to the reaction centre h subunit and provides a rationale for the different ring sizes of lh and lh complexes
