als causing sod mutations promote production of copper deficient misfolded species
point mutations scattered throughout the sequence of cu zn superoxide dismutase sod  cause a subset of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als cases sod is a homodimer in which each subunit binds one copper atom and one zinc atom inclusions containing misfolded sod are seen in motor neurons of sod associated als cases the mechanism by which these diverse mutations cause misfolding and converge on the same disease is still not well understood previously we developed several time resolved techniques to monitor structural changes in sod as it unfolds in guanidine hydrochloride by measuring the rates of cu and zn release using an absorbance based assay dimer dissociation through chemical cross linking and  barrel conformation changes by tryptophan fluorescence we established that wild type sod unfolds by a branched pathway involving a zn deficient monomer as the dominant intermediate of the major pathway and with various metal loaded and cu deficient dimers populated along the minor pathway we have now compared the unfolding pathway of wild type sod with those of a v g r g r g a and i  t als associated mutant sod  the kinetics of unfolding of the mutants were generally much faster than those of wild type however all of the mutants utilize the minority pathway to a greater extent than the wild type protein leading to greater populations of cu deficient intermediates and decreases in zn deficient intermediates relative to the wild type protein the greater propensity of the mutants to populate cu deficient states potentially implicates these species as a pathogenic form of sod in sod associated als and provides a novel target for therapeutic intervention
