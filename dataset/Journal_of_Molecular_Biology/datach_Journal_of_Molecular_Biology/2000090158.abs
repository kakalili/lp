high density mutagenesis by combined dna shuffling and phage display to assign essential amino acid residues in protein protein interactions application to study structure function of plasminogen activation inhibitor  pai i  edited by j wells
the identification of specific amino acid residues involved in protein protein interaction is fundamental to understanding structure function relationships supported by mathematical calculations we designed a high density mutagenesis procedure for the generation of a mutant library of which a limited number of random clones would suffice to exactly localize amino acid residues essential for a particular protein protein interaction this goal was achieved experimentally by consecutive cycles of dna shuffling under error prone conditions each followed by exposure of the target protein on the surface of phages to screen and select for correctly folded functional mutants to validate the procedure human plasminogen activator inhibitor  pai  was chosen because its d structure is known many experimental tools are available and it may serve as a model protein for structure function studies of serine proteinases and their inhibitors serpins  after five cycles of dna shuffling and selection for t pa binding analysis of  randomly picked clones revealed that pai  mutants contained an average of   amino acid substitutions distributed over   different positions which were preferentially located at the surface of the protein this limited collection of mutant pai  preparations contained multiple mutants defective in binding to three out of four tested anti pai  monoclonal antibodies alignment of the nucleotide sequence of defective clones permitted assignment of single dominant amino acid residues for binding to each monoclonal antibody the importance of these residues was confirmed by testing the properties of single point mutants from the position of these amino acid residues in the d structure of pai  and the effects of the corresponding monoclonal antibodies on t pa pai  interaction conclusions can be drawn with respect to this serpin serine proteinase interaction
