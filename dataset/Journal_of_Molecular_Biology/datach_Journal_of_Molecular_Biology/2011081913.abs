distinct roles of overlapping and non overlapping regions of hub protein interfaces in recognition of multiple partners
cellular functions of an organism are maintained by protein  protein interactions those proteins that bind multiple partners asynchronously date hub proteins are important to make the interaction network coordinated it is known that many date hub proteins bind different partners at overlapping ov interfaces to understand how ov interfaces of date hub proteins can recognize multiple partners we analyzed the difference between ov and non overlapping non ov regions of interfaces involved in the binding of different partners by using the structures of  date hub proteins with various interaction partners ranging from  to   we compared buried surface area compositions of amino acid residues and secondary structures and side chain orientations it was found that buried interface residues are important for recognizing multiple partners while exposed interface residues are important for determining specificity to a particular ligand in addition our analyses reveal that residue compositions in ov and non ov regions are different and that residues in ov region show diverse side chain torsion angles to accommodate binding to multiple targets
