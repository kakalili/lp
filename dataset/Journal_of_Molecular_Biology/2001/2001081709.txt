Protein tyrosine phosphatases PTP-SL and PTPBR7 are isoforms belonging to cytosolic membrane-associated and to receptor-like PTPs (RPTPs), respectively. They represent a new family of PTPs with a major role in activation and translocation of MAP kinases. Specifically, the complex formation between PTP-SL and ERK2 involves an unusual interaction leading to the phosphorylation of PTP-SL by ERK2 at Thr253 and the inactivating dephosphorylation of ERK2 by PTP-SL. This interaction is strictly dependent upon a kinase interaction motif (KIM) (residues 224–239) situated at the N terminus of the PTP-SL catalytic domain. We report the first crystal structure of the catalytic domain for a member of this family (PTP-SL, residues 254–549, identical with residues 361–656 of PTPBR7), providing an example of an RPTP with single cytoplasmic domain, which is monomeric, having an unhindered catalytic site. In addition to the characteristic PTP-core structure, PTP-SL has an N-terminal helix, possibly orienting the KIM motif upon interaction with the target ERK2. An unusual residue in the catalytically important WPD loop promotes formation of a hydrophobically and electrostatically stabilised clamp. This could induce increased rigidity to the WPD loop and therefore reduced catalytic activity, in agreement with our kinetic measurements. A docking model based on the PTP-SL structure suggests that, in the complex with ERK2, the phosphorylation of PTP-SL should be accomplished first. The subsequent dephosphorylation of ERK2 seems to be possible only if a conformational rearrangement of the two interacting partners takes place.
