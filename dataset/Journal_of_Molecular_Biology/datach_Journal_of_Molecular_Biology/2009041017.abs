pbp active site flexibility as the key mechanism for  lactam resistance in pneumococci
penicillin binding proteins pbps  the main targets of  lactam antibiotics are membrane associated enzymes that catalyze the two last steps in the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan in streptococcus pneumoniae a major human pathogen the surge in resistance to such antibiotics is a direct consequence of the proliferation of mosaic pbp encoding genes which give rise to proteins containing tens of mutations pbp b is a major drug resistance target and its modification is essential for the development of high levels of resistance to piperacillin in this work we have solved the crystal structures of pbp b from a wild type pneumococcal strain as well as from a highly drug resistant clinical isolate displaying  mutations although mutations are present throughout the entire pbp structure those surrounding the active site influence the total charge and the polar character of the region while those in close proximity to the catalytic nucleophile impart flexibility onto the     loop area which encapsulates the cleft the wealth of structural data on pneumococcal pbps now underlines the importance of high malleability in active site regions of drug resistant strains suggesting that active site  breathing  could be a common mechanism employed by this pathogen to prevent targeting by  lactams
