the    crystal structure of sphericase a calcium loaded serine protease from bacillus sphaericus
we have previously isolated sphericase sph  an extracellular mesophilic serine protease produced by bacillus sphaericus the sph amino acid sequence is highly homologous to two cold adapted subtilisins from antarctic bacilli s  and s    and   identity respectively  sph is calcium dependent   amino acid residues long and has optimal activity at ph    s  and s  have not as yet been structurally analysed in the present work we determined the crystal structure of sph by the eu multiwavelength anomalous diffraction method the structure was extended to    resolution and refined to a crystallographic r factor of    the final model included all   amino acid residues one disulfide bond   water molecules and five calcium ions although sph is a mesophilic subtilisin its amino acid sequence is similar to that of the psychrophilic subtilisins which suggests that the crystal structure of these subtilisins is very similar the presence of five calcium ions bound to a subtilisin molecule as found here for sph has not been reported for the subtilisin superfamily none of these calcium binding sites correlates with the well known high affinity calcium binding site site i or site a  and only one site has been described previously this calcium binding pattern suggests that a reduction in the flexibility of the surface loops of sph by calcium binding may be responsible for its adaptation to mesophilic organisms
