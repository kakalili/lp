Nucleotide incorporation during transcription by RNA polymerase is accompanied by pyrophosphate formation. Rapid release of pyrophosphate from the elongation complex at a rate consistent with productive transcription elongation occurs only in the presence of the correct next nucleotide for incorporation into the transcript.
