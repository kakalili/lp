characterization of the interaction between diferric transferrin and transferrin receptor  by functional assays and atomic force microscopy
transferrin receptor  tfr  a homologue of the classical transferrin receptor  tfr  is found in two isoforms   and   like tfr  tfr  is a type ii membrane protein but the  form lacks transmembrane portions and therefore is likely to be an intracellular protein to investigate the functional properties of tfr   we expressed the protein with flag tagging in transferrin receptor deficient chinese hamster ovary cells the association constant for the binding of diferric transferrin tf to tfr  is      m   which is about  times lower than that for the binding of tf to tfr  with correspondingly reduced rates of iron uptake evidence for tf internalization and recycling via tfr  without degradation as in the tfr pathway was also found the interaction of tfr  with tf was further investigated using atomic force microscopy a powerful tool used for investigating the interaction between a ligand and its receptor at the single molecule level on the living cell surface dynamic force microscopy reveals a difference in the interactions of tf with tfr  and tfr  with tf  tfr unbinding characterized by two energy barriers while only one is present for tf  tfr  we speculate that this difference may reflect tf binding to tfr  by a single lobe whereas two lobes of tf participate in binding to tfr  the difference in the binding properties of tf to tfr and tfr  may help account for the different physiological roles of the two receptors
