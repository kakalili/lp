methylthiopentose a new substituent on lipoarabinomannan in mycobacterium tuberculosis edited by j karn
we have identified and characterised in several strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis a new  methylthiopentose substituent on lipoarabinomannan lam  the  methylthiopentose was initially observed in heteronuclear h  c nmr spectra of intact  c enriched lam oligosaccharides carrying this substituent were released from  c enriched lam and from unlabelled lam using an endo arabinanase from cellulomonas gellida the presence of the methylthio group in these oligosaccharides was established using nmr high resolution fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry using a q tof mass spectrometer the  methylthiopentose is linked to a terminal mannose in the cap structures of these oligosaccharides as evidenced by tandem mass spectrometry and by nmr we suggest interference with the signal transduction mechanisms of infected macrophages as a possible function for this newly discovered lam substituent
