extensive central disruption of a four way junction on binding cce resolving enzyme edited by m yaniv
junction resolving enzymes are nucleases that are selective for the structure of the four way dna junction that is important in genetic recombination they exhibit selectivity for the structure of the junction but they also manipulate the structure local disruption of dna structure around the centre of the junction by cce of saccharomyces cerevisiae has been investigated using  aminopurine fluorescence on binding cce   aminopurine bases located at the point of strand exchange exhibit a large increase in fluorescence intensity up to  fold enhancement  consistent with complete unstacking this was observed for all positions around the centre of the junction both   and   to the point of strand exchange thymine bases complementary to the modified adenine bases adjacent to the junction centre were strongly reactive to potassium permanganate the results indicate that binding of cce results in a complete unpairing of the four central base pairs of the junction with a lesser disruption of the next base pairs
