in situ atomic force microscopy study of  amyloid fibrillization edited by m f moody
we report the use of atomic force microscopy to observe the initial stages of  amyloid fibrillization in situ the growth of individual  amyloid protofibrils on a mica substrate was followed over several hours the first in situ visualization of protofibril formation from single aggregate units of  amyloid is reported the growth of these protofibrils through the subsequent addition of these aggregate units is also observed growth of the protofibrils is bi directional and the outgrowth of protofibrils from a common amyloid heterogeneous core is also observed elongation also occurred by the addition of protofibrils from solution this data provides an exciting insight into the early stages of  amyloid fibrillization and can be used to enhance the understanding of the mechanism s by which  amyloid fibrillizes and may consequently enable inhibition of one or more stages of fibrillization as a potential therapeutic strategy
