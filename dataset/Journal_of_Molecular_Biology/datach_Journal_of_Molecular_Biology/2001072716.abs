recognition of nucleotide g  in  s ribosomal rna by the rrma methyltransferase edited by d draper
methylation of the n position of nucleotide g  in hairpin  of escherichia coli  s ribosomal rna rrna is mediated by the methyltransferase enzyme rrma lack of g  methylation results in reduced rates of protein synthesis and growth addition of recombinant plasmid encoded rrma to an rrma deficient strain remedies these defects recombinant rrma was purified and shown to retain its activity and specificity for  s rrna in vitro the recombinant enzyme was used to define the structures in the rrna that are necessary for the methyltransferase reaction progressive truncation of the rrna substrate shows that structures in stem loops    and  are required for methylation by rrma multiple contacts between nucleotides in these stem loops and rrma were confirmed in footprinting experiments no other rrma contact was evident elsewhere in the rrna the rrma contact sites on the rrna are inaccessible in ribosomal particles and consistent with this   s subunits or  s ribosomes are not substrates for rrma methylation rrma resembles the homologous methyltransferase tlrb specific for nucleotide g   as well as the erm methyltransferases nucleotide a    in that all these enzymes methylate their target nucleotides only in the free rna after assembly of the  s subunit nucleotides g   g  and a   come to lie in close proximity lining the peptide exit channel at the site where macrolide lincosamide and streptogramin b antibiotics bind
