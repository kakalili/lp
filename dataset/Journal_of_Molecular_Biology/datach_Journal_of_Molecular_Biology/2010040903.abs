structural basis of human cyp  inhibition by antifungal azoles
the obligatory step in sterol biosynthesis in eukaryotes is demethylation of sterol precursors at the c  position which is catalyzed by cyp  sterol  alpha demethylase in three sequential reactions in mammals the final product of the pathway is cholesterol while important intermediates meiosis activating sterols are produced by cyp  three crystal structures of human cyp  ligand free and complexed with antifungal drugs ketoconazole and econazole were determined allowing analysis of the molecular basis for functional conservation within the cyp  family azole binding occurs mostly through hydrophobic interactions with conservative residues of the active site the substantial conformational changes in the b  helix and f  g loop regions are induced upon ligand binding consistent with the membrane nature of the protein and its substrate the access channel is typical for mammalian sterol metabolizing p  enzymes but is different from that observed in mycobacterium tuberculosis cyp  comparison of the azole bound structures provides insight into the relative binding affinities of human and bacterial p  enzymes to ketoconazole and fluconazole which can be useful for the rational design of antifungal compounds and specific modulators of human cyp
