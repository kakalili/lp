analysis of a fance splice isoform in regard to dna repair
the fanc brca dna repair pathway is activated in response to interstrand crosslinks formed in dna a homozygous mutation in  of the  fanconi anemia fa genes results in malfunctions of this pathway and development of fa syndrome the integrity of this protein network is essential for good maintenance of dna repair process and genome stability following the identification of an alternatively splice isoform of fance fanconi anemia complementation group e significantly expressed in breast cancer individuals from high risk non brca  families we studied the impact of this fance splice isoform fance   on dna repair processes we have demonstrated that fance  mrna was efficiently translated into a functional protein and expressed in normal and breast cancer cell lines following treatment with the crosslinking agent mitomycin c eufa   fance deficient cells infected with fance  were blocked into g m phase while cell survival was significantly reduced compared with fance infected eufa  cells in addition fance  did not allow fancd and fanci monoubiquitination which represents a crucial step of the fanc brca functional pathway as observed for fance wild type protein localization of fance  protein was confined to the nucleus following mitomycin c treatment although fance  protein showed interaction with fance fance  did not support normal function of fance protein in this pathway and could have deleterious effects on fance protein activity we have demonstrated that fance  seems to act as a regulator of fancd protein expression level by promoting its degradation this study highlights the importance of an efficient regulation of alternative splicing expression of fa genes for proper dna repair
