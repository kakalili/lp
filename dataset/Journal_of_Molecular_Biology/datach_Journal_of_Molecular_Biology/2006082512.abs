an episulfide cation thiiranium ring trapped in the active site of hav c proteinase inactivated by peptide based ketone inhibitors
we have solved the crystal and molecular structures of hepatitis a viral hav  c proteinase a cysteine peptidase having a chymotrypsin like protein fold in complex with each of three tetrapeptidyl based methyl ketone inhibitors to resolutions beyond     the highest resolution to date for a c or a c like e g sars viral main proteinase peptidase the residues of the  hairpin motif residues       an extension of two  strands of the c terminal  barrel of hav c are critical for the interactions between the enzyme and the tetrapeptide portion of these inhibitors that are analogous to the residues at the p to p positions in the natural substrates of picornaviral c proteinases unexpectedly the s  of cys  forms two covalent bonds with each inhibitor yielding an unusual episulfide cation thiiranium ring stabilized by a nearby oxyanion this result suggests a mechanism of inactivation of c peptidases by methyl ketone inhibitors that is distinct from that occurring in the structurally related serine proteinases or in the papain like cysteine peptidases it also provides insight into the mechanisms underlying both the inactivation of hav c by these inhibitors and on the proteolysis of natural substrates by this viral cysteine peptidase
