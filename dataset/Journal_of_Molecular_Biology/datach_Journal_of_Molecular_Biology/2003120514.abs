the crystal structure of murine cmp  n acetylneuraminic acid synthetase
sialic acids are activated by cmp  n acetylneuraminic acid synthetase prior to their transfer onto oligo or polysaccharides here we present the crystal structure of the n terminal catalytically active domain of the murine  n acetylneuraminic acid synthetase in complex with the reaction product in contrast to the previously solved structure of  n acetylneuraminic acid synthetase from neisseria meningitidis and the related cmp  kdo synthetase of escherichia coli the murine enzyme is a tetramer which was observed with the active sites closed in this conformation a loop is shifted by   towards the active site and thus an essential arginine residue can participate in catalysis furthermore a network of intermolecular salt bridges and hydrogen bonds in the dimer as well as hydrophobic interfaces between two dimers indicate a cooperative behaviour of the enzyme in addition a complex regulation of the enzyme activity is proposed that includes phosphorylation and dephosphorylation
