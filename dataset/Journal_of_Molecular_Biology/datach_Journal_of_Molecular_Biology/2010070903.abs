horse prion protein nmr structure and comparisons with related variants of the mouse prion protein
the nmr structure of the horse equus caballus cellular prion protein at    c exhibits the typical prpc cellular form of prion protein prp  global architecture but in contrast to most other mammalian prpcs it contains a well structured loop connecting the   strand with the   helix comparison with designed variants of the mouse prion protein resulted in the identification of a single amino acid exchange within the loop d  s which correlates with the high structural order of this loop in the solution structure at    c and is unique to the prp sequences of equine species the      loop and the   helix form a protein surface epitope that has been proposed to be the recognition area for a hypothetical chaperone   protein x   which would promote conversion of prpc into the disease related scrapie form and thus mediate intermolecular interactions related to the transmission barrier for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies tses between different species the present results are evaluated in light of recent indications from in vivo experiments that the local      loop structure affects the susceptibility of transgenic mice to tses and the fact that there are no reports on tse in horses
