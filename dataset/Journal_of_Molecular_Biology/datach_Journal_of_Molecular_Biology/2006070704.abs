the mitomycin c mmc binding protein from mmc producing microorganisms protects from the lethal effect of bleomycin crystallographic analysis to elucidate the binding mode of the antibiotic to the protein
antibiotic producing microorganisms must be protected from the lethal effect of their own antibiotic we have previously determined the x ray crystal structure of the bleomycin bm binding protein designated blma as a self resistance determinant from bm producing streptomyces verticillus which suggests that the binding of the first bm to one of two pockets formed in the blma homodimer induces the cooperative binding of the second bm to the other pocket in the present study we noticed that the x ray crystallographic structure of a self resistance determinant from a mitomycin c producing microorganism designated mrdp reveals similarity to the folding pattern on the blma although no sequence homology exists to clarify the hypothesis that mrdp may function as a resistance determinant to bm we characterized and determined the crystal structure of mrdp complexed with the cu ii bound form of bma grouped into the bm family of antibiotics the biochemical and structural studies for bm binding provide evidence that the first bm binds anti cooperatively to a pocket of mrdp with binding affinity of the nanomolar order whereas the second bm binds to the other pocket which has binding affinity of the micromolar order the invisibility of the second bm in the structure agrees with the observation that escherichia coli expressing mrdp displays lower resistance to bm than that expressing blma the structure of mrdp which is complexed with the cu ii bound bma  revealed that the  aminopropyldimethylsulphonium moiety of the antibiotic is sandwiched between the peripheral residues of the binding pocket and that its positively charged sulphonium head is accommodated completely in the negatively charged region of the mrdp pocket furthermore the cu ii bound bma has a very compact structure in which the bithiazole ring of bma is folded back to the metal binding domain
