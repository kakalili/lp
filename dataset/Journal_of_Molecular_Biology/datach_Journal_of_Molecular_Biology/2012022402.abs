conformational dynamics of a membrane transport protein probed by h d exchange and covalent labeling the glycerol facilitator
glycerol facilitator gf is a tetrameric membrane protein responsible for the selective permeation of glycerol and water each of the four gf subunits forms a transmembrane channel every subunit consists of six helices that completely span the lipid bilayer as well as two half helices tm and tm  x ray crystallography has revealed that the selectivity of gf is due to its unique amphipathic channel interior to explore the structural dynamics of gf we employ hydrogen deuterium exchange hdx and oxidative labeling with mass spectrometry ms  hdx ms reveals that transmembrane helices are generally more protected than extramembrane segments consistent with data previously obtained for other membrane proteins interestingly tm does not follow this trend instead this half helix undergoes rapid deuteration indicative of a highly dynamic local structure the oxidative labeling behavior of most gf residues is consistent with the static crystal structure however the side chains of c  and m  undergo labeling although they should be inaccessible according to the x ray structure in agreement with our hdx ms data this observation attests to the fact that tm is only marginally stable we propose that the highly mobile nature of tm aids in the efficient diffusion of guest molecules through the channel   molecular lubrication   in the absence of such dynamics host  guest molecular recognition would favor semipermanent binding of molecules inside the channel thereby impeding transport the current work highlights the complementary nature of hdx covalent labeling and x ray crystallography for the characterization of membrane proteins
