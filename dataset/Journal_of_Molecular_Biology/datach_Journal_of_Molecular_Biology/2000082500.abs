structural basis of carbohydrate recognition by lectin ii from ulex europaeus a protein with a promiscuous carbohydrate binding site edited by r huber
protein carbohydrate interactions are the language of choice for inter cellular communication the legume lectins form a large family of homologous proteins that exhibit a wide variety of carbohydrate specificities the legume lectin family is therefore highly suitable as a model system to study the structural principles of protein carbohydrate recognition until now structural data are only available for two specificity families man glc and gal galnac no structural data are available for any of the fucose or chitobiose specific lectins the crystal structure of ulex europaeus uea ii is the first of a legume lectin belonging to the chitobiose specificity group the complexes with n acetylglucosamine galactose and fucosylgalactose show a promiscuous primary binding site capable of accommodating both n acetylglucos amine or galactose in the primary binding site the hydrogen bonding network in these complexes can be considered suboptimal in agreement with the low affinities of these sugars in the complexes with chitobiose lactose and fucosyllactose this suboptimal hydrogen bonding network is compensated by extensive hydrophobic interactions in a glc glcnac binding subsite uea ii thus forms the first example of a legume lectin with a promiscuous binding site and illustrates the importance of hydrophobic interactions in protein carbohydrate complexes together with other known legume lectin crystal structures it shows how different specificities can be grafted upon a conserved structural framework
