a small molecule probe induces a conformation in hiv tar rna capable of binding drug like fragments
the hiv  transactivation response tar element  tat interaction is a potentially valuable target for treating hiv infection but efforts to develop tar binding antiviral drugs have not yet yielded a successful candidate for clinical development in this work we describe a novel approach toward screening fragments against rna that uses a chemical probe to target the tat binding region of tar this probe fulfills two critical roles in the screen by locking the rna into a conformation capable of binding other fragments it simultaneously allows the identification of proximal binding fragments by ligand based nmr using this approach we have discovered six novel tar binding fragments three of which were docked relative to the probe  rna structure using experimental nmr restraints the consistent orientations of functional groups in our data driven docked structures and common electrostatic properties across all fragment leads reveal a surprising level of selectivity by our fragment sized screening hits these models further suggest linking strategies for the development of higher affinity lead compounds for the inhibition of the tar  tat interaction
