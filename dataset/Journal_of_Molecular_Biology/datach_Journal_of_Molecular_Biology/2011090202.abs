the overall architecture and receptor binding of pneumococcal carbohydrate antigen hydrolyzing enzymes
the tigr and sp bs  strains of streptococcus pneumoniae each produce family  glycoside hydrolases called sp gh  and sp gh  respectively which have different modular architectures and substrate specificities sp gh  degrades the lewisy antigen and possesses three c terminal family  carbohydrate binding modules cbms that bind to this substrate sp gh  degrades the blood group a b antigens and has two n terminal family  cbms that are of unknown function here we examine the complex carbohydrate binding specificity of the family  cbms from sp gh  referred to as cbm   and cbm    the structural basis of this interaction and the overall solution conformations of both sp gh  and sp gh  which are shown to be fully secreted proteins through glycan microarray binding analysis and isothermal titration calorimetry cbm   is found to bind specifically to the blood group a b antigens however due to a series of relatively small structural rearrangements that were revealed in structures determined by x ray crystallography cbm   appears to be incapable of binding carbohydrates analysis of small angle x ray scattering data in combination with the available high resolution x ray crystal structures of the sp gh  and sp gh  catalytic modules and their cbms yielded models of the biological solution structures of the full length enzymes these studies reveal the complex architectures of the two enzymes and suggest that carbohydrate recognition by the cbms and the activity of the catalytic modules are not directly coupled
