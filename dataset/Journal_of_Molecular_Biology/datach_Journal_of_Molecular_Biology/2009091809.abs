crystal structure of dicamba monooxygenase a rieske nonheme oxygenase that catalyzes oxidative demethylation
dicamba   dichloro  methoxybenzoic acid is a widely used herbicide that is efficiently degraded by soil microbes these microbes use a novel rieske nonheme oxygenase dicamba monooxygenase dmo  to catalyze the oxidative demethylation of dicamba to   dichlorosalicylic acid dcsa and formaldehyde we have determined the crystal structures of dmo in the free state bound to its substrate dicamba and bound to the product dcsa at         resolution the structures show that the dmo active site uses a combination of extensive hydrogen bonding and steric interactions to correctly orient chlorinated ortho substituted benzoic acid like substrates for catalysis unlike other rieske aromatic oxygenases dmo oxygenates the exocyclic methyl group rather than the aromatic ring of its substrate this first crystal structure of a rieske demethylase shows that the rieske oxygenase structural scaffold can be co opted to perform varied types of reactions on xenobiotic substrates
