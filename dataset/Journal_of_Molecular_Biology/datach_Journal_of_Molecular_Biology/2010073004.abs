p aeruginosa pilt structures with and without nucleotide reveal a dynamic type iv pilus retraction motor
type iv pili are bacterial extracellular filaments that can be retracted to create force and motility retraction is accomplished by the motor protein pilt crystal structures of pseudomonas aeruginosa pilt with and without bound    methyleneadenosine   triphosphate have been solved at     and     resolution respectively revealing an interlocking hexamer formed by the action of a crystallographic  fold symmetry operator on three subunits in the asymmetric unit and held together by extensive ionic interactions the roles of two invariant carboxylates asp box motif glu  and walker b motif glu   have been assigned to mg  binding and catalysis respectively the nucleotide ligands in each of the subunits in the asymmetric unit of the    methyleneadenosine   triphosphate bound pilt are not equally well ordered similarly the three subunits in the asymmetric unit of both structures exhibit differing relative conformations of the two domains the   and   domain rotations indicate motions that occur during the atp coupled mechanism of the disassembly of pili into membrane localized pilin monomers integrating these observations we propose a three state  ready active release  model for the action of pilt
