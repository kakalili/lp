a two site mechanism for the inhibition of iapp amyloidogenesis by zinc
human islet amyloid polypeptide hiapp is a highly amyloidogenic protein co secreted with insulin in response to glucose levels the formation of hiapp amyloid plaques near islet cells has been linked to the death of insulin secreting  cells in humans and the progression of type ii diabetes since both healthy individuals and those with type ii diabetes produce and secrete hiapp it is reasonable to look for factors involved in storing hiapp and preventing amyloidosis we have previously shown that zinc inhibits the formation of insoluble amyloid plaques of hiapp however there remains significant ambiguity in the underlying mechanisms in this study we show that zinc binds unaggregated hiapp at micromolar concentrations similar to those found in the extracellular environment by contrast the fibrillar amyloid form of hiapp has low affinity for zinc the binding stoichiometry obtained from isothermal titration calorimetry experiments indicates that zinc favors the formation of hiapp hexamers high resolution nmr structures of hiapp bound to zinc reveal changes in the electron environment along residues that would be located along one face of the amphipathic hiapp  helix proposed as an intermediate for amyloid formation results from electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy investigations showed that a single zinc atom is predominantly bound to hiapp and revealed that zinc inhibits the formation of the dimer at higher concentrations of zinc a second zinc atom binds to hiapp suggesting the presence of a low affinity secondary binding site combined these results suggest that zinc promotes the formation of oligomers while creating an energetic barrier for the formation of amyloid fibers
