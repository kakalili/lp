novel essential gene involved in  s rrna processing in escherichia coli
biogenesis of ribosomes is a complex process mediated by many factors while its transcription proceeds ribosomal rna rrna folds itself into a characteristic three dimensional structure through interaction with ribosomal proteins during which its ends are processed here we show that the essential protein yqgf a ruvc family protein with an rnase h like motif is involved in the processing of pre  s rrna during ribosome maturation indeed pre  s rrna accumulated in cells of a temperature sensitive yqgf mutant yqgfts cultured at a non permissive temperature in addition purified yqgf was shown to process the   end of pre  s rrna within  s ribosomes in vitro mass spectrometry analysis of the total proteins in the yqgfts mutant cells showed that the expression of genes containing multiple shine  dalgarno like sequences was observed to be lower than in wild type these results are interpreted to indicate that yqgf is involved in a novel enzymic activity necessary for the processing of pre  s rrna thereby affecting elongation of translation
