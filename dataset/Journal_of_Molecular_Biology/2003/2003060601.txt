HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein NCp7 is a small basic protein with two zinc fingers, found in the virion core where several hundred molecules coat the genomic RNA. NCp7 has nucleic acid chaperone properties that guide reverse transcriptase (RT) to synthesize the proviral DNA flanked by the long terminal repeats (LTR). In vitro, NCp7 can strongly activate magnesium-dependent LTR-DNA strand transfer by integrase (IN). Here we show that IN activation relies on both the basic residues and the zinc fingers of NCp7. NCp7 lacking the zinc fingers binds DNA but moderately stimulates strand transfer by IN. The NCp7 zinc-finger domain binds DNA poorly and does not efficiently stimulate IN activity. However, the NC zinc-finger domain can complement DNA binding to restore full activation of strand transfer by IN. We propose that the basic residues and the zinc fingers function together to stabilize IN at the LTR ends and promote the formation of a nucleoprotein complex competent for integration. We also show that these properties of HIV-1 NCp7 are remarkably conserved among nucleocapsid proteins of retrotransposon and retrovirus origins.
