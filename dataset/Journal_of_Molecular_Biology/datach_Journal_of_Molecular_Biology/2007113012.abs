structural and thermodynamic insights into the assembly of the heteromeric pyridoxal phosphate synthase from plasmodium falciparum
pyridoxal   phosphate plp is required as a cofactor by many enzymes the predominant de novo biosynthetic route is catalyzed by a heteromeric glutamine amidotransferase consisting of the synthase subunit pdx and the glutaminase subunit pdx  previously bacillus subtilis plp synthase was studied by x ray crystallography and complex assembly had been characterized by isothermal titration calorimetry the fully assembled plp synthase complex contains  individual pdx pdx glutamine amidotransferase heterodimers these studies revealed the occurrence of an encounter complex that is tightened in the michaelis complex when the substrate l glutamine binds in this study we have characterized complex formation of plp synthase from the malaria causing human pathogen plasmodium falciparum using isothermal titration calorimetry the presence of l glutamine increases the tightness of the interaction about  fold and alters the thermodynamic signature of complex formation the thermodynamic data are integrated in a d homology model of p falciparum plp synthase the negative experimental heat capacity cp describes a protein interface that is dominated by hydrophobic interactions in the absence of l glutamine the experimental cp is less negative than in its presence contrasting to the previously characterised bacterial plp synthase thus while the encounter complexes differ the michaelis complexes of plasmodial and bacterial systems have similar characteristics concerning the relative contribution of apolar polar surface area in addition we have verified the role of the n terminal region of pfpdx for complex formation a  swap mutant  in which the complete  n helix of plasmodial pdx was exchanged with the corresponding segment from b subtilis shows cross binding to b subtilis pdx  the swap mutant also partially elicits glutaminase activity in bspdx  demonstrating that formation of the protein complex interface via  n and catalytic activation of the glutaminase are linked processes
