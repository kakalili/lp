quaternary structure of a mature amyloid fibril from alzheimer  s a     peptide
amyloid fibrils are fibrous polypeptide aggregates that can be formed in vitro and under pathologic conditions such as in type ii diabetes alzheimer s and creutzfeldt jakob diseases using a range of biophysical techniques including electron microscopy we have analysed the quaternary structure of a mature amyloid fibril formed from the a     peptide from alzheimer s disease we find that the analysed fibril is discernibly polar and represents a left handed helix consisting of two or three protofilaments these are organised in a manner so that the cross section is under the present resolution conditions    nm  s shaped in the cross section each protofilament can accommodate two  strands suggesting that each protofilament contains two cross  sheets these data shed new light on the way in which a     and the protofilaments formed from this peptide are organised within the mature fibril
