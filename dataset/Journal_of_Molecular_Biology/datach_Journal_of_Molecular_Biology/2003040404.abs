extending the understanding of mutagenicity structural insights into primer extension past a benzo a pyrene diol epoxide dna adduct
dna polymerase enzymes employ a number of innate fidelity mechanisms to ensure the faithful replication of the genome however when confronted with dna damage their fidelity mechanisms can be evaded resulting in a mutation that may contribute to the carcinogenic process the environmental carcinogen benzo a pyrene is metabolically activated to reactive intermediates including the tumorigenic   anti benzo a pyrene diol epoxide which can attack dna at the exocyclic amino group of guanine to form the major   trans anti bp n dg adduct bulky adducts such as   trans anti bp n dg primarily block dna replication but are occasionally bypassed and cause mutations if paired with an incorrect base in vitro standing start primer extension assays show that the preferential insertion of a opposite   trans anti bp n dg is independent of the sequence context but the primer is extended preferentially when dt is positioned opposite the damaged base in a   cg  t   sequence context regardless of the base positioned opposite   trans anti bp n dg extension of the primer past the lesion site poses the greatest block to polymerase progression in order to gain insight into primer extension of each base opposite   trans anti bp n dg we carried out molecular modeling and   ns unrestrained molecular dynamics simulations of the adduct in the  position of the template within the replicative pol i family t dna polymerase each of the four bases was modeled at the   terminus of the primer incorporated opposite the adduct and the next to be replicated base was in the active site with its watson  crick partner as the incoming nucleotide as in our studies of nucleotide incorporation   trans anti bp n dg was modeled in the syn conformation in the  position with the bp moiety on the open major groove side of the primer  template duplex region leaving critical protein  dna interactions intact the present work revealed that the efficiency of primer extension past this bulky adduct opposite each of the four bases in the   cg  t   sequence can be rationalized by the stability of interactions between the polymerase protein primer  template dna and incoming nucleotide however the relative stabilization of each nucleotide opposite   trans anti bp n dg in the  position t gt g gt a  c differed from that when the adduct and partner were the nascent base pair a gt t  g gt c  in addition extension past   trans anti bp n dg may pose a greater block to a high fidelity dna polymerase than does nucleotide incorporation opposite the adduct because the presence of the modified base pair in the  position is more disruptive to the polymerase  dna interactions than it is within the active site itself the dn   trans anti bp n dg base pair is strained to shield the bulky aromatic bp moiety from contact with the solvent in the  position causing disruption of protein  dna interactions that would likely result in decreased extension of the base pair these studies reveal in molecular detail the kinds of specific structural interactions that determine the function of a processive dna polymerase when challenged by a bulky dna adduct
