the zinc center influences the redox and thermodynamic properties of escherichia coli thioredoxin
thioredoxins are small ubiquitous redox enzymes that reduce protein disulfide bonds by using a pair of cysteine residues present in a strictly conserved wcgpc catalytic motif the escherichia coli cytoplasm contains two thioredoxins trx and trx  trx is special because it is induced under oxidative stress conditions and it has an additional n terminal zinc binding domain we have determined the redox potential of trx  the pka of the active site nucleophilic cysteine as well as the stability of the oxidized and reduced form of the protein trx is more oxidizing than trx      mv versus     mv respectively  which is in good agreement with the decreased value of the pka of the nucleophilic cysteine   versus   respectively  the difference in stability between the oxidized and reduced forms of an oxidoreductase is the driving force to reduce substrate proteins this difference is smaller for trx    g h o  kj mol and  tm     c than for trx    g h o  kj mol and  tm    c  altogether our data indicate that trx is a significantly less reducing enzyme than trx  which suggests that trx has a distinctive function we disrupted the zinc center by mutating the four zn  binding cysteines to serine this mutant has a more reducing redox potential     mv and the pka of its nucleophilic cysteine shifts from   to   the removal of zn  also decreases the overall stability of the reduced and oxidized forms by   kj mol and   kj mol respectively in conclusion our data show that the zn  center of trx fine tunes the properties of this unique thioredoxin
