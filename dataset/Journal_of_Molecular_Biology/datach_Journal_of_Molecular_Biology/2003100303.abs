identification of substrate binding sites in enzymes by computational solvent mapping
enzyme structures determined in organic solvents show that most organic molecules cluster in the active site delineating the binding pocket we have developed algorithms to perform solvent mapping computationally rather than experimentally by placing molecular probes small molecules or functional groups on a protein surface and finding the regions with the most favorable binding free energy the method then finds the consensus site that binds the highest number of different probes the probe  protein interactions at this site are compared to the intermolecular interactions seen in the known complexes of the enzyme with various ligands substrate analogs products and inhibitors  we have mapped thermolysin for which experimental mapping results are also available and six further enzymes that have no experimental mapping data but whose binding sites are well characterized with the exception of haloalkane dehalogenase which binds very small substrates in a narrow channel the consensus site found by the mapping is always a major subsite of the substrate binding site furthermore the probes at this location form hydrogen bonds and non bonded interactions with the same residues that interact with the specific ligands of the enzyme thus once the structure of an enzyme is known computational solvent mapping can provide detailed and reliable information on its substrate binding site calculations on ligand bound and apo structures of enzymes show that the mapping results are not very sensitive to moderate variations in the protein coordinates
