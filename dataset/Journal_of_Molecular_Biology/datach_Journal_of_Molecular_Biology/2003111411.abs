gelsolin domain  ca  affinity determines susceptibility to furin proteolysis and familial amyloidosis of finnish type
mutation of aspartic acid   to asparagine d  n or tyrosine d  y in domain  of the actin modulating protein gelsolin causes the neurodegenerative disease familial amyloidosis of finnish type faf  these mutations render plasma gelsolin susceptible to aberrant proteolysis by furin in the trans golgi network the initial proteolytic event in the formation of  and  residue fragments that assemble into amyloid fibrils ca  binding stabilizes wild type domain  gelsolin against denaturation and proteolysis but the faf variants are unable to bind and be stabilized by ca  though the chain of events initiating faf has been elucidated recently uncertainty remains about the mechanistic details that allow the faf variants to be processed to test the hypothesis that impaired ca  binding in the d  variants but not other factors specific to residue   increases susceptibility to aberrant proteolysis and subsequent amyloidogenesis we designed the gelsolin variant e  q to remove a different ca  ligand from the same ca  site that is affected in the faf variants here we show that e  q domain  does not bind ca  and is not stabilized against denaturation or furin proteolysis analogous to the behavior exhibited by the faf variants transfection of full length e  q into cos cells results in secretion of both the full length and furin processed fragments as observed with d  n and d  y mutation of the furin consensus sequence in d  n and e  q gelsolin prevents cleavage during secretion indicating that inhibition of proprotein convertases furin represents a viable therapeutic approach for the treatment of faf mutations that diminish domain  ca  binding allow furin access to an otherwise protected cleavage site initiating the proteolytic cascade that leads to gelsolin amyloidogenesis and faf
