exclusion of glucosyl hydroxymethylcytosine dna containing bacteriophages is overcome by the injected protein inhibitor ipi
the escherichia coli isolate ct  excludes infection by the myoviridae t ip   phage that lacks the encapsidated ipi protein normally injected into the host with the phage dna screening of a ct  genomic library identified adjacent genes responsible for this exclusion gmrs    bp and gmrd    bp that are encoded by a cryptic prophage dna the two genes are necessary and sufficient to confer upon a host the ability to exclude infection by t ip   phage and other glucosyl hydroxymethylcytosine glc hmc tevens lacking the ip gene yet allow infection by phages with non glucoslyated cytosine c dna that lack the ip gene a plasmid expressing the ip gene product ipi  allows growth of tevens lacking ip on e coli strains carrying the cloned gmrs gmrd genes members of the teven family carry a diverse and in some cases expanded set of ip locus genes in vivo analysis suggests a family of gmr genes that specifically target sugar hmc modified dna have evolved to exclude teven phages and these exclusion genes have in turn been countered by a family of injected exclusion inhibitors that likely help determine the host range of different glc hmc phages
