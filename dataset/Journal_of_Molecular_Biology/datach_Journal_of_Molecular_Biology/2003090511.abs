small highly structured rnas participate in the conversion of human recombinant prpsen to prpresin vitro
we have identified a small highly structured shs rna that binds human recombinant prion protein hrprp with high affinity and specificity under physiological conditions e g   bovine calf serum bcs  neutral ph nanomolar concentrations of rna and hrprp  we also demonstrate the ability of this shsrna to form highly stable nucleoprotein complexes with hrprp and cellular prp prpc from various cell extracts and mammalian brain homogenates the apparent mass of the nucleoprotein complex is dependent on the molar ratio of hrprp to rna during complex formation the hrprp in these complexes acquires resistance to degradation by proteinase k pk  other shsrnas however under identical conditions neither form stable complexes with hrprp nor do they induce resistance to pk digestion we also demonstrate that the rnas in these nucleoprotein complexes become resistant to ribonuclease a hydrolysis these interactions between shsrnas and hrprp suggest possible roles of rnas in the modulation of prp structure and perhaps disease development shsrnas that bind to hrprp with high affinity and induce resistance to pk digestion can be used to develop molecular biology assays for the screening of compounds associated with prp structure transformation or for drugs that inhibit this process
