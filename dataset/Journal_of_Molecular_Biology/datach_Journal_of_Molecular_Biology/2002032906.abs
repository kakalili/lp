nucleation and propagation of the collagen triple helix in single chain and trimerized peptides transition from third to first order kinetics edited by r huber
the kinetics of triple helix formation from single non crosslinked peptide chains were studied for the collagen models proprogly  and prohypgly  in a broad concentration range and compared with those in nucleated trimers at very low peptide concentrations the reaction order is  but decreases at higher concentrations for proprogly  the third order rate constant is   m   s   at  c which corresponds to a very long half time of  hours at   m chain concentration for prohypgly  the rate constant is about   fold higher which is consistent with the stabilizing effect of  hydroxyproline in collagens the concentration dependence of the reaction order is explained by a nucleation mechanism in which a very unstable dimer is in fast equilibrium with the monomeric chains and addition of the third chain occurs in a rate limiting step at high concentrations nucleation is faster than propagation of helix formation and propagation becomes rate limiting to test this hypothesis an artificial nucleus was introduced by fusion of proprogly  with the trimeric foldon domain of t phage or the crosslinking domain of collagen iii glyproproglyprocyscysglyglygly these domains were recombinantly attached to the c terminus of glypropro  and link the three chains in a similar way to the c terminal propeptide domain in collagen iii this results in a local intrinsic chain concentration of about  m a first order reaction is observed for the folding of the triple helix in glypropro  foldon with a half time of   minutes which approximately matches the rate of folding from single chains at  m peptide concentration a high activation energy of  kj mol is found for this reaction whereas the temperature dependence of the nucleation step is close to zero confirming earlier findings on natural collagens that cis trans isomerization of peptide bonds is the rate limiting step in propagation
