structure based design and study of non amyloidogenic double n methylated iapp amyloid core sequences as inhibitors of iapp amyloid formation and cytotoxicity edited by r huber
pancreatic amyloid is formed by the aggregation of the  residue islet amyloid polypeptide iapp in type ii diabetes patients and is cytotoxic pancreatic amyloid deposits are found in more than   of type ii diabetes patients and their formation is strongly associated with disease progression iapp amyloid forms via a conformational transition of soluble iapp into aggregated  sheets we recently identified iapp     nfgail as a minimum length sequence sufficient to self associate into  sheet containing amyloid fibrils here we have used the nfgail model of the iapp amyloid core as a structural template to design non amyloidogenic derivatives of amyloidogenic sequences of iapp that are able to interact with the native sequences and inhibit amyloid formation the design of the derivatives was based on a simple structure based minimalistic and selective n methylation approach accordingly a minimum number of two amide bonds on the same side of the  strand of the amyloid core was n methylated this was expected to eliminate the two intermolecular backbone nh to co hydrogen bonds which are critical for the extension of the  sheet dimers into multimers and amyloid other  strand  contact sides  remained intact allowing for the derivatives to interact with the native sequences double n methylated derivatives of amyloidogenic and cytotoxic partial iapp sequences generated included f n me ga n me il nf n me ga n me il snnf n me ga n me il and snnf n me ga n me ilss and were found to be devoid of  sheet structure amyloidogenicity and cytotoxicity according to fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir  congo red cr staining electron microscopy em  and cell viability tests the derivatives were able to interact with the native sequences and inhibit amyloid formation as shown by circular dichroism spectroscopy cd  ft ir and em moreover snnf n me ga n me ilss inhibited cytotoxicity of snnfgailss and is thus the first reported inhibitor of iapp amyloid formation and cytotoxicity our results demonstrate the validity of the design approach for iapp and suggest that it may find application in understanding the structural features of amyloid formation and in the development of inhibitors of amyloid formation and cytotoxicity of other amyloidogenic polypeptides as well
