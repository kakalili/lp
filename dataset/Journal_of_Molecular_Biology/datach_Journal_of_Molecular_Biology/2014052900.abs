architectures of whole module and bimodular proteins from the  deoxyerythronolide b synthase
the  deoxyerythronolide b synthase debs is a prototypical assembly line polyketide synthase produced by the actinomycete saccharopolyspora erythraea that synthesizes the macrocyclic core of the antibiotic erythromycin  deoxyerythronolide b the megasynthase is a  mda trimeric complex composed of three unique homodimers assembled from the gene products debs  debs  and debs  which are housed within the erythromycin biosynthetic gene cluster each homodimer contains two clusters of catalytically independent enzymatic domains each referred to as a module which catalyzes one round of polyketide chain extension and modification modules are named sequentially to indicate the order in which they are utilized during synthesis of  deoxyerythronolide b we report small angle x ray scattering saxs analyses of a whole module and a bimodule from debs as well as a set of domains for which high resolution structures are available in all cases the solution state was probed under previously established conditions ensuring that each protein is catalytically active saxs data are consistent with atomic resolution structures of debs fragments therefore we used the available high resolution structures of debs domains to model the architectures of the larger protein assemblies using rigid body refinement our data support a model in which the third module of debs forms a disc shaped structure capable of caging the acyl carrier protein domain proximal to each active site the molecular envelope of debs is a thin elongated ellipsoid and the results of rigid body modeling suggest that modules  and  stack collinearly along the  fold axis of symmetry
