Folding of tendamistat is a rapid two-state process for the majority of the unfolded molecules. In fluorescence-monitored refolding kinetics about 8% of the unfolded molecules fold slowly (λ=0.083s−1), limited by peptidyl-prolyl cis–trans isomerization. This is significantly less than expected from the presence of three trans prolyl-peptide bonds in the native state. In interrupted refolding experiments we detected an additional very slow folding reaction (λ=0.008s−1 at pH 2) with an amplitude of about 12%. This reaction is caused by the interconversion of a highly structured intermediate to native tendamistat. The intermediate has essentially native spectroscopic properties and about 2% of it remain populated in equilibrium after folding is complete. Catalysis by human cyclophilin 18 identifies this very slow reaction as a prolyl isomerization reaction. This shows that prolyl-isomerases are able to efficiently catalyze native state isomerization reactions, which allows them to influence biologically important regulatory conformational transitions. Folding kinetics of the proline variants P7A, P9A, P50A and P7A/P9A show that the very slow reaction is due to isomerization of the Glu6-Pro7 and Ala8-Pro9 peptide bonds, which are located in a region that makes strong backbone and side-chain interactions to both β-sheets. In the P50A variant the very slow isomerization reaction is still present but native state heterogeneity is not observed any more, indicating a long-range destabilizing effect on the alternative native state relative to N. These results enable us to include all prolyl and non-prolyl peptide bond isomerization reactions in the folding mechanism of tendamistat and to characterize the kinetic mechanism and the energetics of a native-state prolyl isomerization reaction.
