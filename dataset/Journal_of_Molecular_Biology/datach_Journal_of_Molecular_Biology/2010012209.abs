structural determinants of dna binding by a p falciparum apiap transcriptional regulator
putative transcription factors have only recently been identified in the plasmodium spp  with the major family of regulators comprising the apicomplexan apetala  ap  proteins to better understand the dna binding mechanisms of these transcriptional regulators we characterized the structure and in vitro function of an ap dna binding domain from a prototypical apicomplexan ap protein pf    from plasmodium falciparum the x ray crystal structure of the pf    ap domain bound to dna reveals a  sheet fold that binds the dna major groove through base specific and backbone contacts a prominent  helix supports the  sheet structure substitution of predicted dna binding residues with alanine weakened or eliminated dna binding in solution in contrast to plant ap domains the pf    ap domain dimerizes upon binding to dna through a domain swapping mechanism in which the  helices of the ap domains pack against the  sheets of the dimer mates dna induced dimerization of pf    may be important for tethering two distal dna loci together in the nucleus and or for inducing functional rearrangements of its domains to facilitate transcriptional regulation consistent with a multisite binding mode at least two copies of the consensus sequence recognized by pf    are present upstream of a previously identified group of sporozoite stage genes taken together these findings illustrate how plasmodium has adapted the ap dna binding domain for genome wide transcriptional regulation
