immunogenicity of peptide vaccine candidates predicted by molecular dynamics simulations
we present an in silico structure based approach for design and evaluation of conformationally restricted peptide vaccines in particular we designed four cyclic peptides of ten or  residues mimicking the crystallographically observed  turn conformation of a predicted immunodominant loop of pora from neisseria meningitidis conformational correctness and stability of the peptide designs as evaluated by molecular dynamics simulations correctly predicted the immunogenicity of the peptides we observed a peptide induced functional antibody response that remarkably exceeded the response induced by the native protein in outer membrane vesicles without losing specificity for related strains the presented approach offers tools for a priori design and selection of peptide vaccine candidates with full biological activity this approach could be widely applicable to outer membrane proteins of gram negative bacteria and to other epitopes in a large range of pathogens
