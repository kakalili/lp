il  induces conformational changes in its preassembled receptor core which then migrates in lipid raft and binds to the cytoskeleton meshwork
while interleukin il  clearly initiates the sequential assembly of its soluble receptor fragments sil r in vitro with sil r  first sil r  second and s c last  the assembly mechanism of full length subunits il r at the surface of living lymphocytes remains to be elucidated here we demonstrate by fluorescence cross correlated spectroscopy that native il r  and  c assemble spontaneously at the surface of living human leukemia t cells kit   cell line in the absence of il  and with   stoichiometry the dissociation constant of the membrane embedded il r   c complex is measured in situ f rster fluorescence resonance energy transfer analyzed by confocal microscopy of transfected cos  cells between combination pairs of various length receptor chain constructions using green fluorescent protein derivatives as cytoplasmic carboxy terminal extensions showed that il r  ecfp and  c eyfp bind each other through their extracellular domains and that il  binding brings their transmembrane domains    closer together these observations demonstrate that il r   c heterodimers are preformed and that their cytoplasmic domains carrying janus kinase jak  and jak  are pulled and tethered together on cytokine binding triggering signaling transduction il  binding stabilizes il  il r complexes in membrane nanodomains that promote jak jak phosphorylation the complexes then interact with the cytoskeleton which slows receptor diffusion as measured by fluorescence cross correlated spectroscopy and promotes stat signal transducer and activator of transcription  phosphorylation separation of il  activated receptors from triton lysed cells in detergent resistant membrane nanodomains by ultracentrifugation on a sucrose gradient confirmed their presence in lipid rafts the release of the il  activated receptor from cytochalasin treated cells and the il  induced recruitment of actin and tubulin analyzed by immunoprecipitation confirmed that the activated receptor interacts with the cytoskeleton although il r  the third chain that gives the il r   c receptor core its high affinity for il  is highly expressed at the cell surface and mainly clustered in membrane microdomains at the surface of kit   cells the few free il r  present bind last to the il  il r   c complex and lock il  to its binding site for prolonged action promoting signal amplification
