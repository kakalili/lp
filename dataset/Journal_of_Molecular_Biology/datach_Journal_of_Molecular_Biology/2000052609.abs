interaction of translation initiation factor if with the e coli ribosomal a site edited by d e draper
initiation factor  if  is required for the initiation of translation in escherichia coli however the precise function of if remains unknown current evidence suggests that if is an rna binding protein that sits in the a site of the decoding region of  s rrna if binding to  s subunits changes the reactivity of nucleotides in the a site to chemical probes the n position of a   is enhanced while the n positions of a   and a   are protected from reactivity with dimethyl sulfate dms  the n n positions of g  are also protected from reactivity with kethoxal quantitative footprinting experiments show that the dissociation constant for if binding to the  s subunit is    m and that if also alters the reactivity of a subset of class iii sites that are protected by trna   s subunits or aminoglycoside antibiotics if enhances the reactivity of the n position of a   a   and a  to dms and the n n positions of g   to kethoxal to characterize this rna protein interaction several ribosomal mutants in the decoding region rna were created and if binding to wild type and mutant  s subunits was monitored by chemical modification and primer extension with allele specific primers the mutations c  u a  g a  g or a  g disrupt if binding to  s subunits whereas the mutations g  a u  a u  g g  u u  a u  c or u  g had little effect on if binding disruption of if binding correlates with the deleterious phenotypic effects of certain mutations if binding to the a site of the  s subunit may modulate subunit association and the fidelity of trna selection in the p site through conformational changes in the  s rrna
