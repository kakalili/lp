temperature dependence of uv laser one electron oxidative guanine modifications as a probe of local stacking fluctuations and conformational transitions
by monitoring rpip rfpg i e the relative sensitivity to hot piperidine and to formamidopyrimidine dna glycosylase fpg protein of the guanine lesions induced in dna exposed to uv laser irradiation we have previously observed that the formation of the two major types of one electron oxidative guanine modifications oxazolone and   dihydro  oxoguanine  oxodg  depends on dna conformational features while oxazolone is largely predominant at each site of single stranded dna rpip gt rfpg   oxodg is the major lesion at most of the sites of double stranded dna rpip lt rfpg  in the present study we investigated the temperature dependence of rpip and rfpg at individual sites of a dna sequence during the transition between the double stranded and the melted random coiled states the striking result is that the transition curves of the ratio rpip rfpg display a shape similar to the helix  coil melting profile of the dna fragment determined from uv absorbance measurements with at individual sites subtle differences in the slope of the curves and in the temperature at the mid point of the transitions at a few guanine residues of the dna duplex rpip gt rfpg at   c and the ratio rpip rfpg does not vary significantly during the melting process interestingly these guanine residues display a high sensitivity to dimethyl sulfoxide methylation while the opposite cytosine residues are unsensitive suggesting that the prevalence of rpip over rfpg is related not to base pairing disruption but rather to the local helical alteration of the b dna stacking geometry this leads us to propose that the slight variations in the ratios rpip rfpg observed at individual sites at temperatures below the helix  coil transition reflect local small scale breathing motions unstacking single dinucleotide steps prior to opening our results thus support the view that the temperature dependence of the ratio of rpip rfpg at sites of b dna provides a sensitive probe of the dna internal local thermal stability and are discussed in relation with the mechanisms proposed for the intramolecular rearrangement of the guanyl radical
