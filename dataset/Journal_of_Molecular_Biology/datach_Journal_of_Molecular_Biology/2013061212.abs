discovery and structural characterization of a new inhibitor series of hiv  nucleocapsid function nmr solution structure determination of a ternary complex involving a   inhibitor nc stoichiometry
the nucleocapsid nc protein is an essential factor with multiple functions within the human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  replication cycle in this study we describe the discovery of a novel series of inhibitors that targets hiv  nc protein by blocking its interaction with nucleic acids this series was identified using a previously described capsid ca assembly assay employing a recombinant hiv  ca nc protein and immobilized tg rich deoxyoligonucleotides using visible absorption spectroscopy we were able to demonstrate that this new inhibitor series binds specifically and reversibly to the nc with a peculiar   stoichiometry a fluorescence polarization based binding assay was also developed in order to monitor the inhibitory activities of this series of inhibitors to better characterize the structural aspect of inhibitor binding onto nc we performed nmr studies using unlabeled and  c  n double labeled nc     protein constructs this allowed the determination of the solution structure of a ternary complex characterized by two inhibitor molecules binding to the two zinc knuckles of the nc protein to the best of our knowledge this represents the first report of a high resolution structure of a small molecule inhibitor bound to nc demonstrating sub micromolar potency and moderate antiviral potency with one analogue of the series this structure was compared with available nc oligonucleotide complex structures and further underlined the high flexibility of the nc protein allowing it to adopt many conformations in order to bind its different oligonucleotide nucleomimetic targets in addition analysis of the interaction details between the inhibitor molecules and nc demonstrated how this novel inhibitor series is mimicking the guanosine nucleobases found in many reported complex structures
