factors that determine the efficiency of hiv  strand transfer initiated at a specific site
human immunodeficiency virus  employs strand transfer for recombination between two viral genomes we have previously provided evidence that strand transfer proceeds by an invasion mediated mechanism in which a dna segment on the original rna template is invaded by a second rna template at a gap site the initial rna  dna hybrid then expands until the dna is fully transferred ribonuclease h rnase h cleavages and nucleocapsid protein nc were required for long distance propagation of the hybrid evaluation was performed on a unique substrate with a short gap serving as a precreated invasion site in our current work this substrate provided an opportunity for us to test what factors influence a specific invasion site to support transfer and to distinguish factors that influence invasion site creation from those that impact later steps rnase h can act in a polymerization dependent or polymerization independent mode polymerization dependent and polymerization independent rnase h were found to be important in creating efficiently used invasion sites in the primer  donor complex with or without nc propagation and terminus transfer steps emanating from a precreated invasion site in the presence of nc were stimulated by polymerization dependent but not polymerization independent rnase h rnase h can carry out primary and secondary cleavages during synthesis while both modes of cleavage promoted invasion only primary cleavage promoted propagation in the presence of nc in our system these observations suggest that once invasion is initiated at a short gap it can propagate through an adjacent region interrupted only by nicks with help by nc we considered the possibility that propagation solely by strand exchange was a significant contributor to transfers however it did not promote transfer even if synthetic progress of reverse transcriptase was intentionally slowed consistent with strand exchange by random walk in which rate declines precipitously with distance
