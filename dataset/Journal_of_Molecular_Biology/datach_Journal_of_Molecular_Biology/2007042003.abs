structural basis for the aldolase and epimerase activities of staphylococcus aureus dihydroneopterin aldolase
dihydroneopterin aldolase dhna catalyzes the conversion of   dihydroneopterin dhnp to  hydroxymethyl   dihydropterin hp and the epimerization of dhnp to   dihydromonopterin dhmp  although crystal structures of the enzyme from several microorganisms have been reported no structural information is available about the critical interactions between dhna and the trihydroxypropyl moiety of the substrate which undergoes bond cleavage and formation here we present the structures of staphylococcus aureus dhna sadhna in complex with neopterin np an analog of dhnp and with monapterin mp an analog of dhmp  filling the gap in the structural analysis of the enzyme in combination with previously reported sadhna structures in its ligand free form pdb entry dhn and in complex with hp pdb entry dhn  four snapshots for the catalytic center assembly along the reaction pathway can be derived advancing our knowledge about the molecular mechanism of sadhna catalyzed reactions an additional step appears to be necessary for the epimerization of dhmp to dhnp three active site residues e  k   and y  function coordinately during catalysis together they organize the catalytic center assembly and individually each plays a central role at different stages of the catalytic cycle
