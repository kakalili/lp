ligand induced assembling of the type i interferon receptor on supported lipid bilayers
type i interferons ifns elicit antiviral antiproliferative and immuno modulatory responses through binding to a shared receptor consisting of the transmembrane proteins ifnar and ifnar  differential signaling by different interferons in particular ifn s and ifn  suggests different modes of receptor engagement using reflectometric interference spectroscopy rifs  we studied kinetics and affinities of the interactions between ifns and the extracellular receptor domains of ifnar  ifnar ec and ifnar  ifnar ec  for ifn   we determined a kd value of nm and   m for the interaction with ifnar ec and ifnar ec respectively as compared to ifn   ifn  formed complexes with ifnar ec as well as ifnar ec with substantially higher affinity for neither ifn  nor ifn  was stabilization of the complex with ifnar ec in the presence of soluble ifnar ec observed we investigated ligand induced complex formation with ifnar ec and ifnar ec being tethered onto solid supported fluid lipid bilayers by rifs and total internal reflection fluorescence spectroscopy we observed very stable binding of ifn  at high receptor surface concentrations with an apparent kd value approximately   times lower than that for ifnar ec alone the apparent kd value was strongly dependent on the surface concentration of the receptor components suggesting kinetic stabilization this was corroborated by the fast exchange of labeled ifn  bound to the receptor by unlabeled ifn   taken together our results indicate that ifn first binds to ifnar and subsequently recruits ifnar in a transient fashion in particular this second step is much more efficient for ifn  than for ifn   which could explain differential activities observed for these ifns
