active site gating regulates substrate selectivity in a chymotrypsin like serine protease the structure of haemophilus influenzae immunoglobulin a protease
we report here the first structure of a member of the immunoglobulin a protease igap family at     resolution this protease is a founding member of the type v autotransporter secretion system and is considered a virulence determinant among the bacteria expressing the enzyme the structure of the enzyme fits that of a classic autotransporter in which several unique domains necessary for protein function are appended to a central     long  helical domain the n terminal domain of the igap is found to possess a chymotrypsin like fold however this catalytic domain contains a unique loop d that extends over the active site acting as a lid gating substrate access the data presented provide a structural basis for the known ability of igaps to cleave only the proline serine threonine rich hinge peptide unique to iga  isotype  in the context of the intact fold of the immunoglobulin based upon the structural data as well as molecular modeling a model suggesting that the unique extended loop d in this igap sterically occludes the active site binding cleft in the absence of immunoglobulin binding is presented only in the context of binding of the iga fc domain in a valley formed between the n terminal protease domain and another domain appended to the  helix spine domain  is the lid stabilized in an open conformation the stabilization of this open conformation through fc association subsequently allows access of the hinge peptide to the active site resulting in recognition and cleavage of the substrate
