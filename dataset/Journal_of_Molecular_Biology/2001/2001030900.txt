As part of a nutrient-responsive signaling pathway, the budding yeast cyclin-CDK complex Pho80-Pho85 phosphorylates the transcription factor Pho4 on five sites and inactivates it. Here, we describe the kinetic reaction between Pho80-Pho85 and Pho4. Through experimentation and computer modeling we have determined that Pho80-Pho85 phosphorylates Pho4 in a semi-processive fashion that results from a balance between kcat and koff. In addition, we show that Pho80-Pho85 phosphorylates certain sites preferentially. Phosphorylation of the site with the highest preference inhibits the transcriptional activity of Pho4 when it is in the nucleus, while phosphorylation of the lowest-preference sites is required for export of Pho4 from the nucleus. This method of phosphorylation may allow Pho80-Pho85 to quickly inactivate Pho4 in the nucleus and efficiently phosphorylate Pho4 to completion.
