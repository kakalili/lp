new applications for phage integrases
within the last  years bacteriophage integrases have rapidly risen to prominence as genetic tools for a wide range of applications from basic cloning to genome engineering serine integrases such as that from  c  and its relatives have found an especially wide range of applications within diverse micro organisms right through to multi cellular eukaryotes here we review the mechanisms of the two major families of integrases the tyrosine and serine integrases and the advantages and disadvantages of each type as they are applied in genome engineering and synthetic biology in particular we focus on the new areas of metabolic pathway construction and optimization biocomputing heterologous expression and multiplexed assembly techniques integrases are versatile and efficient tools that can be used in conjunction with the various extant molecular biology tools to streamline the synthetic biology production line
