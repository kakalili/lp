increased folding stability of tem   lactamase by in vitro selection
in vitro selections of stabilized proteins lead to more robust enzymes and at the same time yield novel insights into the principles of protein stability we employed proside a method of in vitro selection to find stabilized variants of tem   lactamase from escherichia coli proside links the increased protease resistance of stabilized proteins to the infectivity of a filamentous phage several libraries of tem   lactamase variants were generated by error prone pcr and variants with increased protease resistance were obtained by raising temperature or guanidinium chloride concentration during proteolytic selections despite the small size of phage libraries several strongly stabilizing mutations could be obtained and a manual combination of the best shifted the profiles for thermal unfolding and temperature dependent inactivation of  lactamase by almost    c to a higher temperature the wild type protein unfolds in two stages from the native state via an intermediate of the molten globule type to the unfolded form in the course of the selections the native protein was stabilized by   kj mol   relative to the intermediate and the cooperativity of unfolding was strongly increased three of our stabilizing replacements m  t a  v and r  l had been identified independently in naturally occurring  lactamase variants with extended substrate spectrum in these variants they acted as global suppressors of destabilizations caused by the mutations in the active site the comparison between the crystal structure of our best variant and the crystal structure of the wild type protein indicates that most of the selected mutations optimize helices and their packing the stabilization by the e  g substitution is remarkable it removes steric strain that originates from an overly tight packing of two helices in the wild type protein such unfavorable van der waals repulsions are not easily identified in crystal structures or by computational approaches but they strongly reduce the conformational stability of a protein
