We have examined expression of the λcI operon in single cells via a rex∷gfp substitution. Although average fluorescence agreed with expectations for expression of λ-repressor, fluorescence fluctuated greatly from cell-to-cell. Fluctuations in repressor concentration are not predicted by previous models and are tolerated in part by a regulatory response to DNA damage.
