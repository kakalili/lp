mapping the conformation of the nucleic acid framework of the t rna polymerase elongation complex in solution using low energy cd and fluorescence spectroscopy
the bacteriophage t elongation complex is an excellent model system in which to characterize the fundamental steps of transcription we have formed functional elongation complexes by mixing preassembled and rna primed dna  bubble  constructs with t rna polymerase and by initiating transcription at promoters and have monitored the low energy cd and fluorescence spectra of pairs of  aminopurine residues that have been inserted at defined sites within the dna and rna scaffold of the complex in this way we have been able to probe specific changes in the local conformations of the bases and base pairs at these positions as the elongation complex goes through the various steps of the nucleotide addition cycle the advantage of using pairs of  aminopurine residues inserted at defined nucleic acid positions as probes is that the rest of the complex is spectrally  transparent  at wavelengths gt   nm thus by combining cd and fluorescence measurements we obtain both structural and dynamic information that applies uniquely at each position within the functioning complex in this way we have mapped the details of steps central to transcription including the formation and translocation of the transcription bubble the formation and unwinding of the rna  dna hybrid the passage of the nascent rna through the exit channel of the polymerase and the events of the template controlled ntp selection process that controls transcriptional fidelity this approach defines specific structural aspects of the elongation process under physiological conditions and can be extended to examine other key aspects of transcriptional regulation such as termination editing pausing etc  that involve conformational rearrangements within the nucleic acid framework of the transcription complex
