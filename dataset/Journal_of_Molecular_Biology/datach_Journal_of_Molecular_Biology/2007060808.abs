hotpatch a statistical a pproach to finding biologically relevant features on protein surfaces
we describe a fully automated algorithm for finding functional sites on protein structures our method finds surface patches of unusual physicochemical properties on protein structures and estimates the patches probability of overlapping functional sites other methods for predicting the locations of specific types of functional sites exist but in previous analyses it has been difficult to compare methods when they are applied to different types of sites thus we introduce a new statistical framework that enables rigorous comparisons of the usefulness of different physicochemical properties for predicting virtually any kind of functional site the program s statistical models were trained for  individual properties electrostatics concavity hydrophobicity etc  and for  neural network combination properties all optimized and tested on  diverse protein functions to simulate what to expect if the program were run on proteins of unknown function as might arise from structural genomics we tested it on   proteins of diverse mixed functions in the higher scoring top half of all predictions a functional residue could typically be found within the first   residues chosen at random the program may or may not use partial information about the protein s function type as an input depending on which statistical model the user chooses to employ if function type is used as an additional constraint prediction accuracy usually increases and is particularly good for enzymes dna interacting sites and oligomeric interfaces the program can be accessed online at http  hotpatch mbi ucla edu
