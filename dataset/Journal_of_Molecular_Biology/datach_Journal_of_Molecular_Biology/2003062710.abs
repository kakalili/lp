microglobulin amyloidosis insights from conservation analysis and fibril modelling by protein docking techniques
current data suggest that globular domains may form amyloids via different mechanisms nevertheless there are indications that the initiation of the process takes place invariably in the less stable segments of a protein domain we have studied the sequence and structural conservation of   microglobulin that deposits into fibrils in dialysis related amyloidosis the dataset includes  high resolution non redundant structures of the antibody constant domain like proteins c  and   related sequences we describe a set of  conserved residues among them   are conserved structurally   are conserved sequentially and nine are conserved both sequentially and structurally strands a      g      and d      are the less conserved and stable segments of the domain while strands b      c      e      and f      are the conserved and stable segments we find that the conserved residues form a cluster with a network of interactions the observed pattern of conservation is consistent with experimental data including h d exchange urea denaturation and limited proteolysis that suggest that strands a and g do not participate in the amyloid fibril additionally the low conservation of strand d is consistent with the observation that this strand may acquire different conformations as seen in crystal structures of bound and isolated   microglobulin we used a docking technique to suggest a model for a fibril via stacking of   microglobulin monomers our analysis suggests that the favored monomer building block for fibril elongation is the conformation of the isolated   microglobulin without the  bulge on strand d and without strands a and g participating in the fibril  sheet structure this monomer retains all the conserved residues and their network of interactions increasing the likelihood of its existence in solution the inter strand interaction between the two monomer building blocks forms a new continuous  sheet such that addition of monomers results in a fibril model that has the characteristic cross  structure
