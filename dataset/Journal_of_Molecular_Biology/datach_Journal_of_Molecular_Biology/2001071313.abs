building novel binding ligands to b  and b  based on human antibody single variable light chain domains edited by i a wilson
ligands specific for b   cd  and b   cd  have applications in disease indications that require inhibition of t cell activity as we observed significant sequence and structural similarity between the b binding ligand cytotoxic t lymphocyte associated protein  ctla   and antibody variable light chain domains vls  we have explored the possibilities of making novel b binding molecules based on single vl domains we first describe the  rational  design and construction of a vl ctla  hybrid molecule in which we have grafted both the cdr and cdr like loops of ctla  onto a single vl light chain at sites determined by sequence and structure based alignment this molecule was secreted as a soluble product from escherichia coli but did not show any binding to b  and b   in a second approach we constructed a vl library in which human vl genes derived from b cells were spiked with the cdr like loop of ctla  and further diversified by dna shuffling this library was displayed on phage and after selection gave b  binding ligands which competed with ctla  in order to evaluate the possible general utility of vl domains as binding ligands we have constructed a non biased vl library from this dna shuffled human vl library we have selected single vl domains specific for b   b  or human igg two b  specific vl ligands and one b  specific vl ligand showed competition with ctla  one candidate vl domain specific for b  was affinity matured by simultaneous randomisation of all cdr loops using dna shuffling with degenerate cdr spiking oligonucleotides from this library a single vl domain with affinity of   nm for b  was obtained which also showed binding to b  in situ this vl had mutations in cdr and cdr  indicating that antigen recognition for this single vl is most likely mediated by the same regions as in the vl domain of whole antibodies the b  and b  specific vl domains described in this study may form the basis of a new family of immunomodulatory recombinant molecules furthermore our studies suggest that it is feasible to create specific single vl domains to diverse targets as is the case for single vh domains
