crystal structure of the vibrio cholerae colonization factor tcpf and identification of a functional immunogenic site
vibrio cholerae relies on two main virulence factors  toxin coregulated pilus tcp and cholera toxin  to cause the gastrointestinal disease cholera tcp is a type iv pilus that mediates bacterial autoagglutination and colonization of the intestine tcp is encoded by the tcp operon which also encodes tcpf a protein of unknown function that is secreted by v cholerae in a tcp dependent manner although tcpf is not required for tcp biogenesis a tcpf mutant has a colonization defect in the infant mouse cholera model that is as severe as a pilus mutant furthermore tcpf antisera protect against v cholerae infection tcpf has no apparent sequence homology to any known protein here we report the de novo x ray crystal structure of tcpf and the identification of an epitope that is critical for its function as a colonization factor a monoclonal antibody recognizing this epitope is protective against v cholerae challenge and adds to the protection provided by an anti tcpa antibody these data suggest that tcpf has a novel function in v cholerae colonization and define a region crucial for this function
