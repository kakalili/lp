structural basis of the cytoplasmic tail of adhesion molecule cd  and its binding to erm proteins
cd  leukosialin sialophorin is the major adhesion molecule in most hematopoietic cells and belongs to the sialomucin superfamily in leukocyte emigration and activation the exclusion of cd  from the immunological synapse is an essential step while the exclusion requires binding of the cytoplasmic region to erm ezrin radixin moesin proteins the detailed specific nature of the interaction between cd  and erm proteins is obscure we have characterized the conformational properties of the cd  cytoplasmic region consisting of   amino acid residues by hydrodynamic and spectroscopic measurements sedimentation equilibrium and velocity studies of ultracentrifugation revealed that the cd  cytoplasmic peptide exists in a monomeric and extended form in solution the crystal structure of the complex between the radixin ferm   and erm domain and the cd  juxtamembrane region peptide reveals that the nonpolar region of the peptide binds subdomain c of the ferm domain cd  lacks the motif  sequence for ferm binding found in the ferm  intercellular adhesion molecule  complex but possesses two conserved leucine residues that dock into the hydrophobic pocket of subdomain c without forming a   helix the ferm binding site on cd  is overlapped with the functional nuclear localization signal sequence our structure suggests that regulation of erm binding may be coupled with regulated intramembrane proteolysis of cd  followed by the nuclear transfer of the cytoplasmic peptide
