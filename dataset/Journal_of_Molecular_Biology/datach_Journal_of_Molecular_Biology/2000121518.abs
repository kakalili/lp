light induced rotation of a transmembrane  helix in bacteriorhodopsin
spin labeling epr spectroscopy has been used to characterize light induced conformational changes of bacteriorhodopsin br  pairs of nitroxide spin labels were attached to engineered cysteine residues at strategic positions near the cytoplasmic ends of transmembrane  helices b f and g in order to monitor distance changes upon light activation the epr analysis of six doubly labeled br mutants indicates that the cytoplasmic end of helix f not only tilts outwards but also rotates counter clockwise during the photocycle the direction of the rotation of helix f is the opposite of the clockwise rotation previously reported for bovine rhodopsin the opposite chirality of the f helix rotation in the two systems is perhaps related to the differences in the cis trans photoisomerization of the retinal in the two proteins using time resolved epr we monitored the rotation of helix f also in real time and found that the signal from the rotation arises concurrently with the reprotonation of the retinal schiff base
