the anti cancer drug chlorambucil as a substrate for the human polymorphic enzyme glutathione transferase p   kinetic properties and crystallographic characterisation of allelic variants
the commonly used anti cancer drug chlorambucil is the primary treatment for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia chlorambucil has been shown to be detoxified by human glutathione transferase pi gst p   an enzyme that is often found over expressed in cancer tissues the allelic variants of gst p  are associated with differing susceptibilities to leukaemia and differ markedly in their efficiency in catalysing glutathione gsh conjugation reactions here we perform detailed kinetic studies of the allelic variants with the aid of three representative co substrates we show that the differing catalytic properties of the variants are highly substrate dependent we show also that all variants exhibit the same temperature stability in the range    c to    c we have determined the crystal structures of gst p  in complex with chlorambucil and its gsh conjugate for two of these allelic variants that have different residues at positions   and   chlorambucil is found to bind in a non productive mode to the substrate binding site h site in the absence of gsh this result suggests that under certain stress conditions where gsh levels are low gst p  can inactivate the drug by sequestering it from the surrounding medium however in the presence of gsh chlorambucil binds in the h site in a productive mode and undergoes a conjugation reaction with gsh present in the crystal the crystal structure of the gsh  chlorambucil complex bound to the c variant is identical with the a variant ruling out the hypothesis that primary structure differences between the variants cause structural changes at the active site finally we show that chlorambucil is a very poor inhibitor of the enzyme in contrast to ethacrynic acid which binds to the enzyme in a similar fashion but can act as both substrate and inhibitor
