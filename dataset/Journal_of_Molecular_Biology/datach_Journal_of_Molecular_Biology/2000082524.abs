highly efficient selection of phage antibodies mediated by display of antigen as lpp ompa  fusions on live bacteria edited by j wells
delayed infectivity panning dip is a novel approach for the in vivo isolation of interacting protein pairs dip combines phage display and cell surface display of polypeptides as follows an antigen is displayed in many copies on the surface of f escherichia coli cells by fusing it to a lpp ompa  hybrid to prevent premature non specific infection by phage the cells are rendered functionally f  by growth at   c the antigen displaying cells are used to capture antibody displaying phage by virtue of the antibody antigen interaction following removal of unbound phage infection of the cells by bound phage is initiated by raising the temperature to   c that facilitates f pilus expression the phage then dissociate from the antigen and infect the bacteria through the f pilus using specific scfv antibodies and the human erbb proto oncogene and il r  chain as model antibody antigen pairs we demonstrate enrichment of those phage that display a specific antibody over phage that display an irrelevant antibody of over      in a single dip cycle we further show the successful isolation of anti toxin anti receptor anti enzyme and anti peptide antibodies from several immune phage libraries a shuffled library and a large synthetic human library the effectiveness of dip makes it suitable for the isolation of rare clones present in large libraries since dip can be applied for most of the phage libraries already existing it could be a powerful tool for the rapid isolation and characterization of binders in numerous protein protein interactions
