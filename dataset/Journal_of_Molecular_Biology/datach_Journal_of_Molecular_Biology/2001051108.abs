human genetic disorders a phylogenetic perspective edited by j karn
when viewed from the perspective of time human genetic disorders give new insights into their etiology and evolution here we have correlated a specific set of alu repetitive dna elements known to be the basis of certain genetic defects with their phylogenetic roots in primate evolution from a differential distribution of alu repeats among primate species we identify the phylogenetic roots of three human genetic diseases involving the lpl apob and hprt genes the different phylogenetic age of these genetic disorders could explain the different susceptibility of various primate species to genetic diseases our results show that lpl deficiency is the oldest and should affect humans apes and monkeys apob deficiency should affect humans and great apes while a disorder in the hprt gene leading to the lesch nyhan syndrome is unique to human chimpanzee and gorilla similar results can be obtained for cancer we submit that de novo transpositions of alu elements and saltatory appearances of alu mediated genetic disorders represent singularities places where behavior changes suddenly alu s  propensity to spread not only increased the regulatory and developmental complexity of the primate genome it also increased its instability and susceptibility to genetic defects and cancer the dynamic spread not only provided markers of primate phylogeny it must have actively shaped the course of that phylogeny
