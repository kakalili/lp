crystal structure of auracyanin a  blue  copper protein from the green thermophilic photosynthetic bacterium chloroflexus aurantiacus edited by r huber
auracyanin b one of two similar blue copper proteins produced by the thermophilic green non sulfurphotosynthetic bacterium chloroflexus aurantiacus crystallizes in space group p   a b      c      the structure was solved usingmultiple wavelength anomalous dispersion data recorded about the cu k absorption edge and was refined at    resolution the molecular model comprises   amino acid residues one cu   h o molecules onecl  and two so    the final residual and estimated standard uncertainties are r    esu     for atomic coordinates and esu     for cu  ligandbond lengths respectively the auracyanin b molecule has a standard cupredoxin fold with the exception of an additionaln terminal strand the molecule is very similar to that of the bacterial cupredoxin azurin as in other cupredoxins one of the culigands lies on strand  of the polypeptide and the other three lie along a large loop between strands  and  the cu sitegeometry is discussed with reference to the amino acid spacing between the latter three ligands the crystallographicallycharacterized cu binding domain of auracyanin b is probably tethered to the periplasmic side of the cytoplasmic membrane by ann terminal tail that exhibits significant sequence identity with known tethers in several other membrane associatedelectron transfer proteins
