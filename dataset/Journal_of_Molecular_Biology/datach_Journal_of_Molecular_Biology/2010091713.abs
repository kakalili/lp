membrane docking geometry and target lipid stoichiometry of membrane bound pkc  c domain a combined molecular dynamics and experimental study
protein kinase c  pkc  possesses a conserved c domain pkc  c domain that acts as a ca  regulated membrane targeting element upon activation by ca  the pkc  c domain directs the kinase protein to the plasma membrane thereby stimulating an array of cellular pathways at sufficiently high ca  concentrations binding of the c domain to the target lipid phosphatidylserine ps is sufficient to drive membrane association however at typical physiological ca  concentrations binding to both ps and phosphoinositidyl   bisphosphate pip  is required for specific plasma membrane targeting recent epr studies have revealed the membrane docking geometries of the pkc  c domain docked to i ps alone and ii both ps and pip simultaneously these two epr docking geometries exhibit significantly different tilt angles relative to the plane of the membrane presumably induced by the large size of the pip headgroup the present study utilizes the two epr docking geometries as starting points for molecular dynamics simulations that investigate atomic features of the protein membrane interaction the simulations yield approximately the same pip triggered change in tilt angle observed by epr moreover the simulations predict a pip c stoichiometry approaching   at a high pip mole density direct binding measurements titrating the c domain with pip in lipid bilayers yield a   stoichiometry at moderate mole densities and a saturating   stoichiometry at high pip mole densities thus the experiment confirms the target lipid stoichiometry predicted by epr guided molecular dynamics simulations potential biological implications of the observed docking geometries and pip stoichiometries are discussed
