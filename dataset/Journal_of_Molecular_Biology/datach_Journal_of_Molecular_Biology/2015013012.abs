model for the architecture of claudin based paracellular ion channels through tight junctions
claudins are main cell  cell adhesion molecules of tight junctions tjs between cells in epithelial sheets that form tight barriers that separate the apical from the basolateral space but also contain paracellular channels that regulate the flow of ions and solutes in between these intercellular spaces recently the first crystal structure of a claudin was determined that of claudin   which indicated the parts of the large extracellular domains that likely form the pore lining surfaces of the paracellular channels however the crystal structure did not show how claudin molecules are arranged in the cell membrane to form the backbone of tj strands and to mediate interactions between adjacent cells information that is essential to understand how the paracellular channels in tjs function here we propose that tj strands consist of claudin protomers that assemble into antiparallel double rows this model is based on cysteine crosslinking experiments that show claudin  to dimerize face to face through interactions between the edges of the extracellular  sheets strands observed by freeze fracture electron microscopy of tjs also show that their width is consistent with the dimensions of a claudin dimer furthermore we propose that extracellular variable regions are responsible for head to head interactions of tj strands in adjoining cells thus resulting in the formation of paracellular channels our model of the tj architecture provides a basis to discuss structural mechanisms underlying the selective ion permeability and barrier properties of tjs
