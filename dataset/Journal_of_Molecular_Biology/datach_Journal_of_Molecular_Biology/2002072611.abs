functional importance of nucleotide identities within the pea atp mitochondrial promoter sequence
sequences ranging from nucleotide positions    to  relative to the transcription start site constitute an in vitro functional pea atp promoter a comparison of respective sequence segments surrounding  unambiguously identified transcription initiation sites of various dicotyledoneous plant species revealed the highest level of evolutionary fidelity of nucleotide identities within the conserved nonanucleotide motif cnm  suggesting their importance for promoter function using a mitochondrial in vitro transcription system a detailed analysis by site directed mutagenesis now reveals that the alteration of nucleotides   to   and  within the cnm indeed reduces promoter activity by more than   changes of nucleotide identities at the less conserved positions    to   within the at rich region reduced the initiation efficiency by about   the alteration of the highly conserved position   has little influence on promoter function indicating that evolutionary conservation does not always correlate with the functional importance of certain nucleotides mutagenesis of nucleotides at positions  or  reveals a minimal requirement of at least one purine for wild type transcription initiation efficiency the assignment of functionally important nucleotide identities should now facilitate an efficient and reliable prediction of other promoters in mitochondria of dicotyledon plants
